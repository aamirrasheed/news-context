### Set up Conda Virtual Environment
1. Create a python3.6 environment named "cs230" using conda using `conda create --name cs230 python=3.6`
2. Activate environment using `source activate cs230`
3. Install any python packages as needed such as `gensim` by using `conda install`

### Set up PyCharm
1. Download PyCharm (authenticating with Stanford email should give you a full year free)
2. Once PyCharm is set up, open the **news-context** directory as a project
3. For the python interpreter, select the one you used for the cs230 virtual environment. It'll be in your anaconda home directory. 
For me, it was `~/anaconda/envs/bin/python3.6`
4. Should be all good to go!
