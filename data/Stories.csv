Scaramucci said Trump had named Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to replace Spicer as press secretary. Spicer would continue as press secretary through August 2017, Sanders said.
Trump said of Spicer, “I am grateful for Sean’s work on behalf of my administration and the American people. I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities: Just look at his great television ratings.” 
“It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the President and the American people,” Spicer said in an email to the White House press on Aug. 31, 2017, his last official day as press secretary. The email was tweeted by USA Today White House correspondent Gregory Korte. 
Of Scaramucci, Trump said, “Anthony is a person I have great respect for, and he will be an important addition to this administration. He has been a great supporter and will now help implement key aspects of our agenda while leading the communications team.”

15961,2017-07-24,Trump adviser Kushner testifies before Senate committee,"Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, spoke on Monday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee is investigating alleged Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which Russia denies, and whether Trump campaign officials may have coordinated with Russia to do so.
Prior to the closed-door session, Kushner publicly released an 11-page statement. Kushner, who had worked on Trump’s campaign as a digital strategist, wrote, “I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts.” 
Kushner’s statement said, “With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any,” adding that he had “perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives” during the campaign and transition period.
Kushner is also scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to respond to questions on the same topic.
Highlights of Kushner’s written statement

	Kushner filed an SF-86 form to gain security clearance as a White House adviser. The initial version of the form, filed on Jan. 18, did not include contacts with foreign officials. The next day, his team filed an addendum stating he had “numerous contacts with foreign officials” and would provide further details. In a subsequent update, he provided a list of more than 100 foreign officials.
	Kushner said the incomplete form was filed due to a communication error with his assistant. He wrote, “People at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed.”
	Kushner also referred to a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others, organized by Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. According to Kushner’s statement, he arrived late to the meeting, “quickly determined that [his] time was not well-spent at [the] meeting,” and emailed his assistant to call his cell phone so he could have an “excuse” to leave the meeting. He said he had not spoken to the lawyer since.
	Kushner discussed two meetings with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak. The first time was in April 2016, when Trump was giving a foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where Kushner said they shook hands and exchanged “pleasantries.” The second time was at Trump Tower on Dec. 1, 2016, and Kushner said the ambassador “wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria.”
	Kushner confirmed he met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned VneshEconomBank (VEB), on Dec. 13. He said he attended the meeting in part because Kislyak said Gorkov “had a direct relationship” with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Previously, VEB said Gorkov met with Kushner because of Kushner’s real estate development business. Kushner disagreed with this account of the meeting, CNN reported. VEB has been subject to U.S. sanctions since July 2014.

43829,2017-08-01,Venezuela elects members for new ‘Constituent Assembly’ with power to rewrite the constitution,"Venezuelans voted on Sunday to allow President Nicolas Maduro to create a new legislative body called a “Constituent Assembly,” or “la constituyente,” which will have the power to rewrite the country’s constitution. Voters were asked to elect 545 members for the assembly from a list of 6,000 candidates. The election did not give Venezuelans an option to vote against the assembly’s creation, according to The New York Times. This will be the second time Venezuela has had a Constituent Assembly. The first one was in 1999, Al Jazeera reports.
On Sunday night, the National Electoral Council (CNE) said 8.1 million people voted in the election, which is about 41.5 percent of registered voters. (Venezuela's population is about 31 million people.) The investment bank Torino Capital and pollster Innovarium reported different figures and estimated between 3.1 and 4 million people voted, based on exit polls. 
The election did not include electoral observers — independent parties that assess election processes — or mechanisms to prevent people from voting more than once, The Wall Street Journal reported. The New York Times said that the government barred it and other news outlets from entering polling stations. 
On Monday, after the vote, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Maduro and other current and former government officials. The sanctions prohibit Americans from engaging in economic dealings with Maduro, and freeze any of his assets under U.S. jurisdiction.
Opposition and protests
The opposition boycotted the election and had no candidates on the ballot, CNN reported. Maduro said that two weeks ago his representatives offered to allow the opposition to add candidates and delay the vote by 15 days. He said the opposition did not accept the offer and called the vote illegitimate.
On July 16, the opposition held an unofficial referendum on whether people supported or disapproved of the creation of a Constituent Assembly. The Wall Street Journal reported that 7.5 million participated in that referendum and The New York Times said 98 percent of voters were opposed to rewriting the Constitution.
At least 125 people have been killed during protests since April, according to the Venezuelan attorney general's office. Police used tear gas against protesters in Caracas on Sunday, CNN reports; the National Guard was also present at the demonstrations. Explosions reportedly occurred in the Altamira area.
On Saturday night, one of the Constituent Assembly candidates, José Félix Pineda, was killed in his house. Opposition leader Ricardo Campos was reported dead on Sunday morning. Both deaths are being investigated by state prosecutors.

42750,2017-08-08,"Chicago sues US Attorney General, asking judge to block immigration policy affecting law enforcement funding","The city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The city is asking the court to stop the government from enforcing a new immigration policy requiring cities to comply with certain conditions in order to receive federal law enforcement funding.
The new conditions include sharing information on immigration status with federal officials, giving 48 hours notice before releasing people with possible immigration violations, and giving federal officials access to detention facilities. Cities need to comply with these conditions in order to be eligible for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, which would provide Chicago with $3.2 million this year. The city received $2.3 million from such grants last year.
Chicago currently prohibits police from giving federal immigration officials access to people in custody unless there is a criminal warrant or there are “serious” criminal convictions, the Chicago Tribune reported. According to Fox News, there are an estimated 200 to 608 local and state governments with similar policies in place, sometimes referred to as “sanctuary policies.”

42764,2017-08-08,Tropical Storm Franklin projected to reach Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula Monday night,"Tropical Storm Franklin is projected to make landfall on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula Monday night. A tropical storm warning has been issued and hurricane conditions are possible for parts of the Yucatan Peninsula. Hurricane conditions are defined as wind speeds greater than 74 mph, according to The Washington Post, while a tropical storm warning means that wind speeds of greater than 40 mph are expected.
Three to six inches of rain, with up to 12 inches in some areas, are projected for Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula, and there may be flash flooding. Waves greater than 10 feet could reach the eastern coast of the peninsula, including Cozumel and Cancun. The storm is projected by the National Hurricane Center to pass into the Gulf of Mexico late Tuesday, and is expected to make landfall in eastern Mexico on Thursday as a hurricane. While Franklin is not forecast to directly affect the U.S., Texas could experience “high surf, rip current, and possibly some minor coastal flooding” on Wednesday and Thursday, according to The Weather Channel.

42773,2017-08-08,"Israel announces plan to close Al Jazeera offices, remove network from air","Israel announced plans to close news outlet Al Jazeera’s Jerusalem offices, revoke its journalists’ press credentials, and take its Arabic and English channels off the air. Israeli Communications Minister Ayoub Kara made the announcement about the Qatari state-funded network on Sunday, saying, “We have based our decision on the move by Sunni Arab states to close the Al Jazeera offices and prohibiting their work.”
Kara said Al Jazeera is being used to “incite” violence and alleged that the outlet “backs terrorism.” Al Jazeera has denied the allegations. The news outlet said in a statement that it “stresses that it will closely watch the developments that may result from the Israeli decision and will take the necessary legal measures towards it.”
Kara asked the Government Press Office (GPO) to revoke press passes held by the network’s journalists. Al Jazeera’s Israeli journalists are members of the Foreign Press Association, and most have government-vetted GPO credentials, The Jerusalem Post reported. Kara said cable television providers have agreed to take the network off the air.
Kara asked Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman to close Al Jazeera’s Israeli offices. Kara said he would propose legislation that would allow the government to favor security concerns over freedom of expression in certain circumstances.

42785,2017-08-09,US federal climate report says climate change “extremely likely” to be linked to human influence,"A draft report written by scientists from 13 U.S. federal agencies was published by The New York Times on Monday. The report said it’s “extremely likely” that more than half of the increase in global temperature measured since 1951 can be linked to human influence. It concluded with “very high confidence, affected to some degree by limitations in the observational record, that the role of natural variability on future climate change is limited.”
The draft is part of a National Climate Assessment mandated by the U.S. Congress to take place every four years. A draft was finished earlier this year, and was previously available online for public review between December 2016 and February 2017. The National Academy of Sciences has approved the report, and its authors are waiting for permission to officially release it.

42876,2017-08-11,US Navy destroyer sails within 12 miles of artificial island in South China Sea,"On Thursday, the guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain sailed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef, an artificial island built by China, in what the Pentagon calls a “freedom of navigation” exercise. Twelve nautical miles is an internationally-recognized territorial boundary. Sailing within that boundary shows a country does not recognize a territorial claim, according to Reuters.
China’s Foreign Ministry responded to the U.S. operation, saying it violated international and Chinese law, and that “China is very displeased with this and will bring up the issue with the U.S. side.” 
Mischief Reef is one of seven artificial islands built by China in the Spratly Islands archipelago. Three of these have runways and military installations. China’s territorial claims in the area have been disputed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. About $5 trillion in trade passes through the South China Sea each year.

42936,2017-08-16,US CBO estimate: ending ACA cost-sharing subsidies would increase healthcare premiums by 20%,"The nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis on Tuesday, stating that if the U.S. government stopped funding the Affordable Care Act’s cost-sharing subsidies, premiums on silver healthcare plans would increase by 20 percent next year. 
The CBO also projected the federal budget deficit would increase by $194 million over the next 10 years, as the estimated premium increases would lead to more government subsidies for low- and moderate-income healthcare participants.
The federal government currently pays the cost-sharing subsidies directly to insurers, reimbursing them for reducing deductibles and co-payments for low-income people. Healthcare enrollees incur co-payments, or out-of-pocket costs, for visiting the doctor, receiving hospital care and filling prescriptions. The federal subsidies are only available to people buying silver level healthcare plans on the ACA’s exchanges.
In 2014, Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit against the White House alleging that the Obama administration was funding these subsidies illegally because Congress had not appropriated money for that purpose. The case is still pending. The current administration has been providing money for the subsidies on a month-to-month basis. President Trump has said he was considering ending the subsidies.

16953,2017-08-18,A guide to Confederate monuments by state,"In the U.S., there are at least 718 monuments and statues, 109 public schools, 80 cities or counties, 10 U.S. military bases, and nine state holidays representing or honoring the Confederacy or its leaders, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). While some states have laws or ordinances prohibiting the removal of such monuments, at least 14 statues have been removed since 2015. Some decisions to remove statues have occurred after multiple public debates, followed by a city council vote.
The statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, has been the most widely covered in the media over the past week. The following is a list of other states that have removed Confederate monuments, and states that prohibit such action:
Removal efforts by state:
California: On Aug. 16, the United Daughters of the Confederacy asked the Hollywood Forever Cemetery to remove a 1925 Confederate monument that marked the graves of at least 30 Confederate veterans and family members, according to CNN. The monument had been featured in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. The United Daughters, who own the statue, didn’t provide a reason for the removal. However, a Change.org petition was drafted requesting the owners remove the monument.
Florida: In May, the Alachua County Commission in Gainesville, Florida, voted 4-1 to donate the town’s Confederate statue to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which had originally installed the statue at the county’s Administration Building in 1904. The group had 60 days to decide whether to accept the donation and pay for its removal. On Aug. 14, the association paid to relocate the statue to a local cemetery. After holding three meetings on whether to remove the statue, the county commission voted to replace the statue with something that “represents the shared values” of its residents, according to the Gainesville Sun. Although the article says that the debate about the statue began in 2015 after Dylann Roof killed nine African-American churchgoers, it didn’t provide the reason for its eventual removal.
In June, the city of Orlando began the process of moving a Confederate statue from Lake Eola Park to a cemetery. The statue was originally given to the city in 1911 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In May, the mayor gave his reasons for removal: “These statues are subject to various interpretations. Some, like myself, see them as historical markers dedicated to men who died during a war. Other perceive it as a symbol of white supremacy and the vestige of slavery. With this understanding and our City’s commitment to inclusiveness, I am proposing to move the statue to a more appropriate location at Greenwood Cemetery within the confederate veterans section.” He added, “As we move this plan forward, I believe this proposal balances the inclusive morals of our community today, while carefully preserving historic artifacts from our past that can be used to further educate and serve as important lessons in today’s society.”
Kentucky: In April 2016, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced plans to remove a Confederate monument from 1895. Fischer cited “practical” reasons, such as new traffic patterns around the statue, and “civic” reasons, such as residents having objected to a Confederate monument on public land. After his announcement, a group of residents and the Sons of Confederate Veterans filed a lawsuit against its removal. The city ultimately won the lawsuit and relocated the statue to Brandenburg, Kentucky, in November 2016.
Louisiana: In December 2015, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu signed an ordinance calling for the removal and relocation of four Confederate monuments displayed on public property in the city. The city council approved the ordinance by a 6-to-1 vote and declared the monuments public “nuisances” pursuant to Section 146-611 of the city code. In April 2017, the mayor announced plans to remove the first of the four monuments. The mayor said at the time that the city came to this decision “after a lengthy public process that determined these statues failed to appropriately reflect the values of diversity and inclusion that make New Orleans strong today.” The last monument was removed in May.
Maryland: In July 2017, a statue of a Confederate soldier was removed from Rockville, Maryland’s Red Brick Courthouse. According to The New York Times, the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated the statue in 1913 and County Executive Isiah Leggett ordered its removal from government property in 2015. Upon its removal, Leggett said, “this statue is inaccurate because it pays tribute only to the more than 200 Montgomery County young men who fought for the Confederacy, not also to those County residents who fought to preserve the Union and free those held in bondage. Therefore the statue does not represent a balanced view of our County’s sacrifice during the Civil War.”
In August, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh ordered the removal of four Confederate statues in the city. In an interview with The New York Times, Mayor Pugh said it was in the “best interest” of the city, citing security concerns after the protest in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Times says the city hasn’t announced plans for their relocation.
Missouri: St. Louis officials began dismantling a Confederate statue in a park in June. Though media outlets mention that the statue was often vandalized, they don’t provide a reason for its removal. Under a legal agreement, the Missouri Civil War Museum has agreed to take ownership of the statue and its removal.
  More states: New York, Wisconsin, Alabama, Georgia, Texas and Washington have either made plans or are reviewing plans to remove some of their Confederate monuments, with some noting societal divisions as the motive for their removal, according to CNN. 
Officials from Arizona and Pennsylvania have opposed the removal of their state’s Confederate monuments. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said, “It’s not my desire or mission to tear down any monuments or memorials. We have a public process for this. If the public wants to be engaged on this, I’d invite them to get engaged in it.” And Pennsylvania’s Gettysburg National Military Park said it has no plans to remove any of its “1,300-plus monuments, markers or plaques.” 
Some states that prohibit statue removal:
Georgia: Title 50, article 3, section 1 of the state’s code says “It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, or other entity to mutilate, deface, defile, or abuse contemptuously any publicly owned monument, plaque, marker, or memorial which is dedicated to, honors, or recounts the military service of any past or present military personnel of this state, the United States of America or the several states thereof, or the Confederate States of America or the several states thereof, and no officer, body, or representative of state or local government or any department, agency, authority, or instrumentality thereof shall remove or conceal from display any such monument, plaque, marker, or memorial for the purpose of preventing the visible display of the same. A violation of this paragraph shall constitute a misdemeanor.”
Mississippi: State code 55-15-81, enacted in 2013, says no “War Between the States” monuments or memorials on public property shall be “relocated, removed, disturbed, altered, renamed or rededicated,” unless the structure interferes with the “construction, maintenance or operation of public transportation facilities.”
North Carolina: The “Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015” restricts the removal, relocation or alteration of any monument located on public property without the approval of the “North Carolina Historical Commission.”
South Carolina: Section 10-1-165 of the state constitution says no “War Between the States” monuments or memorials “erected on public property of the State or any of its political subdivisions may be relocated, removed, disturbed, or altered.” The statute may change “upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly.”
Tennessee: This state’s “Heritage Protection Act” of 2016 also prohibits the removal of statues, monuments, etc., erected to honor military conflicts, historical military figures and events, or historic organizations located on public property.

42960,2017-08-21,Trump to ‘update’ US on ‘engagement’ in Afghanistan,"U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to “provide an update on the path forward for America’s engagement in Afghanistan and South Asia,” the White House said. The presidential address is planned for Monday evening at 9 p.m. ET, and will be given from Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia.
On Friday, Trump, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other administration officials met at Camp David, the presidential retreat, to determine U.S. strategy regarding Afghanistan.
Conflict has been ongoing in Afghanistan since 2001 when the U.S. invaded to fight the Taliban and al Qaeda after the September 11 attacks. In 2014, then-President Barack Obama ended combat operations, while U.S. forces remained in Afghanistan primarily for training and advising Afghan troops. There are currently 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. 
In April of this year, the U.S. dropped a non-nuclear MOAB bomb on Afghanistan, targeting Islamic State fighters.

42963,2017-08-21,Record number of asylum-seekers enter Canada,"Canada’s national police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), reported that more than 7,000 people have entered Canada illegally since June 1. RCMP spokesperson Claude Castonguay said its officers “have never seen such numbers coming in.” 
According to the RCMP, 80 to 85 percent of the asylum seekers are Haitians, primarily coming from the U.S. The Haitians might be moving across the border because their temporary protected status (TPS) in the U.S. is scheduled to expire in January 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, DHS implemented the TPS program, allowing Haitians to work in the U.S. without being deported. Canada adopted a similar program that ended in 2016, the CBC reported.
“Coming to Canada, asking for asylum in Canada is not a guarantee for permanent residence in Canada,” Louis Dumas, spokesman for Canada’s immigration ministry, said at a press conference on Thursday. Dumas added that 50 percent of Haitians who filed for asylum in 2016 were rejected. He also said information that had been circulating on social media claiming that the Canadian government had invited asylum seekers into the country was false.
Asylum seekers have been temporarily placed in centers in Montreal and Laval, Quebec, and in Cornwall, Ontario.

42966,2017-08-21,Iraqi forces begin operation to take Tal Afar from IS,"Iraqi military commanders say their forces have begun an operation to take the city of Tal Afar from the Islamic State (IS). 
According to the commanders, the groups involved in the operation will include the Iraqi army, Federal Police, the U.S.-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service and possibly members of the Shi’ite Popular Mobilization Forces. 
There are currently an estimated 2,000 IS soldiers in Tal Afar, according to Iraqi and U.S. military commanders. The U.S.-led coalition also estimates there are between 10,000 and 50,000 civilians left in the city. The United Nations reported that around 49,000 people have left the area since April.
Tal Afar is located 50 miles (80 km) west of Mosul and 93 miles (150 km) east of the Syrian border. The city has been held by the Islamic State since 2014. Before the war started, it had a population of 200,000, Reuters reported.

42976,2017-08-22,Suspected driver in Barcelona van attack killed,"On Monday, the suspected driver in last week’s van attack in Barcelona was killed by police in the town of Subirats, Spain. The man, Younes Abouyaaqoub, a 22 year-old Moroccan, was wearing what appeared to be an explosive vest when police shot him. The vest was later determined to be fake after police used a robot to examine it.
Last Thursday, a van drove into pedestrians on Las Ramblas, a boulevard in Barcelona. Thirteen people were killed and more than 130 were wounded. Fifty of the injured were still in hospitals on Monday, with twelve of them in critical condition.
Police said Abouyaaqoub left the scene of the attack on foot and walked for about 90 minutes to the university district where he allegedly stabbed and killed Pau Perez, a 34-year-old Spaniard, while stealing his car. Media outlets report Abouyaaquob then drove the car, with Perez’s body in the back seat, through a police checkpoint to get out of Barcelona. Police later found the abandoned the car with Perez’s body in it.

42980,2017-08-22,US Secret Service estimates it will reach compensation limits before year’s end,"U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph Alles said Monday about 1,100 agents will exceed federal pay limits by the end of the year.

Last year, Congress approved a bill to pay more than 1,000 agents who earned overtime above federally-mandated limits. The Secret Service currently protects 42 people under President Donald Trump, including 18 of his family members. Thirty-one people were under Secret Service protection during the Obama administration. The agency has requested $60 million in additional funding for next year.

43012,2017-08-25,Hurricane Harvey forecast to make landfall in Texas,"Tropical storm “Harvey” in the Gulf of Mexico intensified into a hurricane on Thursday and is expected to make landfall along the Texas coast on Friday or Saturday.

43021,2017-08-25,US federal judge rules against amended Texas voter-ID bill,"On Wednesday, a U.S. federal judge blocked Texas from implementing an amended version of its voter identification law, ruling that changes made to the law did not “fully ameliorate” practices the court concluded were “enacted with discriminatory intent.” 
The original law, passed in Texas in 2011, required voters to present one of seven types of government-issued photo identification in order to cast an election ballot. The types included a driver’s license, military ID, state photo ID, passport and gun permit. At the time, federal judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, said the law had the intent to discriminate against African-Americans and Hispanics.
Earlier this year, the Texas legislature modified the bill, previously known as Senate Bill 14, to grant voters permission to show more available types of identification if they signed a document stating they could not obtain one of the official forms of ID. 
In a 27-page document, Gonzales Ramos wrote that the new legislation, Senate Bill 5, “does not meaningfully expand the types of photo IDs that can qualify.”
Texas’ attorney general said in a statement that the bill did not have “discriminatory purpose or effect.” The Texas state government said it would appeal the ruling. 
Prior to the ruling, the new legislation had been scheduled to take effect in January 2018.

43036,2017-08-29,Trump revokes directive limiting military equipment access for law enforcement,"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday afternoon revoking Executive Order 13688 signed by former President Barack Obama on Jan. 16, 2015. The new directive effectively revokes a list of prohibited military equipment for law enforcement agencies, which included tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft, grenade launchers, bayonets, camouflaged uniforms, and firearms of 0.50 caliber and higher.
Obama issued the executive order after people protested the August 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. At the protests, police were equipped with riot gear, sniper rifles and armored vehicles. 
Obama’s order created a Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group that published a report in May 2015. The report recommended, in addition to the prohibited equipment list, a “controlled” equipment list that could be acquired by law enforcement agencies with “detailed justification.” The latter list included unmanned aerial vehicles, wheeled-armored and tactical vehicles, riot batons, helmets, shields, explosives and pyrotechnics, among other items.

43048,2017-08-30,Fox News stops broadcasting in the UK,"21st Century Fox said it would stop broadcasting its subsidiary Fox News in the U.K. on Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. local time. The company said it decided that continuing to broadcast Fox News in the country was not in its “commercial interest.”
Fox said in a statement that the channel ""is focused on the U.S. market and designed for a U.S. audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the U.K.” 
Fox News was being broadcast on Sky, a pay-TV broadcaster that has 22 million customers in the U.K., Italy, Germany, Austria and Ireland. 21st Century Fox, owned by Rupert Murdoch, proposed in December to purchase the remaining 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own for $15 billion.

43051,2017-08-30,Iran says military bases are ‘off limits’ to IAEA nuclear inspectors,"Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Tuesday that the country’s military bases were “off limits” for inspection following the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.’s request that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigate the country’s military sites.
Ambassador Nikki Haley said last Friday that the IAEA should verify that Iran was upholding the 2015 nuclear agreement. Nobakht said, “Iran’s military sites are off limits.” He added, “All information about these sites are classified. Iran will never allow such visits.”
The 2015 deal allows IAEA inspectors to request access to military bases if they show evidence that Iran may have violated the agreement at the sites. There have been no reports that the U.S. has submitted such evidence, according to Reuters.
Under the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of certain international sanctions. IAEA inspectors have confirmed that Iran has been complying with the deal thus far.

43057,2017-08-30,Illinois attorney general files suit seeking federal oversight of Chicago police reform,"Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a lawsuit against Chicago on Tuesday, seeking federal oversight of an effort to reform the city’s police department. 
The suit stated that the state of Illinois “seeks to enjoin” the police department “from engaging in a repeated pattern of using excessive force, including deadly force, and other misconduct that disproportionately harms Chicago’s African-American and Latino residents.”
Madigan and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the lawsuit together. “To combat violence and rebuild trust, we need true police reform and accountability,” Madigan said. 
In January, under former president Barack Obama, the Justice Department (DOJ) released a report saying the Chicago Police Department was using excessive force and targeting African-Americans and Latinos. The DOJ and the city also issued a “statement of agreement” to reform the police department’s policies. The mayor’s office said in June that it was in negotiations with the DOJ to set up an independent body that would oversee reform. Emanuel later said the department had exited the talks.

Trump also said, “It’s time to give the American workers the pay raise that they have been looking for for many, many years.” He said that among the proposed tax reforms would be incentives for child care. 
Before the speech, the White House said the president would offer few details on proposed tax reforms.
In April, the Trump administration outlined a proposal for reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, and the number of individual income tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 10, 25 and 35 percent. The current rate for the highest earners is 39.6 percent. The proposal also included eliminating some tax deductions.
Negotiations on tax reform are reportedly occurring in private between Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Republican congressional leaders. Congress reconvenes from its current recess in September.

43069,2017-08-31,US federal judge blocks parts of Texas law on immigration enforcement,"On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia in San Antonio blocked parts of a Texas law that would have made it illegal for local law enforcement to “materially limit” the enforcement of immigration laws. 
The law would have also prohibited local police from failing to comply with requests by federal agents to detain illegal immigrants based on their immigration status. The blocked parts of the law would have gone into effect on Sept. 1. 
Under the law, authorities who don’t help federal agents deport illegal immigrants could be fined up to $25,500 per day. The law also says local law enforcement officials who do not comply with parts of the law could also lose their jobs and be charged with misdemeanor violations carrying sentences of  up to one year in jail.
One section of the law that was not blocked allows police to ask people about their immigration status. Given the ruling, police are not able to do more than report an undocumented immigrant’s status to federal agents, provided they are not suspected of criminal activity.
Texas is estimated to have 1.6 million illegal immigrants.

43180,2017-09-06,Possible Intermediate-Mass Black Hole discovered near center of Milky Way,"Scientists have published a study indicating the possible discovery of an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH) near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The study said it has an estimated mass of about 100,000 times that of the sun. 
IMBHs have been hypothesized, but not directly detected. If they exist, they may have implications for how supermassive black holes form. One possibility is that supermassive black holes, with masses millions or billions that of the sun, form by the coalescence of IMBHs.
Preliminary evidence of the IMBH, the second possible one discovered in the Milky Way, was derived from simulations of the measured motions of a molecular gas cloud near the center of the galaxy that suggested a nearby object with IMBH-level mass. Radio waves from the cloud showed similarities to those of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A, believed to be at the center of the Milky Way. The study was published in Nature Astronomy by a team led by Tomoharu Oka from Keio University in Japan.

The lawsuit argues that a repeal of DACA:

	Has a “discriminatory motive” against Mexicans
	Violates due process by being “fundamentally unfair”
	Violates laws that dictate procedures for federal regulations

The suit also argues that ending DACA would hurt states’ economies if young undocumented immigrants covered under DACA are deported.
The lawsuit was filed in New York’s Eastern District by New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The states challenging the decision are: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

43190,2017-09-07,"US imposes sanctions on South Sudanese officials, companies","The U.S. government announced on Wednesday that it was sanctioning six South Sudanese entities. The U.S. Treasury Department said the sanctions were in response to a “deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, and the role of certain officials in undermining stability and peace.”
The sanctions are against two officials, a former official, and companies owned by one of them. The measure freezes their assets located under U.S. jurisdiction, prohibits the individuals from traveling to the U.S., and bars American companies from doing business with them, AP reported. The Treasury Department also issued a notice that penalties may be imposed on banks doing business with South Sudanese officials and companies that are suspected of money laundering and corruption.
The sanctions apply to army Deputy Chief of Staff General Malek Reuben Riak Rengu, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth and former Chief of Staff of the South Sudan People’s Liberation Army Paul Malong Awan. Three companies owned by General Reuben were also sanctioned.

43193,2017-09-07,Study finds microscopic plastic fibers in 83% of drinking water samples,"Microscopic plastic fibers have been found in 83 percent of drinking water samples, according to a new study carried out in the U.S. by Orb Media. Scientists from the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health analyzed 159 water samples from all over the world. The contamination levels range from 94 percent in the U.S. and Lebanon to 72 percent in the U.K., Germany and France. The average number of fibers found in a 500 ml sample varied from 4.8 in the U.S. to 1.9 in Europe.
Orb Media reports that the plastic fibers can enter the water supply from a variety of sources, such as synthetic fibers from laundered clothing, tire dust, paint dust, plastic microbeads in cosmetics and toothpaste, and larger pieces of plastic that have been fragmented.
Previous studies of plastic in the environment have mainly focused on its effects on marine life. Potential effects on human health have yet to be investigated. The study also found plastic fibers in samples of commercially bottled water.

43210,2017-09-11,Former Georgian President Saakashvili returns to Ukraine,"Mikheil Saakashvili, former President of Georgia and a former governor of a Ukrainian region, returned to Ukraine on Sunday, reportedly in an attempt to challenge the decision to rescind his Ukrainian citizenship. 
Earlier on Sunday, Saakashvili had boarded a train in Poland heading for Ukraine, before the train was stopped by guards before the Ukrainian border. Reports differ regarding how Saakashvili entered the country. Some media reported that he and his supporters broke through a line of border guards to force entry into the country. Ukrainian Member of Parliament Ivan Krulko, cited by BBC, said the guards had allowed Saakashvili into the country. 
Saakashvili was born in Georgia and was president of the country from 2004 to 2013. He left Georgia for Ukraine in 2015 and was appointed governor of the Odessa region by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. He also accepted Ukrainian citizenship, and in the process renounced his Georgian citizenship. Saakashvili resigned in November 2016, over a disagreement with Poroshenko, BBC and AFP reported. Ukraine rescinded Saakashvili’s citizenship in July of this year, while he was out of the country, making him stateless.
On Tuesday, the Georgian government requested that Ukraine extradite Saakashvili on charges of misappropriation of property and abuse of office. Saakashvili has denied the charges, and says they are politically motivated.

43222,2017-09-12,UN Security Council passes new sanctions on North Korea following its sixth nuclear test,"The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Monday to pass new sanctions on North Korea following its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3. The sanctions include stopping natural gas shipments to North Korea, banning North Korea’s textile exports, and limiting deliveries of refined oil products to half a million barrels from Oct. 1 to Jan. 1, 2018 and to two million barrels in 2018. That would effectively reduce refined oil product imports by North Korea by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Other provisions under the U.N. resolution include:

	Limiting crude oil exports to North Korea to not exceed their current levels.
	U.N. member countries are to inspect ships arriving at and leaving from North Korean ports (as per a 2009 Security Council resolution), provided the countries where the ships are registered agree.
	U.N. member countries may not grant new work permits to North Korean laborers unless they are for humanitarian reasons or denuclearization. Countries must report on the end dates for current work permits of the approximately 93,000 North Koreans who work outside of their country. 

This was the eighth set of sanctions on North Korea passed by the U.N. since North Korea’s first nuclear tests in 2006.

43225,2017-09-12,US Supreme Court allows for at least temporary enforcement of part of Trump’s ‘travel ban’,"On Monday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ruled to allow enforcement of a portion of President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, the so-called “travel ban,” until at least Tuesday. The decision suspends a federal appeals court ruling that would have allowed refugees who had formal assurances from resettlement agencies to enter the United States. 
Justice Kennedy set Tuesday at noon as the deadline for a response from the suing parties to be considered by the Supreme Court for further ruling. He said his decision would stand “pending receipt” of their response. 
In June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had ruled that refugees who were grandparents of American residents or who had formal assurances would be allowed to enter the U.S. That ruling was scheduled to go into effect as of this Tuesday. 
The Department of Justice’s Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall brought the emergency request to the Supreme Court, requesting the court suspend the allowance of entry to refugees with formal assurances. The decision is estimated to affect approximately 24,000 refugees.
The Knife reported in June on the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling on Trump’s executive order.

China informed the World Trade Organization in July that it was planning to prohibit imports that include certain types of scrap metal including aluminum, as well as plastics and unsorted waste paper. 
China wants to reduce its need to dispose of impurities in the scrap, such as certain plastics in aluminum scrap from automobiles, that arrives from the U.S., Nikkei Asian Review reported. The government also cited pollution issues as the rationale for the ban.

The ban could affect 20 percent of U.S. trade to China, the U.S. Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) estimates. The U.S. exports about $5 billion of waste and scrap material to China, which is the sixth-largest category of exports from the U.S. to China. ISRI said it plans to contest the ban. CNN did not report details on how it would do so.

According to AFP, Macron’s reforms are aimed at lowering France’s 9.5 unemployment rate and include giving bosses of “small” companies greater freedom to negotiate work conditions directly with employees, rather than be subject to industry agreements. They would also limit compensation for employees who are unfairly dismissed, and would make it easier for foreign-based companies to fire people in France. The reforms were passed by decree and may be implemented in September. Macron’s party holds a majority in parliament, which could ratify the reforms later.

	55 percent of people surveyed said they were “willing to share some information about myself with companies in order to use online services for free,” according to a 2014 Pew Research Center study.
	33 percent of people surveyed said they were aware they could read online privacy policies, and 16 percent said they had done this, according to a 2016 TRUSTe/National Cyber Security Alliance study.

If you want to protect your data, Consumer Reports provides the following tips to secure your information:

	Don’t give out your social security number to unknown people or organizations who ask for it via phone, email or other correspondences.
	Don’t carry your Social Security card with you.
	Don't write your Social Security number on checks.
	Store financial account statements, medical records, and tax filings in a secure place.
	Don't post your birthdate, mother's maiden name, first pet's name, or other personal information on social media sites. That type of information may be used for verification purposes or security questions.
	If available, sign up for any mobile alert features your bank or credit card offers, which can inform you of any suspicious activity, allowing you to act and contest the issue as it happens.
	Freeze access to your credit report from credit bureaus such as Equifax (depending on the credit agency, this may cost various fees) to prevent someone from opening any new lines of credit in your name. Once this is done, only financial institutions that you already have a relationship with, such as your mortgage company, can access the report information. You must request a freeze from each reporting bureau individually.

	As noted by Forbes contributor Marc Weber Tobias, unfreezing your account may take several days and have associated fees, which may need to be taken into consideration if you need to take out a line of credit, for example.


	A 90-day fraud alert can be placed on accounts that you suspect have been compromised or illegally accessed.
	Use strong passwords, as outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (see Appendix A) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. According to the aforementioned Pew Research survey, 25 percent of respondents said they use passwords that are “less secure than they’d like” because they’re easier to remember.

	Fun fact: avoid using the password “Trustno1.” Formerly used by Fox Mulder in the TV show X-Files, it is now considered to be one of the 25 most popular passwords, according to a report from the password management service SplashData.


	Monitor your financial account activity on a regular basis. This may involve seeking out credit reports maintained by companies such as Equifax, and keeping records of your own financial transactions, as well as those you suspect are the result of fraud.
	Stop unwanted credit card requests. If you receive a credit card application in the mail, people may steal these forms and fill them out without your knowledge. Consumer Reports says you can stop credit bureaus from selling your name to lenders by going to optoutprescreen.com or calling 888-567-8688. The website lets you opt out for five years or life.

If you suspect you are being affected by identity theft, Consumer Reports recommends a number of steps, including letting your financial institutions know as soon as possible, closing compromised accounts and using the freezing and fraud alert tools previously noted.
Information on credit bureaus
Credit bureaus collect information such as a person’s bill payment and borrowing history in order to calculate a credit score. Credit scores are used by lenders, insurers and employers to assess how people handle financial responsibilities. For example, a bank may use your credit score to decide whether to give you a loan and what interest rate you will pay on it. Other information collected includes Social Security numbers, address history and birthdays.
Credit bureaus get their information from banks, credit card issuers and other creditors. They also collect public information such as court or property records.
There are three main credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, though there are other credit reporting companies, such as Payment Reporting Builds Credit (PRBC), Clarity Services Inc. and DataX.

43291,2017-09-18,California lawmakers approve ‘sanctuary state’ bill,"On Saturday, California’s Senate approved the California Values Act (Bill SB-54), a so-called “state sanctuary” bill. If signed by California Governor Jerry Brown, who has previously announced his support for the legislation, it would ban state and local law enforcement officials from providing information to, or acting as deputies for, federal immigration authorities. It would also ban them from inquiring about a person’s immigration status.
The bill was adopted with support from Democratic lawmakers, and Republican lawmakers voted against it, according to The Associated Press. Local law enforcement officials, including police, sheriff’s deputies and jail corrections officers would still be able to collaborate with federal immigration authorities if a person has been convicted of a crime included in a list of about 800 crimes. 
An estimated 2.3 million undocumented immigrants live in California.

The SDF issued a statement claiming Russia was responsible for the attack. On Sunday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov denied the allegations, saying Russia had only performed strikes targeting IS militants.
Backed by the U.S. government, the SDF is a coalition of Arab and Kurdish groups fighting against IS and the Syrian government. Both the SDF and Syrian government troops, supported by Russia, are currently involved in fighting IS in and around Deir el-Zour. IS first took control of the provincial capital in 2014. On Sep. 5, the Syrian government announced it had taken back control of about 40 percent of the city from IS.

43297,2017-09-18,St. Louis protests continue Saturday after police officer’s acquittal in shooting case,"At least nine people were arrested Saturday night in the St. Louis suburb of University City. The arrests took place during a second night of protests of the Friday acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. The protesters reportedly broke shop windows and threw objects at the police. 
On Friday night, at least 23 people were arrested, 11 police officers were injured and 10 shops damaged. Missouri Governor Eric Greitens said the National Guard had been activated to protect residents and property after the acquittal.
On Dec. 20, 2011, Stockley and his partner were attempting to arrest Smith over a suspected drug transaction. The officers chased Smith, and Stockley said he shot him in self-defense when Smith allegedly reached for a gun in his car. Stockley pleaded not guilty to a murder charge and waived his right to a jury trial. St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson said in his ruling that the state had failed to prove Stockley did not act in self-defense.
In 2013, the same year Stockley left the force, St. Louis police settled a wrongful death suit for $900,000 with Smith’s family.

Hamas said it was willing to hold new elections and invite Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ government to return to Gaza. The move came after talks that were mediated by the Egyptian government last week in Cairo.
Hamas has held control over Gaza since a 2006 election led to a split of the Palestinian Authority after a short civil war the following year. Since the conflict, Hamas has had control of the Gaza Strip and Abbas’ government has had control of the West Bank. Several attempts at reconciliation since then have failed. Abbas said he welcomed the decision and would convene the Palestinian leadership for talks.

The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) planned the referendum, saying it would not result in immediate independence from Iraq if a majority voted ""yes."" The KRG said a “yes” vote would lead to “serious discussions” with Iraq’s national government.
Iraq, the U.S. and Turkey, among other countries, have expressed opposition to the referendum.
After the Gulf War in 1992, Iraqi Kurds created a regional government in the northern part of the country. Iraq gave some autonomy to the Kurdish region, also known as Iraqi Kurdistan, while maintaining it as part of the Iraqi state, after a U.S.-led coalition removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003.

43312,2017-09-19,US Senate considers bill to repeal Affordable Care Act,"Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) introduced a bill last week that would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as “Obamacare.” The bill would reduce Medicaid spending and give states a per-beneficiary amount of federal money instead. 
Unlike previous repeal bills, this one would provide block grants to states from 2020 until 2026 that would give them more flexibility in how to use federal money. It would also give states the option to apply for federal waivers allowing insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. According to Cassidy, states applying for waivers would have to demonstrate how they would “maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.”
Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate and currently need 50 votes to pass legislation, with Vice President Mike Pence providing a 51st vote in the case of a tie. After Sept. 30, they would need 60 votes to pass the legislation. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said he will vote against the bill. Susan Collins (R.-Me.) and Lisa Murkowski (R.-Ak.), two Republican senators who voted “no” in July to a different version of an ACA repeal bill, have not indicated how they would vote. 
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R.-Ky.) has called for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to expedite its analysis of the bill, which would include estimates of how many people would have Medicaid under the bill.

43315,2017-09-20,Riot follows vigil at Georgia Tech; 3 arrested,"On Monday night, a riot took place shortly after a vigil at Georgia Institute of Technology for Scout Schultz, a student who was shot and killed by police on Saturday. Two police officers received minor injuries and a police vehicle was damaged by fire. Three people were arrested and charged with inciting a riot and battery of an officer.
The vigil, which was attended by around 500 people, according to Georgia Tech President G.P. Peterson, ended peacefully. Around 20 minutes later, some 50 people marched towards the campus police station chanting slogans, setting off fireworks and confronting members of the police.
Scout Schultz, 21, was a fourth-year engineering student and a leader of a LGBTQ advocacy group. On Saturday night, campus police responded to a 911 call reporting a suspicious person with a knife, and possibly a gun. Schultz was confronted and shot when he stepped towards campus police, instead of relinquishing his weapon as requested. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Schultz himself had placed the 911 call, that no gun had been found on the scene, and that investigators had found three suicide notes in his room.

This amount is scheduled to increase every three months, until it reaches $30 million and $20 million, respectively. No end date for the reduction has been given.
The U.S. economy grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the first half of 2017. The Fed increased its median estimate for economic growth over the entire year from 2.2 to 2.4 percent.

Mount Agung is 9,944 feet high and located 45 miles northeast of the Kuta Beach tourist resort. It last erupted in 1963, killing 1,100 people. Indonesia is located on the so-called Pacific “ring-of-fire” and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Authorities have said there is currently no danger to people in other areas of the island, according to The Associated Press.

43364,2017-09-25,Iran tests new ballistic missile,"Iran tested a new ballistic missile on Friday after it was presented at a military parade in Tehran the same day. The missile, called Khorramshahr, reportedly has a range of 1,200 miles and is capable of carrying multiple warheads, according to Iranian broadcaster Press TV. The broadcaster did not report when or from where the missile was launched.
The U.S. says the Iranian missile test violates a 2015 agreement between Iran and six other countries, including the U.S. and Russia, an Iranian ally. Under the agreement, Iran agrees to restrict its nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions being lifted. Iran denies that its missiles are designed to carry nuclear warheads, and President Rouhani said Friday that Iran remains “fully committed” to the agreement, according to Press TV.

43367,2017-09-26,Japanese Prime Minister Abe to order snap election of lower house,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Monday that he would dissolve the lower house of parliament this Thursday and call a snap election for Oct. 22, more than a year ahead of scheduled elections. 
The vote would act as a gauge of how voters viewed his policies of using revenue from a planned tax increase to fund social programs, and of his “firm stance” of “maximizing pressure” on North Korean missiles and nuclear tests, Abe said at a Monday news conference. He announced that if his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) party does not win another majority in the election, he will resign as prime minister. 
The upcoming consumption tax increase from eight to ten percent, planned for October 2019, is expected to yield five trillion yen in increased revenue, the Japan Times reports. Japan had originally planned to use four trillion of that amount to pay off its debt, which is the highest among developed countries relative to gross domestic product (GDP). Instead, Abe plans to redirect about two trillion yen of the new tax revenue to social programs in order to address what he calls “major issues facing the working population,” such as child care, education and social security.

This version would increase state block grants (which are designed to give states flexibility in federal spending) by a total of $14.5 billion. The draft would also allow states to raise limits on out-of-pocket costs for the insured, and to remove federal approval requirements for states to allow higher premiums for older people and those with pre-existing conditions.
The Congressional Budget Office said it will issue a report by Sunday on the new bill’s financial impact on the deficit, adding that it would not have time to analyze the effect on coverage and premiums.

43373,2017-09-26,Residents of Kurdish region of Iraq vote on independence,"Iraqis in Kurdish areas voted on Monday in a non-binding referendum on independence from the country. About 5.2 million people, both Kurds and non-Kurds, in three Kurdish provinces and some Kurdish-Iraqi disputed areas were eligible to vote. Turnout was 78 percent. The final results are scheduled to be announced by 6 p.m. local time on Thursday. 
The ballot contained one question in Kurdish, Arabic, Assyrian, and Turkish: “Do you want the Kurdistan Region and Kurdistani areas outside the (Kurdistan) Region to become an independent country?” Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani has said that if the majority of the votes were “yes,” he would start negotiations with Iraqi officials on possible independence. 
In Kirkuk, Arabs and Turks called for a boycott of the vote. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had called the vote “unconstitutional,” and last week the Supreme Court ruled that the vote should be suspended until its constitutionality could be determined. The U.S., Turkey and other countries have opposed the vote.

Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) report said. 
The report also cited “intrusive law enforcement raids of private properties” that “interfered with [the] right to privacy.”
Russia imposed citizenship on Ukrainians in the Crimean peninsula after it occupied the territory in March 2014. According to the U.N. report, those actions as well as replacing Ukrainian laws with Russian laws were both violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws. Hundreds of prisoners in Crimean jails were also illegally transferred to Russian jails, the U.N. reported. 
The report provides 20 recommendations to the Russian government for addressing the situation, including investigating allegations of torture, abductions and killings involving security forces in Crimea.

18317,2017-10-02,"Shooter kills 58, injures at least 515 at Las Vegas music festival","A man identified by police as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock fired shots at the crowd of an outdoor concert in Las Vegas on Sunday night, killing 58 people and injuring at least 515, according to Las Vegas Police. He had been situated on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. A SWAT team found Paddock dead in his hotel room after the shooting. Police said they believed he killed himself.
The Islamic State group claimed Paddock had converted to Islam months ago and that it was behind the attack. The FBI said no connection had been established between the shooter and any terrorist group.
The shooting was first reported at 10:08 p.m. local time, and police reported one suspect dead a little before midnight. Ten guns, including rifles, were found in the hotel room with Paddock.
Paddock, an accountant from Mesquite, Nevada, had checked into the Mandalay Bay hotel on Thursday, according to police, who gave no motive for the shooting. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said they were looking for a “companion” of Paddock. Later, police said they were “confident” they had located this person, Marilou Danley.
The New York Times reports that a video the outlet had obtained showed gunfire, whose sound resembled an automatic weapon, occurring for about nine seconds, then a pause with no shooting for 37 seconds, and then two more periods of gunfire of less than nine seconds each. CNN reports that witnesses said the shooting lasted for 10 to 15 minutes in total.
A mile-long section of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed after the shooting. Interstate 15 was also closed for a time. Some flights to McCarran International Airport were diverted. The airport is adjacent to the concert grounds, and concert-goers were reported to have been on an airport runway after the shooting.
At least 22,000 people attended the three-day, country music Route 91 Harvest Festival. The shooting began during the performance of Jason Aldean, the festival’s last act. Sunday’s casualties represent the largest number of people killed in a shooting in the U.S. since 1949. Last year’s shooting in an Orlando night club killed 49 people.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he will visit first responders and families of the victims in Las Vegas on Wednesday. He ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff until sunset Friday.

43421,2017-10-02,2 attacks in Edmonton investigated as acts of terrorism,"Canadian police are investigating two attacks that occurred Saturday night in Edmonton, Alberta, as acts of terrorism, according to Edmonton Police Chief Rod Knecht. A 30-year-old suspect is in custody. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the suspect was on a “police watch list,” and Knecht said police believe he acted alone. Goodale added that Canada’s National Terrorism Threat Level for Canada remains at “medium,” where it has been since the fall of 2014.
The first incident happened at 8:15 p.m. local time, when a Chevrolet truck drove into a traffic barricade, striking a police officer and then crashing into the officer’s vehicle. The driver jumped out of his vehicle and stabbed the officer “several” times before leaving the scene on foot. Police found and confiscated an Islamic State flag in the truck. The officer is hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.
Around midnight, a U-Haul truck was stopped at a police check-point. Officers recognized the driver’s name as similar to the Chevrolet's registered owner. The U-Haul sped off from the check-point, attempting to hit pedestrians as it went, Knecht said at a press conference. The police chase ended when the truck flipped and landed on its side. Four pedestrians were injured; two have been discharged from the hospital, while two are under observation.

A complete ban on abortion was lifted in 2013. Current legislation allows abortion only in cases where the mother’s life is in danger. Last month, after a citizens panel recommended that the eighth amendment be changed, Ireland’s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced that a referendum would be held on the issue in May or June next year. A parliamentary group has been set up to decide exactly what question to ask in the vote.
More than 3,000 Irish women traveled to England in 2016 to obtain an abortion, according to the British Department of Health.

A counter-demonstration was also organized. Participants in this protest threw fireworks, stones and bottles at the police, according to a police spokesperson. Counter-protesters tried breaking through police lines, allegedly to confront NMR protesters. The NMR protest was brought to an end when police circled its members to keep them apart from counter-protesters. Police had anticipated possible problems and called for reinforcements from other police districts.

43432,2017-10-03,"SCOTUS agenda to include redistricting, anti-discrimination, cell phone privacy","The U.S. Supreme Court was back in session on Monday, with an agenda that includes cases on immigration, anti-discrimination, gambling, employee rights, cell phone privacy, voting and redistricting, and possibly the travel ban.
Justice Neil Gorsuch is now on the court, bringing the number of justices back to nine after Justice Antonin Scalia passed away last year.
Agenda highlights

	Anti-discrimination: a Colorado baker argues that, due to his religious beliefs, he shouldn’t have to make cakes for same-sex marriage couples, while a Colorado law forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation.
	Cell phone privacy: a Michigan man convicted of robbery argues that police should not have been able to access cell phone records without a search warrant; the records showed him to be near crime scenes at the times of robberies.

43438,2017-10-03,Marseille knife attacker released by police a day before stabbings,"French officials said Monday that a man who fatally stabbed two women on Sunday outside Marseille’s Saint Charles train station had been released by police in Lyon the day before, after allegedly shoplifting. He had used different fake identities in each of seven past encounters with police. When arrested on Friday, he carried a Tunisian passport in the name of Ahmed H., aged 29. He was released Saturday due to lack of evidence.
Surveillance cameras showed the man stabbing one woman multiple times, moving away, and coming back to stab the second woman. The man was shot dead by French soldiers after the stabbings. Witnesses said the man shouted “Allahu Akbar” before the attack, which means “God is Greatest” in Arabic. 
The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack through its Aamaq news agency, saying the man was responding to its calls to attack people in countries such as France that support the U.S.-led coalition in Syria and Iraq. Paris public prosecutor, Francois Molins, did not confirm or deny the claim.
One of the victims was a medical student from Eguilles, France, and the other was her cousin. Both were 20 years old.

43441,2017-10-04,15 Cuban diplomats asked to leave embassy in Washington,"The U.S. Department of State asked Cuba to withdraw 15 diplomats from its embassy in Washington on Tuesday. They have seven days to leave, according to BBC. U.S. officials said the request was made to ensure there were similar numbers of diplomats at each country’s embassies; last Friday, the U.S. recalled 60 percent of about 50 staff members from its embassy in Havana. The withdrawal happened due to concerns over a number of unexplained health issues experienced by the Havana embassy staff.
Since late 2016, a number of U.S. embassy staff in Havana have reported hearing loss, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, cognitive issues and difficulty sleeping. Twenty-one diplomats and family members have been affected. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement the U.S. was investigating the cause of the health issues and would maintain diplomatic ties with Cuba. Cuba has denied involvement in the incidents.
On Friday, the State Department also issued a travel warning, saying U.S. citizens may be at risk if they travel to Cuba.

43447,2017-10-04,3 US scientists win Nobel Prize in physics for work on gravitational waves,"On Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne have won the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics for their work on gravitational waves and building an observatory to measure them. The prize comes with a 9 million Swedish Krona cash reward (approximately $1.1 million). Half of the prize money will go to Weiss, and the other half will be shared between Barish and Thorne.
Gravitational waves, first theorized by Albert Einstein in 1916, have been described as “ripples in the fabric of space-time,” and they happen when black holes merge. Weiss, 85, and Thorne, 77, proposed building a facility to measure these waves in the 1980s. Barish joined them in the 1990s. They built a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) that can detect gravitational waves with laser beams. In 2015, they successfully detected waves from the collision and merging of two black holes, each about 30 times the mass of the sun.

Huntsman, whose nomination was confirmed by the Senate last week, arrived in Moscow on Monday. He took over the role from John Tefft.
Huntsman, 57, attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor’s degree in international politics in 1987. Prior to that, he worked as a White House staff assistant in 1983 and then as state director in Utah for the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984. In 1992, he was appointed ambassador to Singapore by then President George H.W. Bush. From 1993 to 2001, he worked at his father’s Huntsman Corporation, a chemicals manufacturer. In 2005, he returned to politics when he was elected governor of Utah, a position he held until 2009. From 2009 to 2011, he served as the U.S. ambassador to China during Barack Obama’s presidency.
In May 2011, Huntsman announced his plans to run for president of the U.S. as a Republican candidate. In January 2012, he withdrew from the race and endorsed Mitt Romney instead.

43453,2017-10-05,US House of Representatives passes bill banning abortion after 20 weeks,"On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Bill HR36, also called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, is sponsored by Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and passed the chamber 237-189.
HR36 would make it a crime to perform, or attempt to perform, abortions after 20 weeks, except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother’s life were in danger. Proponents of the bill argue that a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks gestation. The bill would not seek to penalize the women seeking an abortion, only those performing them. The penalty for performing abortions could be a fine, up to five years in prison, or both. 
The Senate has not announced when it will debate the bill. The White House has announced it is in support of the bill. CNN reports that several states have enacted similar legislation, and that those who oppose the bill claim it is unconstitutional.

43456,2017-10-05,Scientists behind 3D imaging of molecules win Nobel Prize in Chemistry,"Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for their work on 3D imaging of biological molecules. The three have developed a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, which allows scientists to create accurate 3D images of molecules, like proteins and viral particles.
Cryo-electron microscopy can record images of molecules after freezing them, allowing researchers to study their normal, undamaged shape, which is something other imaging techniques cannot do. Knowing a molecule’s natural structure can give important information about its function and interactions. For example, the 3D structure of a virus could help scientists understand how it attacks and enters a cell. The new technique was used last year to analyze the structure of the Zika virus, which causes birth defects in humans.
Dubochet, 75, is from Switzerland and is honorary professor of biophysics at the University of Lausanne there. Frank, 77, is professor at Columbia University in New York; he was born in Germany and is now a U.S. citizen. Henderson, 72, is British and works at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. The three will share the 9 million Swedish Kronor award (approximately $1.1 million).

43459,2017-10-05,42 convicted for attempted assassination of Turkish president in 2016,"On Wednesday, a Turkish court convicted 42 people of attempting to assassinate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a failed attempt to overthrow the Turkish government in July 2016. Of the 47 defendants on trial, 42 were declared guilty. The majority of them are former Special Forces soldiers. Thirty-four were given “aggravated” life sentences, which is the longest sentence under Turkish law, as it lengthens the minimum time served before parole is considered. Of those remaining, six were given a life sentence and two were given shorter sentences.
Of the five who were not convicted, one had his case transferred to another court and one was acquitted. The other three were tried in absentia, and no sentences were issued. One of these was exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is based in the U.S. The Turkish government has said Gulen was behind the coup attempt last year.
More than 240 people were killed during the attempt to overthrow the government on July 15, 2016.

43465,2017-10-06,US NRA says bump stock devices ‘should be subject to additional regulations’,"The U.S. National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement on Thursday that it “believes devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” The statement said that in Sunday night’s Las Vegas mass shooting, “reports indicate that certain devices were used to modify the firearms involved,” and that the NRA “is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these [bump fire stock] devices comply with federal law.” 
The Las Vegas shooter reportedly had “bump stocks” attached to 12 rifles found in his hotel room. The devices attach to rifles and use the rifle’s recoiling action, causing the trigger to be pulled over and over again so that semi-automatic rifles can fire at a rate similar to automatic rifles. The ATF had previously declined to ban bump stocks, saying in 2010 that a bump stock is a “firearm part and is not regulated as a (actual) firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.”
“Banning guns from law-abiding Americans” would “do nothing to prevent future attacks,” the NRA said in Thursday’s statement. The statement also reaffirmed the NRA’s commitment to “strengthening” the Second Amendment of the U.S. constitution, which protects “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms.”

43470,2017-10-06,"3 US Green Berets killed, 2 wounded in attack in Niger","Three U.S. special operations soldiers were killed and two were wounded on Wednesday in Niger, according to U.S. officials who requested anonymity. A Nigerien official said five Nigerien soldiers were also killed in the operation. The U.S. and Nigerien soldiers were attacked while on a joint patrol along the Niger-Mali border. U.S. officials said they were likely attacked by militants from al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb.
French soldiers evacuated the dead and wounded via helicopter. According to a spokeswoman for the French Ministry of Defense, no French soldiers were killed in the attack. The two wounded American soldiers, also known as Green Berets, were taken to Niger’s capital Niamey, about 124 miles (200 km) away, before being transported to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where they were in stable condition, according to U.S. Africa Command.
CNN reports that the U.S. has about 800 troops in Niger, and has had a military presence there for five years. According to a spokesman for U.S. Africa Command, U.S. special forces “provide training and security assistance” to Nigerien forces in fighting “violent extremist organizations,” such as al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and IS-affiliated Boko Haram. France has maintained thousands of troops in the area since starting its “counterterrorism effort” Operation Barkhane in 2014.

43473,2017-10-06,US Attorney General memo: Title VII doesn’t cover gender identity-based discrimination,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote in a memo that the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s Title VII prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex “encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) memo, delivered to federal prosecutors on Wednesday, said the department would take this position “in all pending and future matters.” 
The statement, which Buzzfeed first reported on Thursday, further said the position was a “conclusion of law, not policy,” and that the DOJ, “must and will continue to affirm the dignity of all people, including transgender individuals.” 
Three years ago, the Justice Department under President Obama had implemented a policy that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to be used to bring legal claims on behalf of transgender people discriminated against in the workplace for their gender identity. There are currently no federal laws that explicitly prohibit discrimination against transgender people in the workplace.

Barcelona police estimated there were 350,000 protesters, and rally organizer Societat Civil Catalana estimated 930,000 attended. The region held a referendum on Oct. 1 on seceding from Spain. The Catalan government said about 90 percent of the 42 percent turnout voted in favor of secession, in the referendum deemed “illegal” by Spain’s constitutional court. 
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said that he would employ any measure “allowed by the law” to stop Catalan secession, including invoking Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which allows Spain to take control of regional governments that violate the constitution. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont plans to address the regional parliament on Tuesday “to report on the current political situation.” 
Demonstrations against Catalonia's secession were also held in Madrid on Saturday, BBC reported.

The state-run Anadolu news agency describes the arrested consulate employee as a male Turkish citizen.
“Recent events have forced the United States government to reassess the commitment of government of Turkey to the security of U.S. mission and personnel,” the embassy said in a statement. “In order to minimize the number of visitors to our embassy and consulates while this assessment proceeds, effective immediately we have suspended all non-immigrant visa services at all U.S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey.”

18582,2017-10-10,US and Turkey suspend nonimmigrant visa services,"On Sunday, the U.S. mission in Turkey suspended its nonimmigrant visa services in the country and, hours later, Turkey announced a reciprocal suspension. The U.S. measure was in response to the arrest of U.S. consulate staff member Metin Topuz last week. Topuz, a Turkish national, was arrested and charged with espionage, trying to overthrow Turkey’s government and acting against the Turkish Constitution. Turkey believes Topuz has links to Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating a failed military coup in July 2016. 
In a statement, U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass announced the suspension and said, “we have been unable to determine … what if any, evidence exists against [Topuz].” He added, “we don’t know … if we should expect other Turkish staff members to be arrested for simply speaking to Turkish government officials or the wider Turkish public in the course of their duties.”
The visa suspensions affect students, business travellers, tourists and diplomats, among others. According to a U.S. official, all current visas remain valid and, while visa services in Turkey are suspended, Turkish citizens can still apply for U.S. visas in other countries. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said its suspension included electronic visas and those purchased at the border. The suspension does not appear to be enforced yet at Turkey’s borders, according to The New York Times.
On Monday, Turkey’s state-run news outlet Anadolu Agency said Turkey’s Foreign Ministry had summoned the U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Philip Kosnett, the top U.S. official currently physically present in Turkey, and asked for the U.S. embassy to reverse the suspension. 
Recent disputes
The U.S. and Turkey currently disagree on other issues, including:

	The attempted military coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government in July 2016. Turkey holds Gulen responsible for orchestrating the failed coup. The U.S. has refused to extradite him, with U.S. officials saying the evidence against Gulen is insufficient.
	The war in Syria. The U.S. is allied with the Syrian Kurds against the Islamic State group. Turkey objects to this alliance because the Syrian Kurds are connected to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkey. Both the U.S. and Turkey deem the PKK a “terrorist organization.”

The U.S. State Department has also been critical of Erdoğan’s government, citing human rights violations and irregularities in the referendum to amend the Turkish Constitution earlier this year. The State Department also cited “troubling judicial and law enforcement actions” by the Turkish government after it raided the offices of newspapers like Zaman last year and placed them under state control. President Barack Obama, as well as other world leaders, also reportedly expressed concerns about the treatment of more than 6,000 Turkish soldiers arrested in July 2016 on suspicion of plotting the attempted coup.",Immigration|Politics|The Facts|War and Conflict,Middle East|United States,visa suspensions,,Turkey,arrests|diplomacy|nonimmigrant visas|reciprocity|tourism|travel,world_news,publish
43488,2017-10-10,Iran Revolutionary Guard commander comments on potential US actions on Iran deal,"According to state media on Monday, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said the Trump administration’s possible “behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by [Iran] as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program.” The White House had announced Friday that Trump would present new U.S. responses to Iran regarding its missile tests, cyber operations and support for “terrorism.”
Oct. 15, 2017 is Trump’s deadline to certify to Congress whether Iran is complying with the so-called “nuclear deal,” a six-nation, 2015 agreement for Iran to limit its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of sanctions against the country. Trump has not yet said whether he would certify Iran’s compliance. If he does not, Congress must decide within 60 days whether to reinstate sanctions lifted under the program.
Jafari also said, “If reports on the US decision to enlist Iran’s IRGC as a terrorist group ... [are] true, the Iranian force would ... treat the American Army ... in the same way as Daesh (IS) terrorists.” He added that if the U.S. passes new sanctions, then it must move its regional bases outside the “2,000 km (1,242 mile) range of Iran’s missiles.” 
According to Reuters, the IRGC as a whole is not sanctioned by the U.S.; the Quds Force, a wing of the IRGC, and individuals and entities associated with IRGC are currently on a U.S. list of terrorist organizations.

43493,2017-10-10,Pruitt: EPA to begin withdrawal from Clean Power Plan,"On Monday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chief Scott Pruitt said he would sign a proposal Tuesday “to withdraw the so-called Clean Power Plan of the past administration, and thus begin the effort to withdraw that rule.” The Clean Power Plan of 2015 regulates carbon emissions based on energy consumption by state, and provides incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
A draft of the proposal says the EPA overstepped its authority when it issued the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions, and that the EPA will in the future seek public input on the best ways to cut emissions from power plants that burn natural gas and coal. According to The Washington Post, the draft does not present a replacement plan for reducing carbon emissions, something the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the EPA must do. 
Last year, 28 states and other plaintiffs challenged the regulation’s legality, and the Supreme Court blocked its implementation in a 5-to-4 decision. Neither the Supreme Court nor the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which heard oral arguments for the case, addressed the merits of the lawsuit then. In March, Trump signed an executive order that initiated a review of the Clean Power Plan.

White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short said in a call with reporters Sunday evening, “We’re asking that these reforms be included in any legislation concerning the status of DACA recipients.” 
Among other things covered in its 18 subheadings, Trump’s letter proposes funding and completing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, blocking or restricting grants to so-called “sanctuary cities,” limiting “family-based green cards” and implementing a “merit-based system” for applicants to earn them.
Last month, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Department of Homeland Security’s DACA program was “being rescinded.” Current recipients whose permits do not expire before Mar. 5, 2018 can legally work until then, while workers whose permits expire prior to Mar. 5, 2018 can apply by Oct. 5, 2017 for a two-year renewal.

43499,2017-10-10,Richard Thaler wins Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences,"Richard H. Thaler, 72, of the University of Chicago won the 2017 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Monday. Thaler won the award for his work on behavioral economics. The Nobel committee said his work has provided a “more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions.” 
Thaler co-authored the 2008 book “Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness” with Cass Sunstein, a Harvard law professor. According to The Guardian, “nudge” theory is based on behavioral economics, which involves how “gut instincts,” in addition to rational thought, can play a role in people’s economic choices. According to The New York Times, Thaler’s work formed the basis for the creation of behavioral economics divisions in the U.K., the U.S. and other countries.
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not one of the original prizes proposed by Alfred Nobel; it was started in 1968 by a Swedish bank, Sveriges Riksbank. The full name of the award is the 2017 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, and it awards a 9 million krona ($1.1 million US) monetary prize.

43502,2017-10-11,South Korea says military documents stolen in data breach,"On Tuesday, South Korean lawmaker Rhee Cheol-hee alleged North Korean hackers had stolen about 235 gigabytes of classified military documents from South Korea, in a hack carried out in September 2016. North Korea has denied the claim it was behind the breach. Rhee told news outlets the documents were stolen from the South Korean Defense Integrated Data Center and contained, among other documents, a U.S.-South Korean wartime operational plan known as OPLAN 5015. Rhee said the content of 80 percent of the stolen documents had yet to be identified.
Apart from OPLAN 5015, the documents also contained contingency plans for South Korea’s special forces, reports to senior commanders and information on South Korean military installations and power plants, according to Rhee, who sits on the South Korean parliament’s defense committee.
In May, South Korea’s Defense Ministry announced data had been stolen last year and North Korea may have been behind it. The ministry did not say which documents, or how much data had been stolen. The ministry has yet to comment on Rhee’s claim that North Korea is responsible.

In a speech to Catalonia’s regional parliament in Barcelona, Puigdemont said, “I assume the mandate that Catalonia should become an independent state in the form of a republic ... I propose suspending the effects of the declaration of independence to undertake talks to reach an agreed solution.”
A Catalan government spokesperson said 2.2 million of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters (42 percent) cast ballots in last Sunday’s referendum, with about 90 percent of votes in favor of independence from Spain. During the vote, over 900 people were injured when police attempted to stop it from going ahead.

43511,2017-10-11,Police say Las Vegas gunman shot security guard about 6 minutes before firing into crowd,"At a news conference on Monday, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police had revised the timeline of last Sunday’s shooting in Las Vegas. Police have now determined that security guard Jesus Campos was shot by Stephen Paddock at 9:59 p.m. local time last Sunday, about six minutes before Paddock started firing into a crowd of concert-goers.
Lombardo told the media that police don’t know what caused Paddock to stop firing into the crowd, or what his motives were. He also said there’s no evidence to date of a second shooter.
Campos was investigating an alarm from another room on the floor Paddock was on when he heard a drilling noise from Paddock’s room. He was then shot through the door. Lombardo said Campos, upon being shot, alerted hotel security and this helped police determine the location of the shooter. When police entered Paddock’s room at 11:20 p.m. he had killed himself.

43514,2017-10-12,Madrid issues ultimatum to Catalonia government on independence declaration,"On Wednesday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he had asked Catalonia’s regional government to clarify whether it had officially declared independence, giving it five days to reply. If the reply is “yes,” then Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont will have until Thursday, Oct. 19, to withdraw the declaration. If the Catalan government does not comply, Madrid will invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, Rajoy announced. Article 155 would suspend the region’s autonomy and place it under direct rule from Madrid.
Rajoy added that he was willing to negotiate regional autonomy and possible changes to the Spanish Constitution within the framework of existing laws. Catalan government spokesperson Jordi Turull said the Catalan government has “given up absolutely nothing … We have taken a time out,” following the signing of the declaration of independence Tuesday.
Catalonia represents 16 percent of Spain’s population and nearly a fifth of its GDP, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Court spokesperson Abdulstar Bayraqdar said the warrants were the result of a lawsuit filed by Iraq’s National Security Council. The suit argued the referendum went against a federal high court decision.
Ninety-two percent of the Kurds who voted in the non-binding referendum were in favor of independence. The Kurdistan region’s government did not declare independence after the vote. 
The Kurds acquired autonomy from Iraq in 1991, but have never had their own state. Kurds make up around 15 to 20 percent of Iraq’s population of 37 million.

43523,2017-10-12,Thailand to hold general election in 2018,"On Tuesday, Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters in Bangkok that the country would hold a general election in November 2018. The exact date would be announced in June next year, he added. Thailand has been under military rule since 2014, when Prayuth, former Commander in Chief of the Royal Thai Army, took power from the government of then Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The commander initially announced an election for 2015, but later postponed it.
In April, Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn signed a new constitution, which would introduce a proportional voting system. In such a system, parliamentary seats are allocated by the percentage of votes, meaning, the number of seats a party wins is proportional to the percentage of votes it garners. 
The April constitution gives authorities 240 days to write 10 new bills, of which four must be enacted before an election can be held. These are bills concerning the Election Commission, political parties, the election of lawmakers and the acquisition of senators. The first two have been approved by Thailand’s National Legislative Assembly and have been sent to the king for endorsement. Once the four bills have been adopted, an election will be held within 150 days, according to Section 268 of the new constitution.

43526,2017-10-13,US and Israel to withdraw from UNESCO,"On Thursday, the White House announced the U.S. was withdrawing from UNESCO, the U.N.’s cultural and educational body, citing “anti-Israel bias” as the reason. A few hours later, Israel also announced its withdrawal. Israel has previously protested against the adoption of a UNESCO resolution referring to the Temple Mount complex in Jerusalem by its Palestinian name (Haram al-Sharif), while making no references to Jewish ties to the complex. The U.S. withdrawal is scheduled to come into effect on Dec. 31, 2018, and the State Department said the country would seek permanent observer status instead.
The U.S. stopped providing funding to UNESCO in 2011, when the organization accepted Palestine as a member state, and now owes about $550 million in back payments, The Associated Press reported. Since it stopped payment, the U.S. has still maintained an office at the Paris-based organization. The U.S. has withdrawn from UNESCO once before, in 1984, stating the agency was “politicized” and spent too much. The country re-joined in 2003.
UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) was founded in 1945. Its aim is to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among the nations through education, science and culture, as well as selecting World Heritage sites.

43533,2017-10-13,Trump signs executive order on ACA insurance rules,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that prioritizes changes to three areas of the Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The order aims to expand access to association health plans (AHPs), expand the maximum time limit of short-term insurance plans (STLDI), and expand health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). 
The executive order, titled “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,” says Trump’s administration will “prioritize” the three areas “for improvement in the near term.” The order does not implement immediate changes, but rather calls on federal agencies, like the Departments of Labor and Treasury, to propose regulations or revise guidance “consistent with law” within 60 days. 
The order states that expanding access to association health plans will make it easier for small businesses to join together in groups, allowing them to negotiate cheaper health plans for their employees. The document calls for increasing the maximum time limit for short-term insurance plans from three months to one year. Short-term plans are not required to comply with the ACA rules about protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Health reimbursement arrangements allow employers to give employees money to buy their own coverage.

43536,2017-10-13,Kenya bans protests in 3 cities,"Kenya’s government issued an order on Thursday to ban protests in the cities of Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i said the ban was meant to protect the safety of Kenyans, their businesses and property. Kenya’s opposition has held several protests since the Supreme Court annulled the result of the Aug. 8 presidential election and called for a re-election. 
Protesters have called for electoral reform and the dismissal of electoral officials before a new election is held. Some of the protests have resulted in looting and violent confrontations between protesters and police.
The Supreme Court annulled the election result that had re-elected current President Uhuru Kenyatta. The court ruled that the election commission had not adhered to the constitution and election laws. 
Opposition party leader Raila Odinga, who came second in the annulled election, withdrew from the re-scheduled ballot earlier this week. Odinga said the election commission has not implemented any changes to rectify the problems. The commission said the ballot will go ahead, and the new election is scheduled for Oct. 26.

43539,2017-10-13,Trump nominates Kirstjen Nielsen as new head of DHS,"On Thursday, President Trump nominated Kirstjen Nielsen to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Nielsen is currently the Deputy Chief of Staff in the White House. Her nomination is subject to Senate approval.
Nielsen, 45, has a background in cybersecurity. She was Chief of Staff to John Kelly when he was Secretary of DHS and joined him in the White House, when he was appointed Trump’s Chief of Staff. She has previously worked as an attorney in the DHS Transportation Security Administration, as a special adviser on George W. Bush’s Homeland Security Council, as a congressional staff member, and at the nonpartisan Center for Cyber and Homeland Security think tank at George Washington University.
DHS has more than 240,000 employees and a $40 billion budget. The Department is responsible for immigration policy, border and airport security, disaster responses and refugee admissions. If confirmed, Nielsen would take over the post from acting Secretary Elaine Duke. Trump said Duke would stay on as Nielsen’s deputy.

18712,2017-10-14,Trump says he won't certify Iran’s compliance with nuclear deal,"At the White House on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he “cannot and will not” certify that Iran is complying with its nuclear agreement. Trump said that Iran has committed “multiple violations of the agreement,” was “not living up to the spirit of the deal.” The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that Iran is complying with the deal, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for reduced economic sanctions. 
The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 requires the U.S. president to recertify Iran’s compliance with the agreement every 90 days. Trump has certified it twice before, most recently on July 17. If the president does not certify compliance by Sunday, Congress would have 60 days to consider re-imposing sanctions on Iran and ending U.S. participation in the agreement.
The nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was put in place in 2015 after 18 months of negotiations. Iran and six other nations signed it: the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The agreement required Iran to give up about 98 percent of its enriched uranium, to allow nuclear inspections and it also prohibited the country from producing nuclear weapons. The deal’s limit on Iran’s nuclear fuel production is scheduled to expire in 2031 under a so-called “sunset” provision. In exchange for agreeing to the restrictions, the U.S., European Union and other members of the United Nations lifted some sanctions on oil and other products from Iran.
In Trump’s announcement on Friday, he said there were “flaws in the deal,” including: “insufficient enforcement,” the existence of the “sunset” clauses and “near total silence on Iran’s missile programs.” Trump said he would work with Congress to address these points. On Thursday, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), released a proposal to impose sanctions on Iran if it violated certain restrictions, or if U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was less than a year away from producing a nuclear weapon. 
Trump said if “we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. It is under continuous review and our participation can be canceled by me as President at any time.”
During his speech on Friday, Trump said he authorized the Treasury Department to sanction the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) for supporting “terrorism.” The department designated the IRGC as a “terrorist” group on Friday. The State Department has not put the IRGC on its list of foreign terrorist organizations.

18706,2017-10-14,The US Healthcare System: An Overview,"Since Trump’s latest executive order may change aspects of the U.S. healthcare system, it may be useful to know how it currently works. Here’s a brief overview of U.S. healthcare options.
Employer-based insurance
About 49 percent of insured people in 2016 had employer-provided healthcare coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). For those people, the employers subsidize the cost of the insurance, though in some cases workers contribute to the expense via monthly payments, co-payments per doctor visit and deductibles. KFF’s news network also notes that the number of choices an employer provides may depend on the size of the company, with smaller companies offering fewer options for its employees to choose from. Employees may choose insurance plans once a year.
Medicare/Medicaid
Medicaid is a program operated jointly by both federal and state agencies. According to Medicaid.gov, Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage in the United States. People receive Medicaid based on their income level, age and whether they have certain medical conditions, such as blindness. Examples include low income families and individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI).
Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older. It can also cover younger people with certain disabilities, and people with diseases such as End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD).
Individual insurance
People can purchase individual plans for themselves or their families through an insurance company. Pricing and options may vary by state or county of residence.
What did the ACA do?
The law required insurance companies to, among other requirements:

	Cover 10 “essential benefits”, such as maternity leave and prescription drugs.
	Let “young adults” stay on their parent’s insurance until they reach 26.
	Provide free “preventive care” services.

It also:

	Prevents insurance companies from denying coverage or charging customers more based on their health status.
	Eliminates dollar limits or lifetime caps on individual coverage.
	Expands coverage for Medicare and Medicaid.
	Creates new “marketplaces” or “exchanges,” on which private insurance companies compete to sell plans to uninsured Americans.

Individual states can set up their own marketplaces. Alternatively, states can opt out of operating an exchange and allow their residents to purchase insurance under a marketplace established by the federal government. Individuals can still obtain insurance outside of the marketplaces. 
Prior to the Trump administration's Oct. 12 announcement, the federal government allowed people with income under a certain level to receive direct subsidies when they bought individual insurance on an exchange in order to offset their costs. 
What does Trump’s executive order do?
On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that calls for changes to three areas of the Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The order aims to expand access to association health plans (AHPs), increase the maximum time limit of short-term insurance plans (STLDI), and widen the use of health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). 
AHPs
The order states that expanding access to association health plans will make it easier for small businesses to join together in groups across state lines, enabling them to negotiate cheaper health plans for their employees. The Washington Post reported the AHPs will not have to comply with the ACA rules for essential benefits, or yearly and lifetime cost limits. They would also not need to be licensed in the state in which they are sold. The White House says employers would not be allowed to exclude any workers from these plans, or charge higher rates for those in poor health, according to Fox News.
STLDIs
The document calls for increasing the maximum time limit for short-term insurance plans from three months to one year. Short-term insurance policies are aimed at people who are between jobs, or younger people no longer covered by their parents’ health plans. The plans are not required to comply with the ACA rules about protections for people with pre-existing conditions or to include mental health coverage, maternity care, full prescription coverage, all considered essential benefits under ACA rules. There are no price limits on premiums. At the end of 2016, around 160,000 people were covered by this type of policy, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
HRAs
Health reimbursement arrangements allow employers to give employees pre-tax money to buy their own coverage, which does not have to comply with all ACA rules.",Context,,,,,,world_news,publish

The U.K.’s weather center, the Met Office, predicted wind gusts up to 70-80 mph for Northern Ireland, and told people to expect longer travel times due to possible road and bridge closures, as well as flight, rail and ferry cancellations. The Met Office also noted the potential for flying debris, power outages and mobile phone service disruptions in the area.
The Irish Meteorological Service said, “This will be a significant weather event for Ireland with potentially high impacts — structural damage and flooding (particularly coastal) — and people are advised to take extreme care.” The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts winds of at least 39 mph across Ireland.
The storm attained Category 3 status on Saturday, before downgrading to a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday as it continued northeast. According to the Post, the storm is expected to dissipate by Tuesday morning.

43554,2017-10-17,Iraqi army retakes Kirkuk from Kurdish Peshmerga forces,"According to the Iraqi army, Iraqi forces took control of the northern city of Kirkuk from Kurdish Peshmerga forces on Monday. The Iraqi forces said they had captured the airport, an oil field, a military base and the governorate building in Kirkuk, which they reported drew no opposition from Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. 
Kurdish forces had said they would defend Kirkuk, and were in an armed standoff for three days with Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces outside the city. According to Al Jazeera, the city fell within 15 hours of the start of the Iraqi army advance, with Peshmerga fighters apparently withdrawing from the city.
Kurdish Pershmerga forces took control of Kirkuk in the summer of 2014, following the retreat of the Iraqi army from the city during an Islamic State (IS) offensive. Kirkuk is one of the two highest oil-producing regions in Iraq. It is inhabited by Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen and Christians, and is not part of the official area that Iraqi Kurds rule semi-autonomously. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi said “we want (Kirkuk) to remain a city of peaceful coexistence for all Iraqis.”
On Sept. 25, Kurdish regions and some regions disputed between Kurds and Iraqis, including Kirkuk, held a non-binding referendum on independence from Iraq. Of the approximate 63 percent of eligible voters who voted, more than 92.7 percent voted “yes” to independence. Iraq had declared the referendum illegal and, after the vote, the Iraqi parliament requested that Al Abadi send troops to Kirkuk to take back control of the oil fields there.

43557,2017-10-17,EU ministers impose new sanctions on North Korea,"European Union foreign ministers agreed on Monday to ban the sale of oil and oil products to North Korea, as well as ban any future investments and business with the country. The E.U. does not currently sell oil to North Korea. The sanctions are part of measures enacted in response to recent North Korean nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests. North Korea tested a hydrogen bomb on Sept. 3 and a ballistic missile on Sept. 15.
Reuters reports that approximately 400 North Koreans currently work in the E.U. Monday’s sanctions also decrease the maximum amount of money these workers may send to North Korea from 15,000 to 5,000 euros ($17,700 to $5,900). The sanctions also revoke work permit renewals for these individuals, except for refugees and those “in need of international protection,” according to The Associated Press.
The E.U. ministers also sanctioned six businesses and three officials from North Korea, freezing their assets and prohibiting travel to the E.U. According to an E.U. official, the bloc’s sanctions against North Korea now encompass 41 individuals and 10 companies.
The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution on Sept. 11 instituting new sanctions against North Korea, following its sixth nuclear test. The resolution calls on member states to report to the Security Council within 90 days on measures they have taken to implement the resolution, including sanctions.

Some of her posts involved the so-called “Panama Papers” — 11.5 million documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca, an “offshore” law firm in Panama. The documents reportedly detail financial and attorney–client information from over 200,000 entities.
Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the FBI would assist in the investigation. According to local media, the journalist had filed a police report 15 days prior, saying she had received death threats. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing. Caruana Galizia is survived by her husband and three sons.
Malta, an island of 400,000 people, is the smallest country of the E.U. and held the presidency of the bloc earlier this year.

43563,2017-10-17,Ahmad Khan Rahimi convicted of 2016 Chelsea bombing,"On Monday, a federal jury convicted 29-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahimi, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen, of all eight counts against him related to a Sept. 17, 2016 “pressure cooker” bomb that injured 30 in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, as well as two other related incidents. The trial had lasted two weeks and the jury deliberated for about 4 hours.
The two incidents related to the Chelsea bombing involved a bomb that went off that day in a trash can beside the course of a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Park, New Jersey, and an unexploded “pressure cooker bomb” found a few blocks away from the bomb that went off in Chelsea. No one died as a result of any of the bombs, although there was property damage. Within 50 hours of the Chelsea bombing, Rahimi was located and wounded in a shootout with police.
The eight charges against Rahimi included use and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, bombing of a place of public use, and interstate transportation of explosives. A conviction on the use and attempted use of weapons of mass destruction in furtherance of a crime of violence carries a mandatory life sentence, according to acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim. Evidence in the case included DNA and fingerprints. Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 18, 2018.

43570,2017-10-18,Spain’s High Court detains two Catalan pro-independence politicians,"Spain’s High Court in Madrid detained without bail two Catalan pro-independence politicians on Monday. Jordi Sánchez, leader of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), and Jordi Cuixart, leader of Omnium Cultural (OC), are being investigated for alleged sedition – unlawfully encouraging disobedience or violence against government authorities. BBC reported that there were protests over the detentions on Tuesday. Sánchez and Cuixart are being investigated for their role in a Sept. 20 protest, where a group of people blocked some Civil Guard officers inside a building in Barcelona and damaged their vehicles.
Also on Tuesday, Catalonia’s regional government said it would not comply with a request issued by Spain’s national government last Wednesday. The Spanish government in Madrid had asked Catalonia to clarify whether it had officially declared independence by Monday and, if the answer was “yes,” to withdraw its declaration by Thursday. On Monday, Catalonia did not clarify whether it was declaring independence and Catalan President Carles Puigdemont called for talks with Madrid. On Tuesday, Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull said, “On Thursday, we won’t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.”

Both groups are local Islamist organizations that have declared their allegiance to Islamic State (IS), BBC reported. There are about 20 to 30 fighters remaining in the city, along with about 20 hostages, according to Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla.
Marawi is a Muslim-majority city in the otherwise mostly Catholic Philippines. The city has been under Maute control since May this year. More than 350,000 people have left their homes since then, CNN reported.

43579,2017-10-18,Senators reach agreement on plan to continue health care cost-sharing subsidies,"Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) announced Tuesday they had reached an agreement on a plan to continue federal health care cost-sharing subsidies for two years in exchange for more state flexibility in administering the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The cost-sharing subsidies are paid by the federal government to insurance companies to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for lower-income customers. CNN reported the two leaders need co-sponsors from their respective parties in order for the plan to move forward.
The deal would make it easier for states to customize ACA rules to suit their needs. The agreement would also allow all people enrolled in the ACA to sign up for so-called catastrophic plans, which are a type of plan with lower monthly premiums and higher deductibles, and are only available to people under 30 or those who qualify for a “hardship exemption” or “affordability exemption.”
A federal judge had previously ruled that Congress hadn’t legally approved the subsidies, which were halted by the Trump administration last week. Insurers have stated that unless payments are continued, insurance premiums will increase.
Around 6 million people currently benefit from the subsidies, which cost the government around $7 billion a year, according to the Associated Press.

43582,2017-10-19,Kurdish forces retreat from disputed areas in northern Iraq,"Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, retreated Monday and Tuesday from several disputed areas in northern Iraq, which they have held since 2014. The areas include the provincial capital Kirkuk. The Peshmerga had originally taken control of the areas while fighting the Islamic State (IS) group. On Wednesday, Iraq’s army issued a statement saying its forces had completed retaking the areas the Kurdish forces had left. The shift in control is reported to have happened mostly without confrontation. One incident outside Kirkuk resulted in 11 dead.
Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish Region and leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, “blamed the loss of Kirkuk on internal Kurdish disputes,” the BBC reported. Peshmerga commander Wista Rasoul, who leads a division of the opposition party Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, rejected the notion of said disputes, adding that the withdrawal “was a response to the central government’s vastly superior firepower,” according to The Associated Press (AP).
On Tuesday, Barzani announced he would keep working towards independence, after a referendum held three weeks ago resulted in a 92.7 percent majority in favor of an independent Kurdish state. The turnout for the vote was 63 percent.

43585,2017-10-19,Sessions testifies before Senate Judiciary Committee,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. He maintained a previous statement that the dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey was motivated by Comey’s handling of Hillary Clinton’s email case. Sessions declined to describe any private conversations with President Trump, including conversations about Comey’s dismissal, the Russia investigation and the pardoning of Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. AP reports that it is standard policy for attorneys general to appear once a year before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.
In Wednesday’s testimony, Sessions described how he had met with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. three times, saying he had never discussed the 2016 presidential campaign or sanctions against Russia with him. Sessions further told the committee that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had given written opinions to the president on how to handle the Comey case. Sessions also stated that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had not questioned him about his role in the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.

The 18 governors were all from the ruling United Socialist Party. The five other elected governors, from the opposition party Roundtable for Democracy, boycotted the event and were not sworn in. BBC reported that the five governors consider the Assembly illegitimate, and have said they do not recognize its authority. President Nicolás Maduro said that governors who are not sworn in by the Assembly would not be allowed to take up their posts.
The Constituent Assembly is a temporary parliament that has the mandate to draft or reform the Constitution. The opposition views the Assembly as a way for Maduro to extend his power by allowing it to overrule the executive and legislative bodies, according to BBC. The opposition parties allege there were voting irregularities and ballot-tampering during the election. The opposition has not provided any evidence to support its claim, according to Reuters. Polls taken before the election showed the opposition ahead, Reuters reported.

Last week, on Oct. 12, Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal to allow for the joint administration of the Gaza strip by the two parties. The agreement is scheduled to take effect on Dec. 1. Since a disputed election in 2006, and an armed conflict the following year, Fatah has controlled the West Bank and Hamas has controlled the Gaza strip. 
Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.N., U.S., European Union and U.K. Since 2005, it has functioned as a political party, and BBC reported its supporters view it as a “resistance movement.” Hamas, which seeks to have an internationally-recognized Palestinian state, published a policy document earlier this year that stated for the first time the boundaries of such a state should fall within the internationally recognized 1967 borders. Hamas’ policy document does not recognize the state of Israel, or give up its armed fight against Israel.

43611,2017-10-23,US Secretary of State Tillerson tells Iranian forces to leave Iraq,"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iranian-backed militias involved in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq should “go home” and allow Iraq to “regain control” of the region, saying that the fight is “coming to a close.” Tillerson made the statement during a joint meeting with the leaders of Iraq and Saudi Arabia on Sunday. 
A senior U.S. official cited by Reuters later said that Tillerson was referring to the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and the the Quds Force. The PMF, established in 2014 to fight IS, is a mostly Iraqi force that was trained and funded by Iran. The Quds Force is the foreign paramilitary and espionage branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The U.S. official said the “ideal” scenario would be for those militia fighters to either “go home” or “integrate into the Iraqi security forces.”
Earlier on Sunday, Tillerson attended an inaugural council meeting between Iraq and Saudi Arabia designed to coordinate their fight against IS and rebuild Iraqi territory affected by the conflict. Saudi King Salman, Saudi foreign minister Adel Jubeir and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi also attended the meeting. 
Tillerson said the council would help build Iraq’s private sector and increase foreign investment. The council agreed to reopen the office of chemical company Saudi Basic Industries Corp in Iraq and grant Saudi agriculture company SALIC an investment license.
The meeting was part of a six-day trip for Tillerson that includes visits to Pakistan, India and Switzerland.

43614,2017-10-23,Italy’s Lombardy and Veneto vote for more autonomy in non-binding referendums,"Italy’s Lombardy and Veneto regions voted in support of greater autonomy in non-binding referendums on Sunday. The regions’ presidents said that 90 percent of voters approved of greater autonomy, BBC reported. Prior to the result, Lombardy leader Roberto Maroni said, “We remain inside the Italian nation with more autonomy,” and would “not for now” seek to become an independent country. Maroni described the vote as an effort to negotiate tax rates and other regional issues with Rome. 
Lombardy, which includes Milan, and Veneto, which includes Venice, account for about 30 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Maroni and regional leader Luca Zaia of Veneto initiated the referendums. They claim the northern regions subsidize the country’s poorer southern regions. Maroni said Lombardy pays about €54 billion more in taxes to Rome than value it receives back, and said he wants to cut the taxes owed in half. Zaia said Rome should reimburse Veneto for its tax deficit, which she said amounts to €20 billion. 
Both leaders are part of the Northern League party, which has previously attempted secession from Italy. Five regions in Italy already have regional autonomy, including Sardinia, Sicily, and Friuli-Venezia. Italy’s constitution allows for referendums like Sunday’s.

The Freedom and Direct Democracy came in fourth place with 10.6 percent of the vote. The Social Democrats received 7.3 percent of the vote and the Christian Democrats won 5.8 percent.
Babis will need to form a coalition with other political parties to have a parliamentary majority. The Civic Democrats and two smaller parties, STAN and TOP09, have already said they would not form a coalition with ANO, according to Reuters. Three other parties, the Social Democrats, the Christian Democrats and the Pirate Party, have said they may form a coalition with ANO in parliament on the condition that Babis is not involved.

Babis, who was the government’s finance minister until May, is the county’s second-richest man, with an estimated networth of $4 billion. He owns two regional newspapers and a radio station. On October 9, Babis said he had been charged with fraud in a case involving a €2 million EU subsidy from 10 years ago. According to Reuters, Babis allegedly did not disclose ownership of a farm and conference center so that the properties could qualify for an EU subsidy for small businesses. Babis denies any wrongdoing.

President Zeman said he would meet Babis on Monday to discuss the position, without making the formal appointment.

Gary “Mike” Rose at the White House. Rose was a Green Beret medic during the Vietnam War who treated more than 60 wounded soldiers during a 1970 covert mission, Operation Tailwind, in Laos. According to NPR, the troops came under fire while they were being airlifted in by helicopter, and the attack continued when they were on the ground.
Rose was reportedly injured during his second day in Laos, when shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade explosion lodged into his back, leg and foot. When he was evacuated via helicopter on the fourth day, the helicopter came under fire and crashed a few miles away. According to USA Today, Rose then pulled other men from the wreckage and tended to the surviving soldiers’ wounds until another helicopter came to evacuate them. In addition to Rose, 136 U.S. soldiers as well as some South Vietnamese soldiers were involved in the covert operation. In total, three men died as a result of the mission.
After the battle, Rose was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest award for valor after the Medal of Honor. Throughout his career, he has also received the Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and more than 12 other military awards. 
Rose, 69, said he considered the award “a collective medal” and that he wanted to “accept this in honor of all the men and women who fought in that era.”

Joseph Dunford gave a press conference providing details surrounding the deaths of four U.S. soldiers attacked in Niger on Oct. 4. He said 12 U.S. Special Operations Task Force members were returning to their base from a reconnaissance mission, along with 30 Nigerian troops, when they came under attack from about 50 combatants from an IS-affiliated group. 
Dunford said the team requested support an hour after the attack began. A remotely piloted aircraft arrived “within minutes,” French Mirage jets arrived about an hour later, and French attack helicopters evacuated the dead and wounded some time after that. 
U.S. Sgt. La David Johnson went missing after the attack, and his body was recovered two days later. Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie said last week that U.S., French and Nigerian troops “never left the battlefield” until they located Johnson. Dunford said the U.S. is investigating whether the U.S.-Nigerian team had deviated from its planned mission, and how Johnson had been separated from the other troops.

Trump said in a Fox Business Network interview on Sunday he believes the deal will “probably” be renegotiated.
The coalition is comprised of five vehicle manufacturer and dealer associations, some of which represent automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai. Jennifer Thomas, Vice President of Federal Affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which is part the coalition, said that terminating NAFTA will lead to a reduced number of jobs in the industry and a decline in cars produced. The coalition's advertising campaign is estimated to cost more than $500,000 and run for four weeks, according to Bloomberg.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported that since NAFTA came into effect in 1994, annual trade between the U.S., Canada and Mexico has increased 3.5-fold to $1.2 trillion.

43640,2017-10-25,Nicaragua says it will join Paris climate agreement,"Nicaragua’s Vice President Rosario Murillo announced Monday the country would join the Paris climate agreement and that the necessary documents have been submitted to the United Nations. When the agreement was adopted in 2015 by 195 countries, Nicaragua declined to join. The country’s chief climate negotiator, Paul Oquist, said at the time the deal would not do enough to prevent a potential increase in global temperatures to three degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
In Monday’s statement, Murillo and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said the “majority of both developed and developing states have undertaken the commitment to join” the Paris agreement, which, “despite not being the ideal agreement, is the only instrument that currently allows this unity of intentions and efforts.”
With Nicaragua’s decision to join the Paris accord, there are two countries that have not joined the agreement or have announced plans to leave it: the U.S. and Syria. President Donald Trump said in June the U.S. would withdraw from the deal.

43643,2017-10-25,US considering sanctions on Myanmar; withdraws assistance programs,"The U.S. State Department released a statement Monday saying it was considering imposing additional sanctions on Myanmar over the country’s treatment of its Rohingya people, a Sunni Muslim ethnic group. In addition, Myanmar military personnel involved in operations in Myanmar’s Rakhine state will no longer be eligible to participate in U.S. assistance programs.
The U.S. State Department said it was considering sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which authorizes the president to block or revoke visas of selected individuals, or impose economic sanctions on them if they are responsible for corruption, extrajudicial killings, torture or other human rights violations. The department is also looking into economic sanctions under the JADE Act, which states it is U.S. policy to hold individuals accountable who are responsible for the repression of peaceful political activity in Myanmar.
The U.S. already has an embargo on military sales with Myanmar and, since Aug. 25, has terminated travel waivers under the JADE Act for military officials. The State Department is also exploring international options for holding Myanmar accountable, including collaboration with the UN Human Rights Council.
More than 600,000 Rohingya refugees have left their homes and crossed the border into Bangladesh since late August, according to Bangladesh’s UN ambassador. The migration began after 12 people were killed in an attack on a Myanmar police post on Aug. 25. Since then, the Myanmar military has burned villages and killed Rohingya villagers, according to media reports.

43646,2017-10-25,Iran sentences person to death for providing information to Israeli intelligence agency,"Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi announced Tuesday that Iran sentenced a person to death for providing “sensitive information about Iran’s military and nuclear sites” to Israeli intelligence agency Mossad “in return for money and residency in Sweden.” The information included details about Iranian nuclear and military scientists, two of whom were killed in bomb attacks in 2010, the Associated Press reported. Iran did not say when the verdict had been issued.
Dolatabadi said the convicted person gave Mossad information about some 30 Iranians involved in military and nuclear projects. At least four Iranian scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012, according to Reuters. Iran claimed the killings were part of a plan to sabotage its nuclear program.
Dolatabadi did not name the convicted person in his announcement, but Amnesty International said Monday that Ahmadreza Djalali, an Iranian doctor who lives in Sweden and has taught there, had been sentenced to death on espionage charges in Iran.

43649,2017-10-26,Kenya presidential election to move forward Thursday,"On Wednesday, Kenya’s Supreme Court Chief Justice David Maraga announced that a petition to delay the country’s presidential election could not be heard by the court, as only two of the seven justices were available for a hearing. One justice was on sick leave, one missed a return flight to Nairobi, another was absent as her bodyguard was shot on Tuesday, and two were “unable to come to court” for unspecified reasons. 
The petition, filed by activists Tuesday, argued that the electoral commission was not in a position to conduct a free and fair vote. After the Supreme Court’s announcement, Kenya’s Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission said the election would go ahead Thursday as planned.
The Supreme Court annulled the result of an Aug. 8 presidential election in a 4-2 vote, saying there had been “irregularities and illegalities.” Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who came in second to current President Uhuru Kenyatta, has withdrawn from the new election and asked his supporters to boycott Thursday’s vote, which he wants to postpone. Kenyatta has called the justices who annulled the August vote “crooks.”

43652,2017-10-26,US imposes new security measures on inbound international flights,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced that all incoming flights to the U.S. would be subject to new security measures starting Thursday. A TSA spokesperson said the new rules would include “heightened screening of personal electronic devices,” and “stricter” security procedures around planes and in airport terminals. The rules will affect around 2,100 flights arriving in the U.S. each day.  
The new measures were announced in June, and airlines were given 120 days to implement them. The rules are designed to avoid a general in-cabin ban on laptops, following a similar temporary ban for eight countries in North Africa and the Middle East that was suspended in July. That ban had been issued due to concerns that explosives could be hidden in laptops. Airlines have since begun to use CT scanners to inspect personal electronics devices just before passengers board the plane.
Airlines have proposed several ways to carry out the new measures, including questionnaires, inspections of personal electronic devices and short interviews with airline staff, either at check-in or at the boarding gate.

43655,2017-10-26,Israel approves 176 new homes in East Jerusalem settlement,"On Wednesday, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat’s office issued permits for 176 new housing units in the Nof Zion settlement in East Jerusalem, which Israel has occupied since 1967. Around 200,000 Jewish settlers and 370,000 Palestinians live there. The expansion will almost triple the size of the settlement, which is surrounded by the Palestinian neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber. 
Israel annexed the territory in 1980, an action that has not been recognized by the international community. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, and the Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. These competing claims to East Jerusalem are one of the disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Associated Press also reported that Israel’s cabinet minister for transportation and intelligence announced that a ministerial committee would vote on a proposal to expand Jerusalem’s municipal area to include “a number” of West Bank settlements. This would increase the proportion of Jewish settlers to Palestinians living in the city.

43658,2017-10-26,US Senate repeals rule banning ‘forced arbitration’ clauses,"The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday night to repeal a rule banning banks and credit card companies from using “forced arbitration” clauses in their products. Companies use such clauses to resolve disputes outside the court system. The Senate voted 51-50 to repeal the rule, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the deciding vote. The House approved the same resolution in a 231-190 vote in July, and it will now go to President Donald Trump for signature.
The arbitration clauses stipulate that customers cannot join any class action suits to settle disputes, but instead have to take their complaint to closed-door arbitration. Reuters reports that critics of the rule have said class-action suits, in which plaintiffs join together, only benefit trial lawyers and that arbitration generally wins larger settlements for customers. Supporters say “forced arbitration” removes the customer’s right to sue, which is incorporated in the U.S. Constitution, and puts banks in control of the process instead of customers.

43661,2017-10-27,Iraq PM rejects Kurdish call for independence talks,"On Thursday, Iraq’s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the government would only accept a “cancellation” of last month’s Kurdish independence referendum, in response to the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) offer to “freeze” the vote and start negotiations with Iraq. “We accept only the cancellation of the referendum and the adherence to the constitution,” Abadi said on Thursday. A day earlier, on Wednesday, the KRG had said a “freeze” of the referendum would “prevent further violence.”
The Iraqi central government in Baghdad has said the Sept. 25 independence vote, in which more than 90 percent of voters in the Kurdish areas supported independence, was illegal. Since the ballot, Iraqi forces have retaken several areas in northern Iraq, including the provincial capital Kirkuk, which had been held by Kurdish troops since 2014. The Kurdistan Region Security Council said that 150,000 people have been displaced from their homes during the Iraqi campaign.
The Kurdistan Region is an area in Iraq with a semi-autonomous regional government. The Kurds are an ethnic population with their own language, and comprise about 30 million people residing in Middle Eastern countries like Iraq, Turkey and Syria.

The resolution was adopted by a vote of 216 to 212, with all Democratic and some Republican representatives voting against the measure. The budget resolution includes rules that will allow the Senate to adopt new tax reforms by a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes normally required. The Senate approved the resolution in a 51-49 vote last week.
A budget resolution is not the same as the spending bills that funds the government. The resolution is nonbinding and does not have to be signed by President Donald Trump.

43667,2017-10-27,"Tillerson visits Pakistan, India; discusses US South Asia strategy","U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Pakistan on Tuesday and India on Wednesday to discuss U.S. strategy for South Asia as outlined by President Donald Trump in August. At a press conference with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj in New Delhi, Tillerson said that “too many terrorist organizations … find a safe place in Pakistan from which to conduct their operations and attacks against other countries.” Pakistan has denied such “safe havens” exist within its borders.
Regarding Pakistan, Tillerson said terrorist organizations’ increasing “strength” could “lead to a threat to Pakistan’s own stability,” and that “It is not in anyone’s interest that the Government of Pakistan be destabilized.” Tillerson added, “We want to work with Pakistan in a positive way because we think this is in their interest.”
During the press conference, Tillerson also remarked on the U.S.’ willingness to provide advanced technologies to India’s military, and he spoke about India’s “important” role in the “fight against terrorism” and the two democracies’ “shared values.” Tillerson further mentioned India’s “contributions to development in Afghanistan” and the U.S.-India trade relationship, including U.S. oil exports that started this month.
Tillerson and Swaraj also discussed North Korea. India has an embassy there, while the U.S. does not. Swaraj said India’s trade with North Korea had been “reduced considerably” since North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests. She said the “very small” Indian embassy in Pyongyang should remain open to to serve as a diplomatic channel. Swaraj also said she and Tillerson discussed potential changes to H-1B visa legislation that could adversely affect the ability of “skilled” Indian professionals to work in the U.S.
During the Islamabad visit, Tillerson met with Pakistan’s interim prime minister, army chief and other leaders. While in India, Tillerson also met with Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, he visited a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi erected in the location where Gandhi was shot and killed on Jan. 30, 1948, and he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

43670,2017-10-27,"3 killed, 25 injured at Kenya election protests","At least three people were killed and 25 injured on Thursday during protests against a scheduled rerun of the Kenyan presidential election, after the previous vote’s results had been annulled. In portions of the country, protesters put up burning barricades, set fires and threw stones at police, Reuters reported. Police officers responded with tear gas and fired live ammunition over protesters’ heads, according to the outlet. 
The independent electoral commission postponed voting in four of Kenya’s 47 counties until Saturday, citing “security challenges.” The counties are all in the west of Kenya, where the opposition reportedly has the strongest support, according to The Associated Press. In some areas the polling stations had been padlocked, and others that were open did not have election supplies, according to Reuters. Reuters reported that it contacted 18 polling stations and by midday the maximum number of voters that had come through any station was 27. The Kenyan Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) tweeted that turnout was an estimated 48 percent. 
Opposition leader Raila Odinga said the election should be postponed until there is  election reform. With no reform, he withdrew from the race and called upon his supporters to boycott the vote. Odinga said Thursday’s vote would not be credible. Incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta asked people to turn out “in huge numbers.” The IEBC reports that there were eight presidential candidates on the ballot, including Odinga.
Reuters reported that around 50 people have been killed since the annulled August vote, in which President Kenyatta was reelected. In 2007, following Odinga losing a presidential bid against Kenyatta, fighting in the country resulted in more than 1,000 deaths and 600,000 displaced from their homes, The Associated Press reported.

43673,2017-10-27,Trump orders release of nearly 2900 files on John F. Kennedy,"U.S. President Donald Trump instructed the National Archive to release 2,891 previously classified files related to former President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. Those files, from the FBI, CIA and other agencies, are available for public download here. The administration is temporarily withholding other files deemed “sensitive,” mainly at the request of the FBI and CIA, for review over the next 180 days. If they are determined not to be a risk to national security, law enforcement or foreign policy concerns, the remainder of the files are scheduled to be released on April 26, 2018. 
“I have no choice -- today -- but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation's security,” Trump announced about his decision to have files reviewed further. 
In 1964, a year after JFK’s death on Nov. 22, 1963, the Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. marine, had acted alone in assassinating Kennedy. Oswald was fatally shot on Nov. 24, 1963, two days after JFK’s death, by a Texas nightclub owner.

43678,2017-10-30,Iraqi Kurdish President Barzani won’t seek a fourth term,"Massoud Barzani, president of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, announced on Sunday that he will not seek reelection when his term ends in four days. The region’s parliament voted 70 to 23 to accept Barzani’s resignation, according to Kurdish TV channels Rudaw and Kurdistan 24. Currently in his third term, Barzani has been the region’s president since 2005.
Protesters entered parliament during the vote, and according to eyewitnesses cited by BBC, some carried clubs. Reuters reported that some demonstrators said members of parliament had “insulted” Barzani; the outlet didn’t elaborate.
Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region voted in favor of independence last month. The Kurdish government offered to freeze the vote in order to start independence negotiations with Iraq, which Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi recently rejected. 
Barzani said he will continue to help the Kurdish people “in their struggle for independence.” His senior assistant Hemin Hawrami said Barzani would stay in politics as leader of the High Political Council, which was formed to do post-referendum work on Kurdish independence, according to Al Jazeera. When the council formed in early October, it said that no pressure or threat would deter the region from upholding the vote result, according to Kurdish paper Rudaw. 
According to an unnamed Kurdish official cited by Reuters, regional elections that were originally scheduled for Nov. 1 have been delayed for eight months.

Last Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of new sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic missile program. The U.S. said Iran may be in violation of a 2015 nuclear agreement for developing missiles that may be capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Iran has said it has no plans to build “nuclear-capable” weapons, according to Reuters.

43690,2017-10-31,Kenyatta wins repeat election for Kenyan presidency,"The Kenyan electoral commission announced Monday that incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in an Oct. 26 election. Turnout for the vote was 7.6 million, or 39 percent of the 19.6 million registered voters. The opposition party of Raila Odinga, who had run against Kenyatta in a nullified August election, boycotted the election. If confirmed, Kenyatta would serve a second five-year term.
Thursday’s vote was a repeat of the Aug. 8 election, whose results the Supreme Court invalidated based on procedural irregularities. Kenyatta, 55, had won that election with 54.3 percent of the votes in a field of eight candidates, with over 15 million people voting. Odinga, 72, came in second with 44.7 percent of votes.
The Oct. 26 election took place in 266 of 291 constituencies. Polling stations remained closed in 25 constituencies due to protests. Odinga withdrew from the race before the vote last week, saying that reforms had not been instituted to avoid a repeat of the “illegalities and irregularities” of the August election.
Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a civil society organization coalition that monitored last week’s election, said there were “multiple” instances of polling station results that differed from results posted online through an election portal. One example in the coalition’s report showed 133 votes for Kenyatta, while the online form showed 433 votes.

43693,2017-10-31,Court issues hold on Trump transgender service member ban,"A U.S. District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction on Monday, ruling that part of President Donald Trump’s presidential memorandum on transgender people in the military would be blocked from implementation while the case continues to be reviewed. The policy barred transgender people from enlisting in the military until Jan. 1, 2018 and it barred allocating military funds for gender reassignment surgery. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the proposed ban on transgender service members would violate their Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
The injunction in the Doe v Trump case means that transgender people would be allowed to enlist in the military starting Jan. 1, 2018, in the absence of future rulings. Kollar-Kotelly also ruled to allow the memorandum’s ban on military funds for gender reassignment surgery. She wrote that the plaintiffs had not shown they would be harmed by the lack of such funds.
The Doe v Trump case was brought when the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and GLBTQ Legal Advocates  Defenders (GLAD) sued Trump in August on behalf of six unnamed service members (so-called “John and Jane Doe’s”) and two recruits.
The ACLU has a separate, pending case in Maryland on behalf of some active transgender service members.

After the Supreme Court ruled last year that Australia’s detention of the refugees was illegal, the Australian and PNG governments announced the center, located on Manus Island, would be closed on Oct. 31 this year.
Media reports said the 606 refugees were not complying with a request to relocate to alternate locations on Tuesday. The refugees said the other facilities do not offer the same security as the one they’re in now and they are concerned about possibly being attacked by locals if they leave.
PNG authorities said they would cut off water, electricity and food to the center by 5 p.m. local time on Tuesday. Utilities had not been shut off as of an hour after the deadline, according to unnamed refugee advocates.
The Australia-based Refugee Action Coalition (RAC) said locals had entered the facility and stolen items like electric fans and refrigerators on Tuesday. An RAC spokesperson said locals “can’t get into the detention center proper” and “the detainees are still secure.”
For the last four years, Australian authorities have paid PNG and the island nation of Nauru to house asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat.

Puigdemont also said that his party would participate in the Dec. 21 regional elections called by Spain’s government in Madrid. Until then, he said he and his team would stay in Brussels.
The Spanish government imposed direct rule over the autonomous region of Catalonia last week, after the Catalan regional government voted in favor of declaring independence last Friday. Madrid’s Constitutional Court said Tuesday it was suspending the declaration while the court studied its legal merits.

Media outlets reported it was not known how many of the 126 million people saw these posts in their feeds.
In the statement, Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch wrote, ""Most of the ads appear to focus on divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”
Facebook, Twitter and Google are due to testify before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Wednesday as part of ongoing investigations into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

If the court grants his request, Zuma said he would set up a commission to investigate the allegations within 30 days. 
Zuma has previously challenged the ability of the Public Protector to call for an investigation into the corruption allegations. According to its website, the Public Protector is an independent institution with a mandate to investigate, report on and remedy improper conduct in all state affairs.

43717,2017-11-02,Britain to set Northern Ireland budget in absence of agreement,"Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he would introduce a British-authored budget for Northern Ireland. Britain has not imposed a budget in Northern Ireland in 10 years. The decision comes after Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Sinn Fein party did not reach an agreement on a budget. The 1998 Good Friday peace agreement enabled the formation of a Northern Ireland government with power shared between Sinn Fein and the DUP. Sinn Fein withdrew from the agreement in January, suspending Northern Ireland’s Executive Office.
Sinn Fein and the DUP were negotiating issues, including funding to support the Irish language, same sex marriage, and a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams indicated his party was open to further dialogue if it was “meaningful.” If an agreement were reached between the DUP and Sinn Fein, they could still pass their own budget independently of the British budget.
The Good Friday peace agreement between Britain, Ireland and some of the political parties of Northern Ireland was reached after 30 years of violence between those who wanted Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom and those who wanted it to be part of the Republic of Ireland. During that period, 3,600 people were killed.

43723,2017-11-02,Study: machine learning on brain scans identifies suicidal thoughts with 91% accuracy,"A research team co-led by Marcel Just, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reported Monday that brain scans could be used with 91 percent accuracy to identify whether a person had suicidal thoughts. The report in Nature Human Behaviour said the study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to perform the brain scans and machine learning to identify patterns in those scans.
Just’s team performed brain scans on 34 subjects while having them think about different words such as praise, bliss, carefree, kindness, terrible, cruelty, evil, fatal, funeral and death. The words were based in part on the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire. The brain scan results were processed into the form of “voxels,” or 3-D pixels, representing levels of activity in different parts of the brain while subjects thought about each word. These results were then used by a machine learning algorithm that recognized patterns in the data.
Just said the machine learning program “correctly identified 15 of the 17 suicidal participants and 16 of the 17 controls.” The program could reportedly predict those who had attempted suicide with 94 percent accuracy.
According to NPR, more than 44,000 people per year commit suicide in the U.S.

43726,2017-11-03,Catalan ministers remanded for independence efforts,"On Thursday, a Spanish court remanded eight Catalan ministers into custody, after summoning 13 ministers plus the former Catalan leader. On Tuesday, the Spanish High Court had summoned former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and 13 Catalan ministers to arrive at Spain's criminal court by Thursday and Friday for questioning. Nine of the summoned ministers arrived at court on Thursday. Prosecutors accuse the ministers of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds for their role in Catalonia’s Oct. 1 independence vote. 
Puigdemont, who is currently in Belgium, was not among those remanded into custody on Thursday. Prosecutors asked the judge to issue a European Arrest Warrant for Puigdemont and four other ministers staying in Belgium who did not show up to court. Puigdemont’s lawyer said he will not go to Spain and has requested that he be questioned in Belgium. 
The Spanish government imposed direct rule over the autonomous region of Catalonia last week, after the Catalan regional government voted in favor of declaring independence last Friday.

43729,2017-11-03,Trump nominates Jerome Powell for Federal Reserve Chair,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday nominated Jerome Powell to head the Federal Reserve. If confirmed by the Senate, Powell will replace current chair Janet Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February 2018. Powell is currently a member of the Fed’s board of governors.
The Fed sets monetary policy that affects interest rates, and is the central bank of the United States. The Fed’s website describes its work as promoting “the effective operation of the U.S. economy.” According to NPR, Powell has agreed with Yellen’s policies on interest rate increases and supports Dodd-Frank banking reforms that were enacted after the 2008 financial recession. Powell reportedly opposes the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from using their own funds to conduct short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options.
Powell was nominated to the Fed by Former President Barack Obama in 2012. He is a lawyer and was a partner at the Washington-based private equity firm The Carlyle Group. He also served as an undersecretary of the Treasury during the George H.W. Bush administration.
The current chair, Yellen, is the first woman to hold the post. She can remain on the Fed board as a governor until her 14-year governor's term ends in 2024. According to NPR, this is the first time in around four decades that a president has not reappointed the Fed chair for a second term.

Official government sources did not immediately confirm the news. Syrian state media had reported earlier that military forces had retaken some neighborhoods in the city.
“Fighting has ended, now there are sweeping operations under way,” said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman.
Hours before the Observatory’s announcement, a military source interviewed by AFP said IS was working to defend its remaining locations using snipers, vehicle bombs, and female “suicide bombers.”
Syrian government troops, backed by Russian air raids, entered the primarily IS-controlled city in September after three years of fighting. Earlier Thursday, SANA news agency said Syrian government forces had surrounded IS fighters in al-Hamidiya, Sheikh Yasin, al-Hawiqa and al-Rashdia neighbourhoods in Deir el-Zour. 
At the same time as the Syrian army attack, according to Al Jazeera, a U.S.-led coalition provided air support to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-Arab alliance that is also fighting IS in Deir el-Zour.

43735,2017-11-03,Trump’s Agriculture nominee withdraws from consideration,"Sam Clovis has withdrawn his name from consideration for an undersecretary position at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). President Donald Trump had nominated Clovis to be the undersecretary of research, education and economics at the USDA. 
Clovis cited Washington’s “political climate” as the reason for his decision. “The political climate inside Washington has made it impossible for me to receive balanced and fair consideration for this position,” he said in a statement.
Clovis has been a radio show host and a political science professor. He holds a bachelor’s degree in political science, an MBA and a doctorate in public administration. The 2008 “Food, Conservation, and Energy Act” says appointees to the position should be chosen “from among distinguished scientists with specialized training or significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics.” According to The Washington Post, the USDA position has previously been held by people with advanced degrees in science or medicine.
In an Oct. 17 letter to a senator reviewing his nomination, Clovis said he had not taken any graduate classes in natural sciences and had not held any membership or leadership roles at any agricultural scientific, agricultural education, or agricultural economic organizations.
Clovis was a  co-chairman for the Trump campaign and its chief policy adviser. During the campaign, Clovis supervised George Papadopoulos, who in October pleaded guilty to one count of “making a false statement” to FBI agents. NBC News reported that Clovis was questioned last week by special counsel Robert Mueller's team and testified before the grand jury on his supervisory role of Papadopoulos.

43753,2017-11-06,Puigdemont and 4 ex-Catalan officials turn themselves in to Belgium police,"Five former Catalan ministers, including ex-president Carles Puigdemont, surrendered themselves to Belgian police. They turned themselves in at 9:17 a.m. local time on Sunday, according to a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor’s office, Gilles Dejemeppe. The five ministers had left Catalonia before they were scheduled to appear before a Spanish judge on Thursday over their role in declaring Catalan independence. 
A Spanish judge arrested nine other former Catalan ministers on Thursday in Spain when they appeared in court over their role in the Catalan referendum, which had been declared illegal by the Spanish constitutional court. One minister was freed on bail. Spain then ordered international arrest warrants for Puidgemont and the former Catalan ministers in Belgium: Toni Comin (health), Lluis Puig (culture), Merixell Serret (agriculture), and Clara Ponsati (education). 
The charges against Puigdemont and the other ministers include sedition, rebellion, abuse of authority, misuse of funds and contempt. A Belgian judge was given until 9:17 a.m. local time Monday to decide whether to issue an arrest warrant and put the five in jail or let them remain free during the process of extraditing them to Spain, which could take more than 60 days. The judge could deny extradition if the court determined it would violate the suspect’s human rights, such as the right to a fair trial. 
After Catalonia declared independence on Oct. 27, Spain dissolved Catalonia’s government and called for elections to be held on Dec. 21. Puigdemont’s party, the Catalan European Democratic Party, said it wanted him to represent the party in the upcoming election.

43756,2017-11-06,"Media consortium examining leaked financial documents for potential wrongdoing by politicians, others","On Sunday, media outlets reported information about business dealings identified in millions of documents that were leaked from offshore law firms operating in “tax havens.” The German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung shared the documents, known as the “Paradise Papers,” with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) more than six months ago for them to investigate offshore interests. One of the firms, Appleby, said it has investigated and is “satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients.”
There are more than 13.4 million documents being analyzed, including emails, bank statements, and loan agreements. Many documents are from Appleby, a 119-year old law firm that operates in other “tax havens,” including the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man as well as Hong Kong and Shanghai. Some of the other “Paradise Paper” documents originated from Asiaciti Trust, based in Singapore, and 19 government corporate registries. The term “tax haven” is used to describe countries with no taxes or low tax rates and minimal disclosure requirements to foreign tax authorities.
The Associated Press reported that some documents refer to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ business dealings, including his investment in Navigator Holdings. 
The ICIJ, based in Washington, D.C., won the Pulitzer Prize for its reporting the so-called Panama Papers last year. Those papers, comprised of 11.5 million documents, were leaked from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, to the same German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung. The prime minister of Iceland resigned last year following the release of the Panama Papers.

43738,2017-11-07,Iraq’s Supreme Court rules Kurdish independence vote unconstitutional,"On Monday, Iraq’s Supreme Court ruled that a Sept. 25 Kurdish independence vote was unconstitutional, and that there are no articles in the Iraqi constitution allowing any region or province to secede. Since the vote, Iraqi government troops have retaken control of areas in northern Iraq, which had been held by Kurdish forces since 2014, including the provincial capital Kirkuk. Monday’s ruling came in response to a petition filed by the central government in Baghdad, alleging “wrong misinterpretation” (sic) of the constitution and asserting the unity of Iraq. 
After the ruling, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi issued a statement, asking the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region to abide by the court’s decision, saying “We call on the region to clearly state its commitment to non-separation or independence from Iraq.” He added that the Iraqi central government was “taking the necessary measures to impose federal authorities.” The Kurdish authorities have yet to respond to the ruling.

19478,2017-11-07,"A brief overview of offshore accounts, tax evasion","What’s the difference between 'tax avoidance' and 'tax evasion'?
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses the following definitions; other countries may make different distinctions between the two activities:

	Tax avoidance: minimizing taxes using methods approved by the IRS, such as business expense deductions. Tax avoidance lessens one’s tax liability.
	Tax evasion: not paying taxes or deliberately underpaying taxes by not reporting all income earned. Tax evasion is considered illegal in the U.S.

Why is tax evasion illegal?
Taxes contribute to a country’s revenue, and help to fund government programs or reduce a country’s deficit. The lower the tax income, the less revenue a country receives. Since income is taxed, underreporting one’s income, a form of tax evasion, may negatively affect a country’s tax revenue.
A 2012 report by the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy group, estimated that about $21 to $32 trillion in worldwide wealth is unreported and therefore not taxed.
The IRS estimates the U.S. loses about $458 billion in tax revenue annually due to the underreporting of business income. “A high level of voluntary tax compliance remains critical to help ensure taxpayer faith and fairness in the tax system. Those who don’t pay what they owe ultimately shift the tax burden to those who properly meet their tax obligations,” says the IRS.
A 2017 report by the EU studied the link between offshore activities and money laundering. The report found that about US$1.5 to $2.8 trillion, or between 2 percent and 5 percent of the worldwide GDP, is lost annually through money laundering. The report based its findings on some of the information disclosed in the “Panama Papers.”
How have governments addressed the misuse of offshore accounts?
Since offshore accounts may contain unreported revenue, governments around the world have worked to curtail the misuse of such accounts. Below are a few examples of such efforts.
In 2010, former U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) into law to “combat tax evasion.” FATCA requires certain foreign institutions to report on the foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders, or be subject to penalties.
In 2016, Obama announced changes to the Treasury Department to address tax evasion:

	The “Customer Due Diligence” rule requires financial institutions, such as banks and mutual funds, to verify who owns and profits from the companies that make use of their services. If a company opens an account at a financial institution, that institution is required to identify and verify the people behind that company. Obama said this rule gives financial institutions and law enforcement the ability to identify assets and accounts that may be used by criminals and national security threats.
	The Treasury must require certain foreign-owned companies based in the U.S. to obtain a tax identification number from the IRS to help report and track ownership and transaction information.

A report posted on Medium reviewed the actions taken by various governments one year after the “Panama Papers” were released. It said 70 countries launched at least 150 investigations or audits on the people and corporations linked to the “Panama Papers,” which resulted in the recovery of about $110 million in unpaid taxes or asset seizures.
The EU has also recommended a few steps its members can take to curtail tax evasion via offshore accounts, such as sanctioning those who violate tax evasion rules, or encouraging compliance by offering incentives for reporting on offshore income and assets. The EU also suggested using new encryption technologies that may allow for information sharing between financial institutions and EU member states, without breaching confidentiality rules.",Business|Context,,investigation|leak,ICIJ|International Consortium of Investigative Journalists,,offshore investments|privacy|tax evasion|taxes,world_news,publish
43762,2017-11-08,US to end temporary residency program for Nicaraguans in 2019,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would suspend a temporary residency program for Nicaraguans in the U.S. as of Jan. 5, 2019. Acting U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke made the announcement on Monday. The program, known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), was implemented for people from Nicaragua and Honduras in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch. 
The Nicaraguans will now have an additional 12 months to leave the U.S. or seek another lawful immigration status. There are currently 5,000 Nicaraguans and 86,000 residents from Honduras living in the U.S. with TPS status. 
Nicaraguan and Honduran TPS recipients have been required to renew their status every 18 months since 1999, and both programs were set to expire on January 5, 2018. DHS postponed a decision on whether to end the Honduran program in order to gather more information. This automatically renewed the Hondurans’ protection for six months, until July 2018. 
The program was originally created to provide temporary protection to people from countries damaged by war or natural disaster. The program currently covers 435,000 people from nine different countries. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump ended the Temporary Protected Status for Sudan.

43765,2017-11-08,US Senate Banking Committee approves new North Korea sanctions,"On Tuesday, the bipartisan U.S. Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved a bill for new sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile program, and sent it to the full Senate for consideration. The measures in the bill are directed at foreign financial institutions that assist entities already covered by other North Korea-related sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress, by presidential order or through a U.N. Security Council resolution. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said the bill, if approved and enacted, could affect foreign banks in China and Malaysia. 
The sanctions bill includes a provision to address human traffickers’ access to the banking system, and calls for a presidential task force to assess how anti-money laundering efforts could help prevent trafficking, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said. The bill also requires the Trump administration to come up with an overall strategy on relations with North Korea within 90 days, Bloomberg reported. The bill is called the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,” named for a U.S. student who died after he was imprisoned in North Korea. 
The Senate has not announced when it would vote on the bill. A version of the bill the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs introduced on Nov. 1 is available here.

43768,2017-11-08,US Air Force says it didn’t report Texas shooter’s domestic violence conviction,"The U.S. Air Force said late Monday it had not reported David Kelley's 2012 conviction on domestic assault charges to the National Criminal Information Center database (NCIC). Kelley was identified as the man who shot and killed 26 people on Sunday at a church in Texas. The Air Force was required to enter the information into the NCIC database, USA Today reported, because Kelley’s conviction in a military court meant he was ineligible to purchase a gun legally under federal law. The Air Force is reviewing why the conviction was not reported, spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. 
The Pentagon's Inspector General said it would review how the Air Force handles its records, and the House Armed Services Committee announced an investigation into the matter.
The NCIC database supplies information to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is used for background checks on prospective gun buyers. People who are convicted of the “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,” or violence against a family member, are prohibited from gun purchases under the 1996 “Lautenberg Amendment” to the Gun Control Act. During the shooting, Kelley used a Ruger AR-556 rifle, bought last year in San Antonio.
In 2012, prior to his conviction in military court, Kelley had been placed in a psychiatric hospital after being charged with the assault of his wife and infant stepson. He escaped from the hospital, according to Fox News, and was then apprehended by police. He later pleaded guilty to the charges, was sentenced to one year in prison and received a “bad conduct” discharge from the Air Force.

19498,2017-11-08,Saudi-coalition says missile from Yemen is Iranian ‘aggression’; Iran denies involvement,"On Monday, the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting in Yemen said Iran was partially responsible for a missile launched at the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Saturday. Yemeni Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for Saturday’s missile aimed at the Riyadh airport, and which Saudi forces shot down. The Houthis are at war with a Saudi-led coalition, which supports the overthrown Yemen government. 

The Saudi coalition accused Iran of providing the missile to the Houthis, saying the act “constitutes a clear act of aggression” and that it “could rise to be considered as an act of war” against Saudi Arabia. Iran, which supports the Houthis politically, denied it was involved in Saturday’s attack.
Saudi Arabia’s Civil Aviation Authority said the intercepted missile, which left fragments in uninhabited land, did not cause damage to the airport. Colonel Turki al-Maliki, cited by Saudi news network SPA, said the missile was fired from within the Yemeni border at 8:07 p.m. local time, and was destroyed with a surface-to-air Patriot missile. Maliki said there were no reported casualties. On Monday, Saudi Arabia temporarily closed down land borders and air and sea ports to Yemen, which is about 620 miles (1,000 km) from Riyadh.
The Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, citing Saudi Arabian “aggression” in the form of airstrikes and civilian casualties. “The capital cities of countries that continually shell us, targeting innocent civilians, will not be spared from our missiles,” a spokesperson for the rebels said on Saturday. The Houthis said they locally produced their Volcano-variant ballistic missile.
Last week, an airstrike in Yemen that was suspected to be carried out by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 29 people. 
The Saudi-led coalition statement on Monday said examination of the missile debris “confirmed the role of Iran’s regime in manufacturing [this and a previous missile] and smuggling them to the Houthi militias in Yemen for the purpose of attacking the Kingdom, its people, and vital interests.” The coalition said Iran was violating a U.N. Security Council resolution that prohibits the sale of weapons to Yemeni armed groups.
The coalition also said Iran had “direct command” of the Houthis and that Saudi Arabia “reserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner.”
War in Yemen
The Yemeni civil war began in March 2015, when Houthi rebels overthrew President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s government in the Yemeni capital of Sana’a. Saudi Arabia then led a coalition of Sunni Arab states to fight the Houthis and attempt to reinstate Hadi’s internationally-recognized government, which reportedly retains control of the city of Aden, The Associated Press reported. The U.S. is an ally of Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim nation. Iran, a Shiite Muslim nation, says it politically supports the Houthi rebels, who are also Shiite, but denies arming them.
The war has killed more than 10,000 people, injured at least 40,000, and displaced 3 million others. Most of the deaths have been from Saudi coalition airstrikes, according to Al Jazeera.",The Facts|War and Conflict,Middle East,missile launch,Houthis,Iran|Riyadh|Saudi Arabia|Yemen,international relations,world_news,publish
43776,2017-11-09,NATO approves upgrade to its cyber defenses,"On Wednesday, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed to increase the use of cyber weaponry to protect its military communications. In its cyber defense statement, NATO mentions it recognized cyberspace as a “domain of operations” (similar to land, sea and air) in July 2016.
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the decision is a response to “a changed and new security environment where cyber is part of the threat picture.” According to AFP, NATO experiences hundreds of cyber attacks to its networks each month.
NATO defense ministers also agreed to increase the number of NATO military headquarters from seven to nine. It may also add command centers designed to protect communication lines across the Atlantic. The command centers will help to coordinate the movement of troops and equipment in Europe. 
The decision was made at a two-day meeting at NATO headquarters in Belgium this week. NATO members also plan to discuss issues relating to Russia, North Korea and Afghanistan on Thursday.

43782,2017-11-09,CBO report estimates federal deficit increase with new GOP tax bill,"On Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said the House Republicans’ tax plan would add $1.7 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. The estimate includes about $300 billion in interest. The report did not account for any economic growth that could result from the legislation.
According to a separate review by the Joint Committee on Taxation, 61 percent of taxpayers would see a tax reduction in the next two years. By 2027, the committee estimates that about one-fifth of taxpayers may pay higher taxes, 47 percent would see a tax reduction and about one-third would see a change of less than $100. Media outlets did not specify whether the estimates were based on all taxpayers or certain tax brackets.
When asked about the tax bill, Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) said House Republicans may make additional changes.
The CBO reviewed the tax bill in response to a request by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee. House Republicans are looking to pass the bill by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The Senate is reportedly developing its own tax bill.

19540,2017-11-09,How are US state governments structured?,"An election for state and local government offices was held in the U.S. on November 7, and in order to put this week's elections in context, here we explain how state governments are structured, and how they relate to the federal government.
Overall structure
Each state has its own constitution and governmental hierarchy. State governments are structured in the same way as the federal government, with executive, legislative and judicial branches. The number of elected positions in each branch may vary by state and population. Rules regarding minimum age requirements for elected positions, citizenship and residency requirements, or term limits may also vary by state.
Generally, states must abide by federal law. Although federal law supercedes state law, states may enact laws that differ or are counter to federal laws, executive orders or other federal guidelines. In such cases, the federal judiciary may take action against the state. 
State executive branch
The state governor is elected by the state’s voters to lead the executive branch. Depending on the state, people may also elect other members of the executive branch, such as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and auditors and commissioners. The state executive branch typically works independently from the federal executive branch. However, the governor may request that the president declare a federal emergency to allow the state to receive federal funding.

	Governor: As the chief executive officer of the state, governors are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing state executive branch operations. Governors can promote legislative proposals, enact executive orders and veto state legislation. Most state governors can appoint judges. All states except Oregon allow for the impeachment of governors.
	Lieutenant Governor: This is the second-highest executive office in a state and the lieutenant governor serves as governor if the governor is temporarily absent or removed from office. The position’s other powers may vary by state. In Hawaii and New Jersey, the lieutenant governor also serves as the secretary of state.
	Secretary of State (also called Secretary of the Commonwealth): Most states have this position in their executive branch; Alaska, Hawaii and Utah do not. Duties vary by state, but may include recordkeeping, the monitoring of elections and registering businesses.
	Attorney General: All 50 states have this position. The Attorney General serves as the chief legal advisor and chief law enforcement officer for the state government, and represents the state in legal matters.
	Treasurer: This position handles state finances. Some states may refer to this position as “controller.” In other states, the treasurer may handle certain duties of the comptroller or auditor (see definitions below).
	Auditor: In 48 states, the person in this position manages accounting and financial functions of the state. The state auditor can also audit other state departments and investigate fraud allegations. In some states this position may be considered part of the legislative branch rather than the executive branch.
	Superintendent: Other names for this position include superintendent of education, superintendent of public instruction or chief school administrator. This person oversees the state's elementary and secondary schools.
	Insurance Commissioner: All 50 states have an insurance commissioner that is either appointed or elected. The commissioner regulates state insurance and may include consumer protection duties.
	Comptroller: Also sometimes referred to as “controller,” the position may include duties similar to those of the treasurer, such as managing the budget.
	Agriculture Commissioner: This person manages the state’s agricultural department and enforces state agricultural regulations.
	Natural Resource Commissioner: The commissioner, in general, maintains and regulates the state’s natural resources, such as state parks, forests and recreation areas.
	Labor Commissioner: This person typically makes sure that state labor and workforce laws aren’t being violated.
	Public Service Commissioner: The public service commissioner regulates utility services such as energy, telecommunications and water.

State legislative branch
Locally elected representatives make up a state’s legislative branch. Legislative duties include creating state legislation (from matters raised by the governor or by members of the state congress), approving the state’s budget and issuing articles of impeachment. Except for Nebraska, all states have an upper chamber (the Senate) and a lower chamber (the House of Representatives). Senate legislators typically serve longer terms than House legislators. The lower chamber may also be called the House of Delegates or General Assembly. Legislators are elected from districts throughout the state. The number of legislators elected to each chamber varies by state.
Note: People who serve in a state’s Senate and House are separate from those who represent the state in the U.S. Congress. In the U.S. Senate, for example, each state has two senators representing the state, which equals a total of 100 U.S. senators in Congress. The number of U.S. House Representatives per state varies by population. The U.S. House currently has a maximum of 435 representatives.
State judicial branch
The state judicial branch is the state’s court system. The judicial branch is led by the state supreme court, which hears appeals from lower-level state courts. Since state legislators can determine a state’s court structure, the number of courts and the number of elected judges may vary by state. A state supreme court ruling is typically binding, unless the ruling is appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Local governments
Local governments can also vary by state. Some states may have local representation for counties, boroughs, parishes, municipalities, cities, towns, villages or townships. They are usually responsible for regulating parks services, police and fire departments, housing services, emergency medical services, municipal courts, transportation services (such as buses and road maintenance) and waste removal.",Context|Elections|Politics,USA,general election,Bill de Blasio|Ed Gillespie|John Curtis|Phil Murphy|Ralph Northam,New Jersey|New York|Utah|Virginia,,world_news,publish
43788,2017-11-10,US Senate committee releases tax reform bill,"The U.S. Senate Finance Committee released its version of a tax reform bill on Thursday, a week after U.S. House Republicans released their version. The Senate plan keeps certain measures that would be repealed under the House plan, such as the home mortgage interest deduction, a tax credit for adoption expenses and a deduction for people with medical expenses that exceed a percentage of their annual income. 
The Senate committee bill has seven tax brackets instead of the House’s four-bracket plan. The top tax bracket rate would be reduced to 38.5 percent, from the current top rate of 39.6 percent. It would set the standard federal deduction for every tax filer $24,000. The standard deduction is a flat amount that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows all qualified taxpayers to deduct from their annual income. Both versions call for a partial repeal of state and local income and sales taxes. According to Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND), the Senate bill would also keep existing renewable energy tax incentives, and a tax credit for electric cars.
As with the House plan, the bill reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent; unlike the House version, the senate bill would delay implementation until 2019.
The Senate Finance Committee plans to vote on the measure on Nov. 13 next week, with a full Senate vote scheduled for December. The committee’s bill can be found here.

43791,2017-11-10,US sanctions 10 Venezuelan officials,"The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned 10 current and former Venezuelan government officials on Thursday. The OFAC alleges that the officials tampered with Venezuela’s Oct. 15 state elections in favor of President Nicolás Maduro’s “United Socialist Party of Venezuela.” The office also alleged that the officials relocated polling stations without adequate notice, limited freedom of the press, and profited from corruption in Venezuela's food program.
The elections “were marked by numerous irregularities that strongly suggest fraud helped the ruling party unexpectedly win a majority of governorship,” according to a statement by the OFAC.
The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with the Venezuelan officials, and freezes all their assets “subject to U.S. jurisdiction.”
The OFAC expanded on the sanctions originally imposed on Venezuela via Executive Order 13692, which was signed in March 2015 by former President Barack Obama. The order allows the Treasury to take actions against Venezuelan government officials who have committed corruption or acts considered a “violation of human rights.” Thursday’s sanctions represent the fifth time the Treasury has sanctioned Venezuelans this year.

43794,2017-11-10,Saudi Arabia says 201 people held in embezzlement investigation,"On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said it is holding 201 people for questioning in an embezzlement and corruption investigation. A statement by Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said the government had originally held 208 people, and had released seven without charges. 
“Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100 billion has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades,” the statement said. 
Al-Mojeb said the suspects’ bank accounts have been frozen. According to AFP, assets connected to the corruption cases may be seized as state property. Princes, ministers and businessmen were arrested last Saturday as part of the corruption investigation, and have been held since. 
Regarding the identities of those detained, Mojeb said, “In order to ensure that the individuals continue to enjoy the full legal rights afforded to them under Saudi law, we will not be revealing any more personal details at this time.”
Human Rights Watch, a nongovernmental organization, requested that Saudi officials disclose the ""legal and evidentiary basis"" for each person's detention.

According to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the island’s power generation had been at 43.2 percent of its capacity on Thursday morning. That rate reduced to 18 percent after the transmission line failure.
The failure took place on a transmission line that runs from Cambalache to Manatí, according to the Puerto Rican energy authority’s Twitter account. NBC News reported that line had previously been repaired by Whitefish Energy, a Montana-based company that was contracted to restore power on the island. Whitefish said Thursday’s line failure was not tied to its previous work on the line. In October, Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, canceled the $300 million Whitefish contract.  
Puerto Rican authorities say service may be restored to some of the affected areas in about 12 to 18 hours.

43814,2017-11-15,FDA approves pill with ingestion tracking device,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a pill containing an ingestion tracking device on Monday. The device was developed by Proteus Digital Health and can inform healthcare workers when the medicine is taken by the patient. The tracking sensor is currently being used in a drug called Abilify, which is produced by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and some forms of depression. The Abilify tablets were the first pills with an embedded tracking sensor to be approved by the FDA.
The tracking device is about the size of a grain of salt. It is activated when it comes into contact with liquid in the a patient’s stomach. When this happens, the device produces a small electric charge, which allows it to transmit ingestion information to a cellphone app via a patch worn by the patient. Doctors and caregivers, with permission, can use this information to track the patient’s medication usage online.

Article 112 of Norway’s constitution states, “Every person has a right to an environment that is conducive to health and to natural surroundings whose productivity and diversity are preserved.”

Norway’s Attorney General said the suit could result in “hundreds of thousands of” people losing their jobs.

The Los Angeles Times reports that Liu Yunshan, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, met with Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in 2015. In October 2016, the country’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin also visited Pyongyang. These are reportedly the last ministerial-level Chinese officials to have visited North Korea.
On Sept. 11, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to pass new sanctions on North Korea following its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3. China, North Korea’s main trading partner, has said it will enforce the latest round of U.N. sanctions, which could reduce the country’s export revenue by $1 billion, according to the L.A. Times. The sanctions are to take effect in January.

19779,2017-11-16,7.8M Australians vote for same-sex marriage in nationwide postal poll,"Results from a nationwide postal poll showed that 7.8 million Australians support the legalization of same-sex marriage. The results represent 61.6 percent of the more than 12.7 million people who participated in the voluntary survey. The Guardian notes the “record-high” turnout represents close to 80 percent of the 16 million Australians on the electoral roll. 
The Australian Parliament has begun debate on the issue. If approved, the government would amend Australia’s Constitution to legally recognize the unions of gay and lesbian couples. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who voted “yes,” has promised a vote on legalizing same-sex marriage before Christmas. After the results were announced, Turnbull said, “My commitment was to give every Australian their say. That has been done, they have spoken.”

19776,2017-11-16,"Zimbabwe military detains Mugabe, seizes control of government","On Wednesday, Zimbabwe’s military said it had seized control of the government after it had detained President Robert Mugabe and his family the previous day. Armored vehicles and soldiers were reportedly sent to the capital on street patrols. Both the military and the ruling ZANU-PF party have said the actions do not constitute a coup. In a tweet, ZANU-PF described the events as a “bloodless transition which saw corrupt and crooked persons being arrested.”
The events follow the dismissal of First Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Nov. 6. Mnangagwa, 75, left the country two days later citing death threats. On Wednesday, ZANU-PF tweeted announcing the appointment of Mnangagwa as the party’s interim president.
The military has said Mugabe and his family are “safe and sound and their security is guaranteed.” Mugabe, 93, has ruled Zimbabwe as president or prime minister since 1980. He has been under U.S. sanctions since 2001 for alleged human rights abuses and alleged evidence of electoral fraud. He has also been under sanctions by the EU since 2002.
The African Union called on all sides to “respect Zimbabwe’s democracy and human rights,” according to NPR.

19842,2017-11-17,"210,000 gallons of oil leaked from Keystone Pipeline in South Dakota","The Keystone Pipeline leaked 210,000 gallons of oil in Marshall County, South Dakota, before it was shut down, the state and the pipeline’s operator said on Thursday. TransCanada, the Canadian-based oil company that operates the pipeline, shut down the affected sections, and officials are investigating the cause of the leak. 
TransCanada said in a statement that the pipeline was shut off between Hardisty, Alberta, and Cushing, Oklahoma, and to Wood River and Pakota, Illinois. The company said a drop in pressure was detected and the affected area of the pipeline was isolated within 15 minutes. 
A spokesman for the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Brian Walsh, said this was the largest leak to date from the pipeline. It leaked 16,800 gallons in April 2016. Walsh said the current leak occurred about three miles southwest of Amherst in an agricultural area away from bodies of water. 
The leak was from a “below-ground pipeline but some oil has surfaced above ground to the grass,” he said. Walsh added that it would be a few days until they could “excavate and get in borings to see if there is groundwater contamination.”

19840,2017-11-17,Judge declares mistrial in Menendez corruption case,"U.S. District Judge William Walls declared a mistrial on Thursday in the corruption case against Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), when the case resulted in a deadlocked jury. The jury of seven women and five men could not reach a consensus on the 18 charges, which included conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has not announced whether it would retry Menendez. A DOJ spokesperson said prosecutors would consider next steps and “report to the Court at the appropriate time.”
Prosecutors alleged that Menendez granted “political favors” to his friend Dr. Salomon Melgen, an ophthalmologist, in exchange for campaign donations of more than $600,000, flights on private jets and hotel stays. Both Menendez and Melgen, who was on trial for bribery, deny the allegations. The alleged “favors” included attempts to help Melgen gain U.S. visas for his girlfriends, to help the doctor with a Medicare billing dispute worth $8.9 million, and to aid in a port security contract between Melgen and the Dominican Republic. 
During Menendez’s trial, his defense argued that the senator had gotten involved in the the Medicare issue because the billing policies were inconsistent and benefited drug companies. The defense also said Menendez had been involved in the port security contract as part of his general interest in port security. 
Melgen was previously convicted of defrauding Medicare and is awaiting sentencing.
Menendez’s trial lasted 11 weeks and included 57 witnesses. According to one juror, Ed Norris, the jury was divided 10-2 on the last vote in favor of acquittal.

19837,2017-11-17,"US lifts 2014 ban on importing elephant parts from Zimbabwe, Zambia","On Thursday, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) reversed a ban on importing elephant parts from Zimbabwe and Zambia into the U.S. The FWS first introduced the ban on elephant parts in 2014 during the Obama administration. Elephants are listed as “endangered” under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and the governments of Zimbabwe and Zambia governments allow the hunting of them on a limited basis. 
“Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,” a FWS spokesperson said in a statement.
The Federal Register is scheduled to post a notice of the change in policy this Friday, according to ABC News. The post would contain information about FWS’ reasons for the change. 
In October, the FWS removed a ban on lion parts from Zimbabwe and Zambia, saying that lion trophy hunting in those countries met its criteria to possibly “enhance the survival” of lions in the wild. FWS says it will re-evaluate lion hunting programs in the two countries in mid-2018.
UPDATE: On Friday, President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that the government would uphold the 2014 ban, pending further review. He tweeted: ""Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!""

19835,2017-11-17,Bipartisan US senators introduce bill incentivizing firearm background check reporting,"On Thursday, senators introduced a bipartisan bill that would provide incentives for federal departments and agencies to uphold a 2007 law requiring them to provide data to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX.), who co-sponsored the bill, reports on his website that the bill would provide “federal grant preferences and incentives” to agencies that provide plans for updating the NICS system with mental health and criminal records, including domestic violence records.
Earlier this month, 26 people were shot dead at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The alleged perpetrator had been convicted of domestic violence in a military court years earlier; the Air Force did not report his record to NICS. With that conviction, he was ineligible to purchase a gun under federal law.
“For years agencies and states haven’t complied with the law, failing to upload these critical records without consequence,” Sen. Cornyn said. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT.) added that the bill would “strengthen the background check system.”
Cornyn, Murphy, three other Democrats and three other Republicans authored the “Fix NICS Act.” The bill also includes an accountability measure for government agencies to report records to NICS. If the agency fails to do so, bonuses could be withheld from political appointees involved in the process.
In 1995, the National Criminal History Improvement Program came into effect, and in 2007 the NICS Improvement Amendments Act was implemented. Both laws incentivize states to enter records into a firearm background check system. The National Rifle Association (NRA) said it won’t oppose the new bill.

19833,2017-11-17,US tax reform bill passes in the House,"On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed its tax reform bill by a vote of 227 to 205. No Democrats voted for the bill, called the “Tax Cut and Jobs Act,” and 13 Republicans voted against it. The Senate has yet to pass its own version of a tax reform bill. If it does, both chambers of Congress would then have to reconcile the bills before the legislation would be sent to the president for his signature.
The Senate has its own version of a tax reform bill. In its current form, it would remove a requirement of the Affordable Care Act, also called “Obamacare,” that requires individuals to purchase health insurance or be subject to a financial penalty. The House version does not contain that provision.
The 440-page House bill, which was first introduced Nov. 2, includes provisions to: 

	reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent.
	reduce the number of individual tax brackets from seven to four.
	repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which currently sets a minimum payable tax to higher income people by limiting deductions.
	repeal the electric car tax incentive.
	eliminate personal exemptions of $4,050.
	increase the standard individual deduction from $6,350 to $12,000. The standard deduction is the base amount of income that is not taxable. 
	repeal the estate tax by 2024.
	repeal deductions for medical expenses, tax preparation fees, alimony payments, student loan interest and moving expenses.
	implement a 9 percent tax rate on the first $75,000 of taxable income for people making $150,000 or less in “pass through” small businesses, to be phased-in through 2022. (“Pass-throughs” are businesses where the income “passes through” to the owner(s) and is taxed as individual income for that owner(s) rather than as income for a business, such as is the case for C-corporations. According to the Brookings Institute, in 2014, there were 26 million registered businesses in total, and about 95 percent of them were pass-throughs.)

19881,2017-11-18,A recent history of US gun control legislation,"The U.S. Congress is currently considering multiple gun control bills, not all of which are listed here. As lawmakers consider these bills, it may be helpful to take stock of the various gun control laws that have been passed over the past 30 years, or recently introduced. Here’s a brief timeline.
As lawmakers consider these bills, it may be helpful to take stock of the various gun control laws that have been passed over the past 30 years, or recently introduced. Here’s a brief timeline:
Nov. 10, 1988: Undetectable Firearms Act prohibits the manufacture, import, sale, shipment, delivery, possession or transfer of any firearm that may not be detectable by walk-through metal detectors.
Nov. 29, 1990: The Crime Control Act of 1990 increases penalties for people who commit certain crimes using “short-barreled rifles or shotguns or destructive devices.” It also prohibits the transfer of guns to residents across state lines, and amends the Federal criminal code to impose criminal penalties against citizens who possess or discharge a gun in a school zone.
Nov. 30, 1993: The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act establishes rules for buying guns, such as background checks and five-day waiting periods. The waiting periods provision expired five years later.
Sept. 13, 1994: The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorizes the use of the death penalty for certain gun-related crimes. It prohibits the possession of a gun or ammunition by a minor, with some exceptions. It allows for enhanced penalties for crimes involving guns and revises the definition for “armor piercing ammunition.” It also temporarily prohibits the manufacture and sale of “semiautomatic assault weapons;” the prohibition ends in 2004. 
Nov. 13, 1998: “A bill to throttle criminal use of guns,” S.191, increases mandatory minimum prison sentences for people who use guns during certain crimes, such as drug offenses.
Nov. 30, 1998: The FBI establishes the NICS database in 1998, as mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. Since then, more than 230 million background checks have been performed resulting in more than 1.3 million denials of firearms purchases, according to the FBI.
Oct. 26, 2005: The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act prohibits people from filing a civil suit against a manufacturer or seller of a “firearm, ammunition, or a component of a firearm, though some exclusions apply.” It also prohibits gun sales and gun transfers to people without gun licenses “unless the transferee is provided with a secure gun storage or safety devices.” Some exceptions apply.
Jan. 8, 2008: The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 to add incentives for states to provide information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).
Oct. 19, 2017: Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) introduces a bill that would effectively ban the sale and manufacture of bump stocks and devices that are designed and function “to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle but … not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun.” The bill currently has 37 cosponsors: 19 Republicans and 18 Democrats. (Bill is currently under consideration.)
Oct. 25, 2017: Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) introduces a bill titled “Background Check Expansion Act,” which would require background checks for all gun purchases, including private gun sales. The bill currently has 35 cosponsors: 1 Independent and 34 Democrats. (Bill is currently under consideration.)
Oct. 31, 2017: Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) introduces a bill entitled “Closing the Bump-Stock Loophole Act.” The bill has five cosponsors: one Republican and four Democrats. According to The Hill, the legislation would require owners and people wanting to purchase bump stocks to register with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, be background checked, fingerprinted and pay a $200 registration fee. The bill currently has 7 cosponsors: 1 Republican and 6 Democrats. (Bill is currently under consideration.)
Mar. 23, 2018: The president signs the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018,” which includes the “Fix NICS Act” that contains incentives such as grants and penalties for government agencies to report records to NICS. (The acronym stands for “National Instant Criminal Background Check System.”) The Fix NICS Act also creates a “Domestic Abuse and Violence Prevention Initiative” that “emphasizes the need for grantees to identify and upload all felony conviction records and domestic violence records.” (In 1995, the National Criminal History Improvement Program came into effect, and in 2007 the NICS Improvement Amendments Act was implemented. Both laws incentivize states to enter records into a firearm background check system. The National Rifle Association says it won’t oppose the new bill.)
Mar. 23, 2018: The president signs the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018,” which also includes the “STOP School Violence Act of 2018.” The latter act allocates grant money to states for training and “evidence-based strategies and programs to prevent violence,” such as using metal detectors and “emergency notification and response technologies.” ",Context|Politics|War and Conflict,USA,bill,NICS,Washington,firearms|gun control|Senate|senators,world_news,publish
19924,2017-11-20,Scientific paper predicts increase in ‘major’ earthquakes in 2018,"U.S. scientists predicted that there would be an increase in the number of large earthquakes in 2018 due to a slowing of the Earth’s rotation. The study analyzed earthquakes since 1900 that measured at least 7 on the Richter scale and found that periods of greater seismic activity followed five-year periods when the earth’s rotation slowed by as little as a millisecond. The last such slowdown, which the study’s coauthor said is “very accurately” measured by atomic clocks, began four years ago.
Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana published their findings earlier this year and presented it at the annual Geological Society of America meeting last month. 
Following the periods of slowed rotation of the earth, “there were between 25 to 30 intense earthquakes a year,” compared to an average of 15 “major” quakes per year, Bilham told The Guardian. He said, “the inference is clear,” and that next year “we should see a significant increase in numbers of severe earthquakes.”
Bilham said that most of the earthquakes during the previous periods of slower rotation occurred in tropical regions near the equator.

19922,2017-11-20,Search continues for missing Argentine submarine,"A search continued on Sunday for an Argentine submarine with 44 crewmembers aboard that went missing three days prior. Argentina’s defense ministry said on Sunday that seven unsuccessful calls to various naval bases were suspected to be from the lost vessel.
The calls were placed between 10:52 a.m. and 3:42 p.m. Saturday, the ministry said. “The calls are being analyzed, but we do not have clear evidence that they came from that unit,” said Gabriel Gonzales, who is from the Mar del Plata naval base and in charge of search operations.
The area had waves of up to 26 feet (8m) and winds of up to 40 knots on Sunday, and Gonzales said that a storm was making the search difficult. “Unfortunately these conditions are expected to remain for the next 48 hours,” he said.
The ARA San Juan submarine was last seen in the San Jorge Gulf, a few hundred kilometers off the coast of southern Argentina. The vessel is 213 feet (65 m) and powered by one electric and four diesel engines, the Argentine military said. Protocol is for a submarine to surface if it loses communication, Reuters reported.
The U.S., the U.K., Chile and Brazil have sent ships and aircraft to aid in the search.

19918,2017-11-20,Palestinians say they’ll suspend communication with the US if PLO diplomatic mission closes,"Palestinians said on Saturday that they would suspend all communications with the United States if it closed the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington. The State Department announced on Friday that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) cannot operate an office in Washington if Palestinians attempt to have the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecute Israelis for crimes against Palestinians. According to anonymous State Department officials, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson determined that the Palestinians had done so at the United Nations in September when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on the court to investigate Israelis.
The U.S. does not recognize the Palestinian territories as a state, but has allowed the PLO, which formally represents Palestinians, to maintain a diplomatic mission in the U.S. since 1994. U.S. law contains a provision that prohibits the PLO from operating the office if it supports the ICC investigating and prosecuting Israelis for alleged crimes against Palestinians, the Associated Press reports. The law allows the mission to remain open if Palestinians are engaged in “direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.” It does not specify what it determines to be “direct and meaningful.” U.S. President Donald Trump now has 90 days to determine if the Palestinians are engaged in such dialogue.
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians “will put on hold all our communications with this American administration” if the decision moves forward. Erekat said the decision was the result of Israeli pressure on the U.S., and called it “unacceptable.”
The Trump administration did not immediately respond. Prior to the PLO response, U.S. officials had said the decision was a matter of law and was not intended to increase leverage over Palestinians in negotiations towards peace with Israel.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the U.S. had told him that the State Department would meet with legal teams on Monday to decide how the decision would affect the Palestinians’ diplomatic office in Washington, the diplomats and contact with Palestinians.

19916,2017-11-20,"Zimbabwe's Mugabe gives televised speech, does not resign as president","Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe did not announce he would resign during a televised address on Sunday, hours after the ruling party fired him as party leader and said it would impeach him if he did not step down. Mugabe delivered the speech from his residence in Harare, where he’s been under house arrest since the military took control of the government on Nov. 14 and 15. He was surrounded by military generals.
“The congress is due in a few weeks from now. I will preside over its processes, which must not be possessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public,” Mugabe said.
On Nov. 6, Mugabe fired Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Then on Wednesday, the military announced that it had taken control of the government and the state broadcaster, and had detained Mugabe and his family the previous day. During his speech, Mugabe said, “Whatever the pros and cons of how [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns.” He did not say the army had violated the constitution.
Earlier on Sunday, the ruling Zanu-PF party’s Central Committee met and fired Mugabe, 93, as the leader of the party. It said Mugabe had until Monday at noon local time to announce his resignation as president or be subject to impeachment proceedings. Impeaching the president requires a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of parliament, BBC reported.
Zanu-PF named Mnangagwa, the former vice president, as the new party leader and its candidate for the 2018 elections. Zanu-PF also expelled Mugabe’s wife Grace, 52, from the party and dismissed her as head of the women's league. She has not been seen in public since her husband was placed under house arrest.
There were protests calling for Mugabe’s resignation on Saturday in the capital. BBC reported that tens of thousands of demonstrators attended. Mugabe has led Zimbabwe for the 37 years since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.

19959,2017-11-21,Filling in the gaps on Mugabe and Zimbabwe,"What's going on in Zimbabwe with Robert Mugabe? We fill in some of these gaps below, with information about the leader’s career and the numerous allegations against him and his government. We also give context about Zimbabwe’s government, how the president is elected, limits on presidential terms and laws governing a president's removal from office—all information that is especially pertinent given recent events. 
Who is Robert Mugabe?
Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born in 1924 in what was then southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. He trained as a teacher and taught abroad in Ghana in the late 1950s. He returned to Zimbabwe in 1960, and in 1963 helped form the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) party. In 1964, he was accused of subversive speech and spent the next 10 years in jail. 
In the late 1970s, Mugabe was part of a movement fighting against British rule in Rhodesia. The fight led to democratic elections being called, and in 1980 Mugabe was elected prime minister of Zimbabwe for the ZANU-PF party. He became president in 1987 after changes to the constitution created an executive presidency, in which the president is directly responsible for the government and the armed forces.
Mugabe was re-elected as president in 1990, 1996, 2002, 2008 and 2013. In the 2008 elections, Mugabe lost the first round to opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. According to the official results, none of the candidates achieved more than 50 percent, prompting a second round of voting. In the weeks leading up to the run-off, Tsvangirai and other opposition candidates were arrested, and foreign diplomats investigating reports of election-related violence were also detained. In the end, Tsvangirai withdrew from the race, saying that a free and fair election wasn’t possible due to intimidation and violence. The election was still held and Mugabe was declared the winner.
After international intervention and negotiations, Zimbabwe’s constitution was amended (though not officially adopted until 2013), allowing for a power-sharing government with Mugabe as president and Tsvangirai as prime minister. The prime minister’s position was abolished again in 2013 and replaced with two vice-presidents.
Some of the allegations of fraud from the last couple of elections include accusations of “systematic efforts to disenfranchise an estimated one million voters,” from the Zimbabwe Election Support Network. The Network says this resulted in 99.97 percent of rural voters being registered, as opposed to 67.94 percent of urban voters for the 2013 election. Zimbabwe’s opposition has the strongest following in urban areas.
What is Mugabe accused of?
Economy
Zimbabwe’s opposition and international organizations like United Nations Watch and the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) have said Mugabe’s government has had a negative effect on Zimbabwe’s economy and healthcare system, with the opposition saying it has “collapse[d]” during his rule. While it is true that Zimbabwe’s economy (as measured by GDP) decreased from $8.54 billion in 1982 to $4.42 billion in 2008, it has since increased to $16.3 billion in 2016. However, in terms of GDP per capita, it’s still lower in 2016 than in 1982.
One of the ways Mugabe has been linked directly to the country’s economic issues is through his program of land reforms. This program, adopted in 2000, saw land owned by white farmers designated for compulsory acquisition and seized by squatters; a sometimes violent practice that killed several farmers. This allegedly caused a reduction in Zimbabwe’s agricultural production, which before the reforms earned 45 percent of the country’s foreign exchange revenue. Zimbabwe’s trade balance decreased from plus 3.7 percent in 2000 to minus 16.8 percent in 2004, according to the OECD.
Personal spending
Mugabe has also been criticized for spending excessive money on birthday celebrations (about $1 million on his 90th) and on travels abroad for health check-ups. Zambian newspaper Financial Gazette, citing Zimbabwean Treasury figures, reports he spent $53 million on foreign trips in 2016, while Zimbabwe had a budget deficit of $1.4 billion in the same year.
Human rights abuses
HRW reports Zimbabwe is repressing peaceful protests and allowing its police to use excessive force to stop protests. It has also reported violations of the rights of opposition members, journalists and activists. In its 2017 World Report, HRW cites a speech in which Mugabe called Zimbabwe’s judges “reckless” for issuing rulings allowing protests against his government. It also mentions a different speech in which Mugabe called the chair of Zimbabwe’s Human Rights Commission “stupid,” and he dismissed as “absolutely false” a report finding the government had denied food aid to opposition supporters.
What sanctions are imposed on Zimbabwe?
A number of countries and international organizations have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe. In 2002, the E.U. issued sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes for Mugabe, his wife Grace Mugabe, and around 200 other persons and entities with ties to Zimbabwe’s military and political establishment. The sanctions, which have been amended twice since 2002, also ban the sale and transfer of arms and other military related materials. The sanctions were imposed over the aforementioned land reform program.
The U.S. State and Treasury Departments first imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe in 2001. These also include economic restrictions, travel bans, and a ban on the sale of defense items and services. The Treasury cited concerns over the “actions and policies of certain members of the government of Zimbabwe and other persons undermining democratic institutions or processes in Zimbabwe” for its sanctions.
Zimbabwe’s elections
The Zimbabwe government established its current constitution in 2013. Under the constitution:

	The term of office for the president extends until he or she resigns, is removed from office, or a new president is elected.
	A term is limited to five years and a president can serve up to two terms. Note: Prior to 2013, there was no limit on how long a president could remain in office, and the new rules did not apply retroactively to Mugabe. As a result, Mugabe could technically remain as president until 2023.
	The president is elected by registered voters in Zimbabwe.
	The next election will take place in 2018.

Zimbabwe’s government
The constitution allows for up to 350 members of parliament. Parliament has up to 80 members in the Senate and 270 members in the National Assembly.
Zimbabwe’s parliament has two primary political parties: Mugabe’s ZanuPF, which holds the majority, and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). According to the parliament website, ZanuPF holds 57 seats, MDC has 27 seats, and there are an unspecified number of seats for parties listed under “other.”
How to remove a sitting president
A president either resigns, dies or is removed from office, at which point the first vice president assumes the role of the presidency. For this section, “removal” does not include losing reelection.
Resignation: The president may resign from office by written notice to the National Assembly Speaker, who then must give public notice of the resignation within twenty-four hours.
Removal: The Senate and the National Assembly must pass a joint resolution by at least one-half of their total membership declaring the reason for the president’s removal. The president can be removed for the following reasons:

	Serious misconduct.

If the resolution passes (or if half of the Senate and National Assembly agree on the reason for removing the president), the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders then appoints a nine-member joint committee of Senate and National Assembly members to investigate the president’s removal. The nine-member committee decides whether the president should be removed from office. If it recommends removal, then the Senate and the National Assembly must pass a joint resolution by at least two-thirds of their total membership in favor of removing the president.",Context|Politics|War and Conflict|World,Africa,speech,Robert Mugabe,Zimbabwe,impeachment|resignation,world_news,publish
19937,2017-11-21,Kenya’s Supreme Court upholds re-election of President Kenyatta,"Kenya’s Supreme Court ruled Monday that two petitions challenging the result of last month’s repeat presidential election were “without merit.” The court’s decision was unanimous. As a consequence of the ruling, President Uhuru Kenyatta can now be sworn in for a second term on Nov. 28. Under Kenya’s constitution, his second term as president will also be his last. Kenyatta won the election on Oct. 26 with 98 percent of the vote; turnout was 39 percent.
The petitions had argued that the election results “should be voided because the election board did not seek fresh nominations after the earlier Aug. 8 poll was invalidated, and because the vote was not held in each of Kenya’s 291 voter constituencies,” according to Reuters.
The Supreme Court had annulled the result of the original Aug. 8 presidential election, and called for a re-election. Kenyatta won the original election by nine percentage points, with an 80 percent turnout. The court cited irregularities and mismanagement by the electoral commission in its decision. Opposition leader Raila Odinga later withdrew from the race, saying the problems that led to the first election’s annulment had not been addressed. Violent confrontations between protesters and police after both elections have killed 60 people over the last three months.

19940,2017-11-21,Residents of Greek island strike in protest of EU immigration policy,"Residents of the Greek island of Lesbos participated in a 24-hour strike Monday to protest EU immigration policy, which they say has turned the island into a “prison” for migrants and refugees. Businesses, shops, government offices and nurseries were closed while protesters gathered on the island’s Sappho square. They called for asylum seekers to be transferred to the mainland.
Lesbos is located off the Turkish coast. In 2015, nearly one million refugees and immigrants, mainly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, reached the island on their way to seek asylum in Europe. The island currently houses 8,500 asylum seekers in facilities designed to hold no more than 3,000, according to Reuters. Many of them have become stranded on Lesbos and four other Greek islands after a 2016 immigration deal between the EU and Turkey. The deal shut down the route refugees took through Greece to travel into Europe from the Middle East.
According to Reuters, human rights groups have described the conditions in the refugee camps as “deplorable and unfit for humans.” The U.N.’s refugee agency has said many refugees are living ""in small tents and shelters unsuitable for the winter.”

19939,2017-11-21,Turkish capital bans LGBT cultural events,"The governor of Turkey’s capital Ankara announced Sunday night that all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) related events would be banned until further notice, citing concerns that they could “provoke hatred and hostility,” and interfere with “public security.” The ban includes film festivals, exhibitions, forums and interviews.
Governor Mehmet Kiliclar said in a statement that LGBT events were being banned due to “social sensitivities.” His office added that the ban would help promote “public order, prevention of crime, general health and morals.” 
Two Turkish gay rights groups described the ban as “illegal,” discriminatory” and “arbitrary.” Homosexuality is legal in Turkey, and has been since the republic was created in 1923.
The annual LGBT Pride parade in Istanbul was cancelled in June for the third consecutive year. Police used tear gas and fired rubber bullets at protesters who took to the streets despite the cancellation.

19936,2017-11-21,Trump to designate North Korea as state sponsor of terrorism,"On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. Trump said the designation will result in additional sanctions on North Korea and “related persons,” and that the Treasury Department would begin to announce them on Tuesday. The U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list also contains Iran, Sudan and Syria.
U.S. officials have mentioned the assassination of Kim Jong Un’s estranged half-brother in Malaysia as one example of terrorism in which North Korea has allegedly participated.
During a press briefing Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the designation is part of “continuing to turn this pressure up ... on North Korea,” and that he hoped it will “disrupt and dissuade” certain actors from doing business with the North.
North Korea was originally removed from the list in 2008 as part of a deal to end the country’s nuclear program.

20001,2017-11-22,Nebraska approves Keystone XL pipeline route,"On Monday, Nebraska's Public Service Commission approved a planned Keystone XL oil pipeline route through the state, voting 3-2 in favor of the project. The commission approved an alternate route to the one proposed by TransCanada, the company in charge of the project. The decision is subject to appeal and TransCanada said it will review how the decision might impact the cost and schedule of the project.
The existing Keystone pipeline system connects the oil sands in Alberta, Canada, to U.S. refineries in Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas. The Keystone XL project will expand the existing system with a 1,179-mile pipeline between Hardisty, Alberta, and Steele City, Nebraska.
The project, first proposed in 2008, is estimated to cost $8 billion and would carry about 830,000 barrels of oil a day, according to The Associated Press. In 2015, then President Barack Obama rejected the pipeline on environmental grounds. President Donald Trump reversed that decision in March this year.

19998,2017-11-22,US to end Temporary Protected Status residency program for Haiti,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Monday that a provisional residency program for Haitians, known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), will not be renewed when it expires in January of next year. Haitians with TPS will be given 18 months from the expiry date to arrange their departure or legalize their status in the United States. The DHS said in a statement that the “extraordinary conditions” which led to the status being given in the first place “no longer exists.”
TPS was granted to 59,000 Haitians after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in 2010 happened near the country’s capital, killing 300,000 people, according to White House administration officials. Earlier this year, the DHS also announced that TPS for Nicaraguans and Sudanese would not be renewed.

19996,2017-11-22,California judge blocks executive order to limit funds for 'sanctuary cities',"U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick for the Northern District of California issued a permanent injunction on Monday barring an executive order that called for withholding federal funds from “sanctuary cities,” or jurisdictions that do not comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 – legislation that, among other things, requires local and state governments to provide federal authorities with information about the immigration status of any individual.
The injunction followed lawsuits brought by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County against the federal government. Orrick previously ruled on these suits in April and issued a preliminary injunction, which was appealed by the Justice Department in September.
In his ruling on Monday, Orrick said the executive order was unconstitutional because it violated “the separation of powers doctrine” and deprived the counties “of their Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights.” The injunction prevents the White House administration from imposing new conditions on how the cities spend funding that Congress has already approved for their use.
The Center for Immigration Studies reported that around 300 jurisdictions (such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago) rejected more than 17,000 detention requests from federal immigration authorities between January 2014 and September 2015.

19992,2017-11-22,Robert Mugabe resigns as president of Zimbabwe,"Robert Mugabe resigned as president of Zimbabwe on Tuesday. Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda read out a letter from Mugabe during a session of parliament, in which Mugabe said his resignation was voluntary, and that he had resigned to allow for a “smooth transfer of power.” 
According to Zimbabwe’s constitution, the first vice president would normally become interim leader. However, Mugabe fired first Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Nov. 6, and he has not been seen in Zimbabwe since. In his absence, the constitution says second Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko should assume office.
Mugabe, 93, has been president of Zimbabwe since its independence from Britain in 1980. He has not been seen in public since Sunday when he gave a televised speech. On Sunday, Mugabe’s party ZANU-PF removed him as leader, and appointed Mnangagwa in his place.

20026,2017-11-23,"5 countries to investigate Uber’s 2016 data breach, response","The U.S., U.K., Italy, Australia and the Philippines announced Wednesday they would investigate Uber Technologies, Inc.’s 2016 data breach and the company’s response to it. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said it was “evaluating the serious issues raised” by the loss of data and reported response. Attorneys general in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York also said they would investigate the ride-hailing service’s handling of the matter.
Dara Khosrowshahi became Uber’s CEO in September after Travis Kalanick left that role in June. On Tuesday, Khosrowshahi said in a post on Uber’s website that two individuals had accessed company data on a third-party server. They allegedly stole the names, email addresses and phone numbers of 57 million users, and names and driver’s license numbers of 600,000 U.S. Uber drivers. The company said it paid the individuals who stole the data $100,000 to destroy it. It had not notified regulators or those affected when it learned of the stolen data in October 2016.
Khosrowshahi said Uber was individually notifying drivers whose data was stolen, and providing them with free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. Uber said it had fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, and his deputy, Craig Clark.
Some drivers in California, whose data was stolen, have started a class-action lawsuit.

20034,2017-11-23,Net neutrality: What is it and why do people care?,"Have you read news coverage of the “net neutrality” issue and then still wondered what it is exactly? If so, you’re not alone. Below, we provide an overview of the concept and arguments for an against it. 
What is net neutrality?
“Net neutrality” refers to the concept that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the internet equally. The U.S. has had regulations in place on net neutrality since 2015. 
What does this mean? Data on the internet travels through ISPs (such as Verizon or Comcast) to consumers who purchase their internet service. Some activity on the internet, such as streaming videos, require more data usage than other types, such as email or surfing the web. With net neutrality in place, the ISPs cannot slow down or block delivery of larger file types, or charge more for them. 
The ISPs also cannot discriminate either for or against certain content providers, under net neutrality rules. For example, if an ISP company has its own video streaming service, it could not offer that service for free while charging additional money to stream from independent companies such as Netflix or Hulu. 
Without net neutrality in place, ISPs would be allowed to charge more for certain types of services, or tiers of data usage. They could offer cheaper plans for people who, for instance, only want to access email and a browser, and more for people who stream videos or upload content. 
What net neutrality isn’t
Net neutrality refers to the type of data and does not directly relate to the messages within that data. In other words, if there was no net neutrality, an ISP could block, charge more for or slow down video files compared to text files, but not take action based on what’s in those videos. ISPs would not be allowed to prioritize or disfavor political content, by, for instance, slowing down or charging more for content associated with a particular political party or ideology. (Note that some people argue that content could be indirectly influenced if ISPs are allowed to prioritize certain file types or content from companies owned by the ISPs.)
If there were no net neutrality and there were tiered internet service plans, theoretically people who paid for the highest tiers could access any content available online without slowdowns or blocks.  
What are some arguments in favor of net neutrality?
The main arguments for the government enforcing net neutrality have to do with counteracting large ISPs monopolies on the market, the promotion of tech entrepreneurship, and the promotion of equal access to information.
Since most people use the internet in many aspects of their lives, it is deemed an essential service. As the argument goes, because there are only a few large ISP companies to choose from, they have a lot of power to set and control prices. If there were no net neutrality, ISPs could create financial barriers for people to access types of internet content. They could also create “zero rating” plans that offer free sponsored content, influencing what people of limited means can access.
Some argue that this could discourage tech entrepreneurship by discriminating against companies that don’t have the resources to enter into deals with the ISPs to have their content prioritized. In other words, in an extreme case a new tech company could launch but very few people would have access to it.
Additionally, some argue that limited access to certain types of content could affect educational opportunities for lower-income people. Educational and training videos are often currently available on the internet for free, and people argue this can help narrow the education gap.
What are some arguments against net neutrality?
The main arguments against net neutrality tend to center around either free market solutions (anti-regulation), its effect on investment, fair pay-for-use pricing, or the concept of a sponsor-subsidized internet to increase access to those with fewer economic means.
First, some people argue that there should be minimal government regulation of industries like tech in general. The assumption here is that the market regulates itself and encourages the most competitive pricing models. If a company overcharges, as long as there is some alternative, its business will suffer and it will be forced to reduce prices. 
Others argue that the U.S. government is too powerful and its oversight of the public’s consumption of internet content should be limited. (For instance, Glenn Greenwald alleges that the government already interferes with the manufacture of internet routers exported to China to install tools for spying.) 
Some net neutrality opponents, including FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, argue that net neutrality discourages ISPs from investing in their networks or their own services like video streaming.
Some people also suggest it is fairer to have people pay for what they use. If a person downloads or uploads Gigabytes worth of data and uses more of the ISP’s bandwidth than a typical user, the argument is they should pay more. This would be similar to a person who uses more electricity and therefore has a higher bill than neighbors who use less.
Finally, an IEEE paper concluded that tiered pricing with sponsor-subsidized options could increase access for those with fewer economic resources and “bridge the digital divide between users who can easily afford the cost of mobile data and those who cannot.”
*Disclaimer: This is an overview of arguments for and against net neutrality, and is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all considerations. This is also not intended to comment on the validity or legitimacy of the various arguments for or against net neutrality.

20022,2017-11-23,US judge blocks Trump policy on transgender people in military,"On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled to block U.S. President Donald Trump’s presidential memorandum banning transgender people from entering the military. In a 53-page preliminary injunction ruling, Judge Marvin J. Garbis of the Federal District Court of Maryland said the ban would likely violate equal protection provisions in the U.S. Constitution.
The American Civil Liberties Union had filed the lawsuit for six armed service members. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit included a Navy computer analyst, an Air Force suicide prevention officer and an Army cavalry scout. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice called for the case to be dismissed on grounds that no such ban had taken effect, and because the ban’s implementation was still under consideration by the Department of Defense. Garbis rejected the request, saying transgender troops were already experiencing lost promotions and canceled medical procedures.
On Oct. 30, a U.S. District judge for the District of Columbia issued a preliminary injunction against the part of the same memo that banned military enlistment by transgender people. The Trump administration appealed the decision. The Oct. 30 injunction did not overturn the part of the memo specifying that gender-reassignment surgery was not be paid for with military funds, while Garbis’ injunction does.

20023,2017-11-23,Facebook to create portal to help users identify Russian ads,"Facebook said Wednesday it would create a “portal” by year’s end to help its users determine which ads they may have seen from the Russian company Internal Research Agency (IRA). Facebook testified before congressional committees earlier this month about Russian ads on its site as part of an investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The company estimated that 150 million users had seen content from IRA over the course of two years and that, over that time, IRA had placed about 80,000 ads and posts using fake accounts. Some of the ads related to issues such as race, guns, immigration and religion, and some to candidates in the election. 
Facebook said its new portal would show users which IRA “Facebook Pages or Instagram accounts they may have liked or followed between January 2015 and August 2017.” The portal would not show what content was seen by users in their news feeds, if users did not like the content or follow the user who posted it.
On Nov. 1 and 2, Facebook, Twitter and Google representatives testified before the U.S. Senate and House intelligence committees regarding Russian ads on their platforms related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Twitter said it had removed 2,752 accounts with ties to IRA. Google said it had identified 1,000 videos from Russia-linked accounts on its YouTube service.

20020,2017-11-23,Hariri suspends resignation as Lebanese prime minister,"On Wednesday, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said he would put his resignation on hold at the request of the president, Michel Aoun. In a televised address from Lebanon’s presidential palace in Beirut, Hariri said, “Today, I presented my resignation to the president and he urged me to hold onto it for more dialogue about its reasons and its political underpinnings ... and I accepted.”
On Nov. 4, Hariri announced his resignation while in Saudi Arabia, where he holds dual-citizenship with Lebanon. He said in his resignation speech, “I sensed what is being woven in secret to target my life.” Hariri’s father was assassinated in 2005, and the U.N. is currently trying Hezbollah operatives for the murder. In his Nov. 4 announcement, Hariri also mentioned alleged Iranian influence in Lebanon that he said had created “a state within a state.” Iran supports Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Aoun had said he would not accept Hariri’s resignation unless it was submitted from Lebanon. Hariri announced on Nov. 12 that he would return to Lebanon. He left Saudi Arabia and visited with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday. He then visited Egypt and Cyprus before returning to Lebanon on Tuesday, in time for celebrations of Lebanon’s 74th year of independence.

20018,2017-11-23,Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic given life sentence for genocide,"General Ratko Mladic, a former Bosnian Serb commander, was sentenced to life imprisonment at The Hague on Wednesday for genocide and other crimes. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found Mladic, 74, guilty of 10 charges for his role in the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995. Dragan Ivetic, Mladic’s lawyer, said Mladic would appeal.
During the war in what was then Yugoslavia, Mladic was in charge of military operations against non-Serbs, such as Muslims and Croatians, as part of an effort designed to create a Bosnian Serb state. One hundred thousand people were killed during the conflict and 2.2 million were displaced.
According to the tribunal, Mladic led his Bosnian Serb army into Srebenica in July 1995, where it killed about 8,000 Muslim men and boys. Mladic also participated in the three-year siege of Sarajevo, where his troops fired artillery into the city and about 10,000 people, more than half of them civilians, died.
After the war, Mladic was not located and arrested until 2011. A tribunal judge entered not guilty pleas on his behalf, as Mladic did not enter them himself. His trial began at The Hague, Netherlands, in 2012, and included almost 10,000 exhibits of evidence and testimony from more than 500 witnesses. 
The same tribunal last year sentenced Radovan Karadzic, a Bosnian Serb politician, to 40 years in prison for war-related charges.

20090,2017-11-25,Myanmar and Bangladesh sign agreement for Rohingya return,"Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a memorandum on Thursday, agreeing to the return of Rohingya Muslims from Bangladesh to Myanmar beginning “within two months.” Approximately 620,000 Rohingya have migrated from Myanmar to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, allegedly fleeing violence from Myanmar soldiers. Some Rohingya have accused the soldiers of burning houses, stealing possessions and opening fire on civilians. Myanmar’s military denies the allegations. 
In September, Myanmar’s military carried out “clearance operations” and fights with “extremist Bengalis,” referring to Rohingya, whom it considers Bengali. These “clearance operation” conflicts allegedly began on Aug. 25 after the opposition Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army group (ARSA) killed 12 people at a Myanmar police post. Myanmar’s leader, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, said in September there have been “no conflicts since 5 September and no clearance operations.”
The Rohingya are not recognized as an ethnic minority in Myanmar and do not hold citizenship there. The conditions for the Rohingyas’ return under Thursday’s agreement have not been released.

20096,2017-11-25,Russian bobsledder stripped of 2014 Olympic gold medals,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday it had stripped Russian bobsledder Aleksandr Zubkov of his two 2014 gold medals for violating anti-doping regulations, and banned him from the Olympic games for life. 
Russia’s Bobsleigh Federation said its athletes were innocent and that it would appeal the IOC ruling at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Zubkov said, “I’m innocent. I’m a clean athlete just like my other teammates.” He also holds a silver medal from the Turin 2006 games and a bronze medal from the Vancouver 2010 games. 
RT reported that with the loss of Zubkov’s gold medals, Russia “unofficially” moves from first to second place in the 2014 Olympic Games overall medal count. Originally, Russia was awarded 33 medals, 13 of them gold, with Norway finishing in second place with 26 medals, and Canada in third place with 25 medals. 
The IOC’s actions on Friday follow an independent commission from last year and an IOC review of Russian athletes from the 2014 games in Sochi. The review concluded that Russian officials used a “systematic scheme” to hide the positive dope-test results of about 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015. Russia denies any cheating program existed and, after the commission’s findings, President Vladimir Putin set up a new anti-doping body.
Olympic officials will meet next week to consider possible penalties to Russian athletes for the upcoming 2018 Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February.

20094,2017-11-25,Refugees relocated to town in Papua New Guinea,"Papua New Guinea Police Chief Superintendent Dominic Kakas said 378 refugee men had been relocated by bus to residences in the town of Lorengau on Friday. The men,  asylum seekers who were traveling by boat to Australia, had previously been housed in a closed immigration camp. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees received reports saying force was used to relocate the men. The police say no one was forced or handcuffed.
The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court had ruled last year that the immigration camp where the men were housed was unconstitutional, and the facility was officially closed on Oct. 31. The refugees in the camp did not want to move because they were concerned about being attacked by locals.
Australia has a policy to not accept refugees who arrive by boat. According to the Australian government, this discourages people from attempting to travel across the ocean to reach the country. Australia pays Papua New Guinea and the nation of Nauru to hold refugees attempting to reach it.

On Nov. 6, Houthis took responsibility for a missile launched at the airport in Saudi Arabia’s capital city of Riyadh. The Saudis shot down the missile before it hit, and responded by imposing a blockade on air and sea ports in Yemen, which have been under Houthi control since the Yemeni civil war began in 2015.
A ship carrying 5,500 tonnes (about 6,050 tons) of wheat flour docked in a Yemeni port along the Red Sea on Sunday, according to a spokesperson for the World Food Program. Around 25,000 tonnes (27,550 tons) of wheat is due to be offloaded on Monday as well. On Saturday, a United Nations children’s agency spokesperson said about 1.9 million doses of vaccines were flown into Yemen’s capital city of Sana’a.
UNICEF director Geert Cappelaere said that another two aid ships, carrying food, water purification tablets and medicine, had not been granted clearance to dock as of Sunday.
Since the Yemeni war began, more than 10,000 people have been killed and more than seven million are in need of aid to avoid a famine, Al Jazeera reported.

20166,2017-11-27,Pakistan gov’t calls in Punjab Rangers to assist after violence in Islamabad protests,"On Sunday, Pakistan called in the Punjab Rangers to assist civilian law enforcement agencies in dispersing ongoing protests in Islamabad. Protests in the city, which blocked a major highway, began more than two weeks ago, on Nov. 8, as religious groups call for Law Minister Zahid Hamid to be fired. On Saturday, around 8,500 police and paramilitary troops implemented a day-long clearance operation that included the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and batons. Protesters resisted, news outlet Dawn reported, and at least six people were killed and hundreds injured, including law enforcement officials.
The clearance operation was launched after failed negotiations with the protest leaders. At least 150 protesters were arrested before law enforcement officials withdrew, according to Dawn. Dawn reported that five motorcycles and a car had been set on fire, and that protesters had taken two police officials. Negotiations are underway for their return, according to unnamed officials cited by Dawn.
Two weeks ago, the Islamabad High Court declared the protest illegal, and the Supreme Court ordered the government to clear the area to restore people’s right to freedom of movement. The court said that the government should continue to try to avoid the loss of life, concluding, “it does not follow that protesters can only be removed by firing upon them.”
Public and private schools in the area are scheduled to be closed on Monday and Tuesday due to the situation.
Private television channels have been offline for at least 28 hours, and social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have been blocked. After a meeting at Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s house about the failed clearance operation, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority announced that private TV channels would be restored “immediately” if they agree to certain guidelines about coverage of the protest.

20164,2017-11-27,"Bali volcano erupts; flights grounded, residents displaced","A volcano on the Indonesian island of Bali began erupting ash and steam on Saturday and continued erupting on Sunday, covering the surrounding area with a cloud of volcanic ash. Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Management has issued evacuation advisories for a 4.7-mile (7.5 km) zone around the volcano, called Mount Agung. About 24,000 residents, from 224 locations on the island, have been evacuated. Officials have also canceled flights to and from Bali’s Ngurah Rai International Airport.
The first volcanic eruption began around 5:30 p.m. local time on Saturday, and subsequent eruptions spewed ash 1.24 miles (2 km) into the air, Bali's Regional Disaster Management Agency said. By late Saturday, the ash cloud reached 4.7 miles (7.6 km) into the sky, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology reported.
Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation raised its alert level from orange to red. Indonesian authorities said that the ash cloud could reach as high as 19,654 feet (6,142 m). Indonesian authorities raised the alert to its highest level at 6:00 a.m. local time on Monday morning, due to “the possibility and imminent risk of disaster.”
About 7,000 domestic and international passengers have experienced flight cancellations, according to the airport. “Volcanic ash has only been detected in a certain area,” according to a joint statement by the airport and other officials on Sunday. The airport functions remain “normal” and some domestic flights were in operation, according to the statement. The airport operator’s general manager said food and entertainment would be provided to passengers whose flights have been canceled.
The international airport on Pulau Lombok, an island east of Bali, was temporarily closed, said spokesman Ari Ahsan.

20162,2017-11-27,"Rep. Conyers steps down from committee leadership, citing ongoing ethics investigation","Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) announced on Sunday he would step down from his position on the House Judiciary Committee, following allegations of sexual harassment. Conyers, 88, has been the ranking Democratic member on the committee for a decade and has served 27 terms as a congressman since his first election in 1964. Conyers denies the sexual harassment allegations and said that he was stepping down due to an ongoing House Ethics Committee investigation into the matter. 
Buzzfeed first reported on the harassment allegations on Nov. 20, stating that a female former staffer for Conyers alleged she was fired for turning down sexual advances from the congressman. Conyers’ office confirmed issuing a $27,000 settlement to a former staffer and denied it was paid for sexual harassment allegations. Conyers said it was similar to a severance payment. 
Another former aide, Maria Reddick, who worked as a scheduler for Conyers, filed a lawsuit against him earlier this year, alleging he engaged in unwanted touching, including rubbing her shoulders and kissing her forehead, and repeatedly requesting she go home with him. Reddick dropped the lawsuit when the judge ruled it would not be confidential. 
“I deny these allegations, many of which were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger. I very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the House Committee on Ethics,” Conyers said in a statement.
Prior to Conyers’ announcement on Sunday, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in an interview that the representative is “entitled to due process” and the “women are entitled to due process as well.” Later on Sunday, Pelosi said, “I have asked for an ethics investigation, and as that investigation continues, Congressman Conyers has agreed to step aside as Ranking Member.”

20221,2017-11-28,Pakistani law minister resigns; protests called off,"Pakistan’s Minister for Law and Justice Zahid Hamid resigned on Monday following protests over his alleged blasphemy. Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of the Tehreek-e Labbaik Pakistan Islamist group, subsequently called off the protests in Islamabad and asked people to return to their homes. BBC reported protesters were complying with the call to leave. Hamid said he had resigned “in a bid to steer the country out of the prevailing critical situation.”
The protesters had accused Hamid of blasphemy after a reference to the prophet Mohammed was left out of a revised oath for newly elected lawmakers. CNN said protesters claimed the oath was “blasphemous” because it “weakened rules requiring politicians to properly reference the Prophet Mohammed.” Hamid said the omission was due to a “clerical error.”
After the resignation, the government agreed to free arrested protesters and to pay for a clean-up after the protests. Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper reported the protesters in return had agreed not to issue a Fatwa against Hamid. A Fatwa is a non-binding Islamic legal ruling, often issued where Islamic jurisprudence is unclear. It does not equal a death sentence.
The protests had been going on for more than two weeks. This weekend, at least six people were killed and around 200 injured.

20222,2017-11-28,US Supreme Court declines to hear appeal challenging Maryland ban on semiautomatic weapons,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Kolbe v. Hogan, an appeal filed by a group of firearms advocates, including the National Rifle Association (NRA), challenging a 2013 ban on semiautomatic weapons in Maryland. The plaintiffs had argued that the ban violates their right to keep and bear arms under the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment. Bloomberg reported the decision was without comment.
Consequently, a February 2016 ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Maryland, is upheld. The Court of Appeals said the Second Amendment did not include protection for “weapons of war,” and that there was little evidence that semiautomatic weapons were suited to self-defense.
The weapons in question include semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 and the AK-47, which have recently been used in mass shootings like the Las Vegas shooting that killed 59 people on Oct.1, and the Texas church shooting that killed 26 on Nov. 5.
The Supreme Court also declined to hear a challenge to a Florida ban on openly carrying firearms.

20223,2017-11-28,Sudanese authorities arrest militia leader Musa Hilal,"Sudanese authorities arrested militia leader Musa Hilal in the Darfur region of northern Sudan on Monday. Hilal is subject to U.N. sanctions for his alleged involvement in the Darfur conflict in the mid-2000s. He was the leader of the Arab Janjaweed militia and is currently leading the Border Brigades Forces, according to the Sudan Tribune. He is also a former adviser to current President Omar al-Bashir.
Hilal was apprehended after engaging in an armed conflict with Sudanese government forces, the Rapid Support Forces, which killed 10 government soldiers. The forces were reportedly ambushed while overseeing a handover of weapons as part of a disarmament campaign.
The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when black Sudanese rebels began attacking government installations and accusing the government of favoring Sudan’s Arab population. The Janjaweed militia was later accused by the organization Human Rights Watch of carrying out ethnic cleansing of Darfur’s black population.

20224,2017-11-28,AP: FBI did not inform US Officials about Russian hacking attempt,"The Associated Press (AP) reported Sunday that only two of 80 U.S. officials had been notified by the FBI that their private Gmail accounts were on a list of addresses the Russian cyber-espionage group Fancy Bear had attempted to hack. The FBI has known about the list since last year, according to AP. “The FBI routinely notifies individuals and organizations of potential threat information,” a statement from the agency said.
The list was provided by the cybersecurity firm Secureworks. It contains 19,000 lines of data, and AP identified more than 500 U.S.-based persons on the list. The outlet contacted more than 190 of them and interviewed nearly 80, some of whom are retired. Around a quarter of the 80 people were still in active government service at the time of the attempted hacking. AP reported that a “few” more were contacted by the FBI after the list became public last year.
According to cybersecurity company Crowdstrike, Fancy Bear is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The group has been accused of involvement in the hacking of the Democratic National Congress servers during the 2016 presidential election campaign.

20225,2017-11-28,Facebook announces use of software to detect potential suicides,"Facebook announced Monday that it was expanding the use of automated software designed to detect and help prevent suicides among its users. The company began testing the pattern recognition software in the U.S. in March and it will now be used worldwide, except in the European Union due to differences in privacy laws.
The software scans posts on Facebook for phrases that might indicate a person is planning to commit suicide, for example friends asking “Are you ok?” or “Can I help?” If the software detects something, it will alert a specialized team of Facebook employees and suggest possible resources, such as telephone help lines, to the person in question. The Facebook team will ask local authorities to intervene if it deems it appropriate. For live videos, in which the software cannot detect written phrases, users can call the helpline and ask for help for the person who posted it, if it has content that is of concern.
Facebook’s vice president for product management, Guy Rosen, said first responders had looked into more than 100 people in the last month after the software alerted the company.
Facebook has 2.1 billion users worldwide.

20263,2017-11-29,Ireland’s Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald resigns,"Irish Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald announced Tuesday she was resigning, preventing a potential snap election. Opposition parties had asked she resign over her lack of action in a case involving a police whistleblower and Fianna Fáil, the main opposition party, had said it might propose a vote of no confidence if she didn’t step down. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has accepted her resignation.
Last week, an email was found showing Fitzgerald knew about an attempt to discredit the whistleblower, Sgt. Maurice McCabe, a year earlier than she had previously acknowledged. McCabe had alleged misconduct within the Garda (Irish police) beginning in 2012. Fitzgerald said she didn’t remember the email and claimed she was not able to take legal action. Additional emails were published on Monday showing other cases in which she had been aware of the attempts to discredit McCabe.
Fitzgerald said in a statement she believed it was necessary to step down to avoid a “potentially destabilising general election at this historically critical time.”
Varadkar is currently preparing for a European Council meeting on Dec. 14 and 15, during which European lawmakers will discuss the U.K. leaving the EU. One of the items on the agenda will be the future of the border between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. EU lawmakers have said this issue, among others, must be solved before moving on to negotiate the economics of the so-called Brexit deal.

20260,2017-11-29,"Airbus, Siemens and Rolls-Royce to develop a hybrid plane","Airbus, Siemens and Rolls-Royce announced Tuesday they have formed a partnership to develop a hybrid passenger plane. The proposed plane will have three conventional jet engines and one engine powered by a two-megawatt electric motor. The partnership aims to have a prototype ready by 2020 and a commercially viable model by 2030. If the technology works, then a second electric motor could be added, the statement said.
The new hybrid plane would be based on an existing BAe 146 regional jet. The plan is to use a turbine within the plane to generate the electricity needed to power the electric motor.
The weight of batteries has, until recently, limited the development of hybrid technology in airplanes, Financial Times reported. Siemens’ vice president of eAircraft said this limitation could be resolved in a relatively short time frame, due to battery technology developing at an exponential rate in response to demand from the auto industry.
Other companies, like Washington-based Zunum Aero, are also working on developing hybrid jets.

20296,2017-11-30,"Russia announces ‘demographic policy,’ subsidies for families with children","Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets announced a new measure for Russian families on Wednesday. She said the government will spend 500 billion rubles (8.6 billion) over three years in mortgage subsidies and payments to families with children. Bloomberg says she told reporters the measures have been created “to encourage Russians to have more babies.” 
On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced at a national children’s strategy meeting that the government will adopt measures to “stabilize population numbers.” He said starting in January, the government will give a monthly allowance to low-income families for 18 months, upon the birth of their first child. A current policy to issue one-time payments of 453,000 rubles upon the birth of a second and subsequent children will be extended until the end of 2021. Regarding families that have a second or third child after January, Putin said as many as 500,000 may be eligible to have mortgages with annual interest rates above six percent subsidized by the government as part of a new program.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the country’s budget will not change with the subsidies, as the funds will come from government reserves. According to the Federal Statistics Service, Russia had the lowest number of births last year since 2011 at 12.9 births per 1,000 people. According to The Telegraph, government statistics indicate the country’s population has dropped from 148.5 million in 1995 to about 143 million this year.

20348,2017-12-01,Shell UK announces 22% gender pay difference,"Royal Dutch Shell PLC's U.K. business reported Thursday that the average hourly pay of all its male employees was 22.2 percent higher than the average hourly pay of all its female employees. The oil company said the difference was due to fewer women than men in senior leadership and top technical and trading roles. Shell said it pays equally for equivalent work. 
Shell released a YouTube video on Thursday titled, “The Shell UK Gender Pay Gap,” which said 16 percent of engineering graduates in the U.K. were female. Shell U.K. said 67 percent of its employees are male and 33 percent female. It said in 2017, 27 percent of its senior management roles were held by women, up from 12 percent in 2005. Shell is the largest company in the U.K.’s FTSE 100 stock exchange index, according to BBC.
The U.K. Office for National Statistics determined the median gender pay gap for full-time employees was 9.1 percent during the first four months of this year. The rate was approximately half as much as it was in 1997, when the office started collecting statistics.    
As of Apr. 5, 2017, the U.K. requires that companies with 250 employees or more report gender pay differences by Apr. 6, 2018. Last week, the Bank of England reported that for 2017, up to Mar. 30, its average pay difference between men and women was 21.0 percent. The bank attributed this to differences in relative percentages of roles held by men and women rather than differences in pay for a given role. The majority of companies have yet to report on pay differences.

20344,2017-12-01,Israel bombs Gaza targets after mortar attack,"Israeli airplanes bombed six targets in Gaza on Thursday after Palestinian militants fired about 12 mortars at Israeli forces, according to the Israeli army. The Israeli forces were aiding construction of an underground wall near the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Israeli army spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said there were no casualties from the Palestinian mortar attacks. Gaza’s health ministry reported that two Palestinians were injured in Israel’s attacks.
The Israeli army said it had struck four “military” targets belonging to two militant groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and two “terror infrastructure targets.” 
A month ago, Israeli forces demolished a tunnel from the Gaza Strip to Israel, killing at least 12 Palestinian militants in the process. Israel is constructing a $1.1 billion underground wall with “sensors,” due to be completed in 2019, along its 36 mile (60 km) border with Gaza. CNN reported the sensors would be capable of detecting “underground activity.” Hamas and Israel have fought three wars since 2008, including one in 2014 in which Palestinians used tunnels as a way to launch attacks on Israel, according to The Washington Post.

20342,2017-12-01,US Senate suspends vote on tax bill until Friday,"The U.S. Senate postponed voting on its tax reform bill until Friday morning at 11:00 am, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday night. On Wednesday, the Senate passed a procedural vote on the bill, which had set in motion 20 hours of debate, votes on amendments, and then a planned vote on the entire bill. 
Earlier on Thursday, a report by the U.S. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that, if passed, the bill would increase the federal deficit by around $1 trillion dollars over the next ten years. 
The committee estimated the bill would lead to an additional 0.8 percent in economic growth over the next decade, which would be equivalent to around $458 billion in revenue. That figure would decrease to $407 billion after accounting for interest on debt payments, which would lower an estimated $1.4 trillion loss in tax revenue from the bill to around $1 trillion, according to the JCT.
If the bill passes in the Senate, it would be sent to committee for reconciliation with the House bill before being sent to President Donald Trump for his signature to become law. Trump said he would sign the tax bill if it passes.

20403,2017-12-04,CVS agrees to buy health insurer Aetna for $69 billion,"U.S. pharmacy company CVS Health Corp. announced on Sunday that it had entered an agreement to purchase health insurer Aetna Inc. for roughly $69 billion. CVS would purchase Aetna for $207 a share: each share of Aetna stock will be exchanged for $145 in cash and 0.8378 shares of CVS. Aetna shareholders would own about 22 percent of the company after the merger, which the companies said was expected to close in the second half of 2018.
The companies announced a plan to expand CVS’ retail medical services, from the pharmacy’s existing MinuteClinics, to include other services like vision care, nutrition advice and audiology. CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a joint conference that this would make basic care more affordable for customers. The companies said they predicted about $750 million in cost “synergies,” or savings in operating costs after a merger, by 2020, if the merger goes according to the anticipated schedule. 
The Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department may now review the merger to insure compliance with antitrust laws, such as regulations against monopolies, Bloomberg and Reuters reported. Bertolini said the companies would work with regulators to make sure the merger is approved.

20401,2017-12-04,Fighting continues in Yemen’s capital between former allied groups,"Bombings and sporadic gunfire continued in Yemen’s capital city of Sanaa for the fifth day on Sunday, as Houthi rebels fought forces who support former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Both groups, which were previously allies, have set up checkpoints, deployed snipers on rooftops and blocked entrances leading into Sanaa, the Associated Press reported. 
Medical officials anonymously told the Associated Press that almost 75 people from both sides of the conflict have died over the past five days in the capital. 
The two groups formed an alliance in 2014 to overtake the capital and overthrow the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Hadi went to Saudi Arabia in self-imposed exile, his government moved to the southern Yemeni city of Aden, and the Houthis set up a non-internationally recognized government in Sanaa. Three years prior to that, Hadi had ousted Saleh from the presidency during the country’s Arab Spring uprising in 2011, also referred to as the Yemeni Revolution or Yemen Uprising. 
The Houthis and Saleh’s forces had been fighting the Saudi Arabian-led coalition that supports Hadi’s government since 2014, until the the groups started fighting each other five days ago. The groups began fighting each other when Saleh accused Houthis of attacking Saleh’s mosque and his nephew Tarek Saleh, a commander of the special forces, AP reported. 
The Houthis reportedly control the northern area of Sanaa and Saleh’s fighters control the southern part of the city, according to AP. Houthis have reportedly taken over the Yemen Today TV station, which is associated with Saleh, and are holding 40 journalists and crew members captive, according to Yemen’s Press Syndicate.
Over the weekend, multiple sides of the conflict issued statements about changing alliances. Former president Saleh said in a televised statement on Saturday that he and his party were willing to open dialogue with the Saudi-led coalition and turn a “new page.” Afterwards, President Hadi said from Saudi Arabia that his side would support “any party confronting Houthi terrorist gangs.” 
Saleh later said, “the era of the militias is over and there is no coexistence after today between a state and a quasi-state,” according to Kuwait’s al-Rai daily news outlet. 
Houthi politician Deif Allah al-Shami said, “Saleh is over… He is now part of the coalition and the aggression.”

20386,2017-12-04,"Trump tweets about Flynn guilty plea, FBI investigations","Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted about former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump also tweeted about his firing of former FBI director James Comey.
On Friday, retired Lt. Gen. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador in Washington at the time. He also agreed to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation, Flynn said on Friday. Flynn falsely denied that he had asked Kislyak not to “escalate the situation” in response to sanctions that then-President Barack Obama imposed on Russia in December for Russia’s alleged interference in the election, according to court documents. Flynn also falsely stated to the FBI that the ambassador had not told him how Russia planned to vote on an upcoming United Nations resolution, the court document said. 
A tweet from Trump’s account on Saturday read, “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!” 
Flynn resigned from Trump’s administration in February for what he said in his resignation letter was “inadvertently” briefing Vice President Mike Pence and others with “incomplete information” regarding his “phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.”
The ranking Democratic member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), and other politicians said that Trump should have addressed the situation sooner if he knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI at the time of Flynn’s resignation, as the Saturday tweet could indicate. Then on Sunday, Trump’s personal lawyer John Dowd said he was responsible for drafting the tweet and had given it to Trump’s social media director. Dowd called it “sloppy.”
In June, Comey testified that on Feb. 14, the day after Flynn resigned, Trump told the then-FBI director, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” The president fired Comey as the FBI head in May. Trump denies he told Comey to stop investigating Flynn or fired Comey because of the investigation. “I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn,” Trump repeated in a tweet on Sunday morning, calling the story “Fake News.”
Trump also tweeted on Sunday that the FBI’s “reputation is in Tatters - worst in History,” adding “we will bring it back to greatness.”

20437,2017-12-05,Rahul Gandhi submits candidacy papers for leadership of India’s Congress party,"On Monday, Rahul Gandhi submitted papers officially nominating himself as candidate for the presidency of the Indian National Congress, also known as the Congress party. No other candidates had submitted a candidacy by Monday’s deadline. According to a party spokesperson, this means Gandhi will “likely” be declared the new Congress party president on Dec. 11 without a formal vote.
If confirmed, Gandhi, 47, will succeed his mother Sonia Gandhi and become the sixth member of his family to lead the party since India’s independence in 1947. Rahul was educated at Cambridge University, and worked as a management consultant before he became a member of parliament for Uttar Pradesh state in 2004. He was appointed vice president of the Congress party in 2013. He is the grandson of the late Indira Gandhi, who was not related by blood to the late Mahatma Gandhi.
Having previously governed India several times, the Congress party is now an opposition party in parliament, having lost the 2014 election to current Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. The next parliamentary election is scheduled for 2019.

20435,2017-12-05,Trump announces 2 Utah monuments to be reduced in size,"In a speech in Salt Lake City on Monday, President Trump announced that two national monuments in Utah would be reduced in size. The Bears Ears National Monument is to be reduced from 1.3 million acres to 228,784 acres, and the 1.9 million acres Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument will be reduced by about 45 percent. 
 
 Supporters of the decision say it will allow residents more control over how local lands are used. Opponents, including local Native American tribes and conservation groups, have said the decision will damage national heritage and 100,000 sites of archaeological importance in the area. On Monday, opposition groups announced they would sue the Trump administration to reverse the plan.
In April, Trump had asked Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke to review 27 national monuments designated by previous presidents, and to decide if they should be resized or rescinded. Zinke’s report, published in September, recommended that six of the monuments be reduced in size. The report also recommended the designation of three new monuments in Kentucky, Mississippi and Montana.
Where national parks can only be designated by an act of Congress, national monuments can be created unilaterally by a president under the Antiquities Act. The act was adopted in 1906 and is designed to protect historical objects, artifacts and sacred sites. 
 
 Each national monument has specific restrictions on land use within its area. For example, federal legislation bans mining and drilling at Bears Ears, while allowing cattle grazing. Previous presidents have also made changes — including reductions in size — to national monuments designated by their predecessors. None of those changes have been contested in court.

20433,2017-12-05,Spain’s Supreme Court denies bail for 4 Catalonian lawmakers,"Spain’s Supreme Court ruled on Monday that four former Catalan lawmakers would not be released on bail. The lawmakers were arrested on Nov. 2 and charged with sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of public funds for their roles in the October independence referendum. Former Vice President Oriol Junqueras, former Interior Minister Joaquim Forn, and the leaders of the Catalonia National Assembly and Omnium Cultural, Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixar, petitioned the Supreme Court to be released last week.
In its statement, the court said, “the judge does not believe there is a risk of flight, but understands the risk of a repeated offense.” Six other members of the former Catalonia government also jailed in early November were released Monday on 100,000 euro ($118,570) bail.
The ruling will leave the four lawmakers imprisoned during the campaign for regional elections on Dec. 21. Official campaigning starts Tuesday. Reuters reported that the latest polls show pro-independence parties are set to gain 67 of the 135 seats in the regional parliament. In the now dissolved parliament, independence parties held 72 of the seats.

20431,2017-12-05,US Supreme Court allows revised Trump travel ban to take full effect while legal challenges continue,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban can be fully enforced while legal challenges to the ban continue to be processed by lower courts. The ruling was without comment. Two of the nine justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented and voted to keep a partial stay of the travel ban in place. 
The revised travel ban is the third version of the legislation. It bans nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and some government officials from Venezuela from entering the U.S. Federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland have issued partial injunctions against the revised travel ban. Monday’s Supreme Court decision will not affect the lower courts’ deliberation on those cases.

20429,2017-12-05,Yemen’s former President Saleh killed in Houthi attack,"Yemen’s former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed in a roadside attack outside the capital Sanaa on Monday. Saleh’s General People’s Congress party confirmed he had been killed. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said in a televised speech that Saleh had been killed for “treason.”
Saleh’s supporters and the Houthis were allied until Wednesday of last week when they started fighting each other, allegedly over the control of a Sanaa mosque. More than 125 people have been killed and 238 injured since Wednesday.
Saleh was president of Yemen from 1990 until 2011. The Houthis began to fight against his government in 2004, claiming protection for Shiite Muslims from alleged government attack. The government in turn claimed Houthis attempted to overthrow it and install religious rule. The Houthis later became part of the coalition that ousted Saleh in 2011. 
In 2014, Houthis and Saleh’s supporters formed an alliance fighting against President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who had previously served as Saleh’s vice president. According to BBC, the alliance came together to campaign against unemployment, food insecurity and alleged corruption in Hadi’s government. Hadi left Yemen in 2015 and a Saudi-led coalition has campaigned to reinstate him since then. The conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis has killed 8,670 people and injured 49,960 since 2015, BBC also reported.
On Saturday, Saleh had said he was willing to “turn a new page” with the Saudi-led coalition if it stopped attacking Yemen and ended a food and fuel blockade of the country.

20476,2017-12-06,US to move embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,"President Donald Trump told Middle East leaders on the phone on Tuesday that he plans to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The White House also said Trump is expected to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday.
Trump informed Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, of the plan to move the embassy, Palestinian officials said. Jordan said he gave similar information to King Abdullah II.
U.S. officials said the move would not happen immediately for logistical reasons. As a result, Trump may sign a waiver delaying the potential move for six months, The New York Times reported. Trump previously signed a waiver in June keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv for another six months. During his election campaign last year, Trump said that he would move the embassy.
Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, and the Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. These competing claims to East Jerusalem are one of the disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Since the 1979 Camp David Accords, U.S. presidents have chosen not to move the embassy or recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, NBC News reported.
Update: During a speech from the White House on Wednesday, Trump said, “I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.” He also asked the State Department to “begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.” Trump said the decision was “not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”

20472,2017-12-06,US House Representative John Conyers retires,"U.S. Representative John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) announced his retirement on Tuesday and endorsed his oldest son, John Conyers III, to take his seat in Congress. Conyers made the announcement on a Michigan radio show and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee also announced his resignation on the House of Representatives floor Tuesday morning.
On Nov. 26, Conyers announced he was stepping down from his position on the House Judiciary Committee, following allegations of sexual harassment. Conyers denied the allegations and said he was stepping down due to an ongoing House Ethics Committee investigation into the matter. Conyers said he could not in “good conscience allow these charges to undermine” his colleagues. On Tuesday, Conyers said, “Whatever [the allegations] are, they are not accurate, they are not true” and “I think that they are something that I can’t explain where they came from.”
Conyers, 88, served 27 terms as a congressman since his first election in 1964, making him the longest serving member of the House of Representatives.
Conyers’ great-nephew Ian Conyers has also announced a bid for the now vacant Michigan House seat.

20470,2017-12-06,"More than 27,000 evacuated in California wildfire","More than 27,000 people were evacuated from their homes due to a wildfire in California’s Ventura County on Tuesday. BBC reported the fire was believed to have started near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula after 6 p.m. local time on Monday. County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said the fire grew to more than 70 square miles (44,800 acres) hours after it began.
AP reported the Ventura fire was accompanied by winds of up to 60 mph. Officials said at least 150 structures were burned in the fire and more than 260,000 lost power in the area.

20468,2017-12-06,Spanish court withdraws arrest warrant for former Catalan President Puigdemont,"On Tuesday, Spain’s Supreme Court withdrew a European arrest warrant for former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and four other former Catalan lawmakers. The warrant was issued after the five left Spain for Brussels over a month ago following Catalonia’s independence referendum on Oct. 1. Spanish authorities have charged the lawmakers with sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds for their role in the referendum, which was considered unconstitutional by the Spanish government.
Media outlets reported the withdrawal of the warrant does not mean the charges have been lifted – the lawmakers could still be arrested if they return to Spain. 
Rebellion is the most serious of the offenses for which the five have been charged, carrying a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in jail, according to Spanish news outlet El País. The Supreme Court said there was no offense equivalent to rebellion under Belgian law, which means Spain would have been obliged to try them on lesser charges if Belgian authorities were to have extradited the lawmakers to Spain on a lesser offense under the now withdrawn warrant.
Financial Times reported that Puigdemont said he would return to Spain after Catalonia’s regional election scheduled for Dec. 21.

20464,2017-12-06,Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri withdraws resignation,"Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri withdrew his resignation on Tuesday, a month after saying he was leaving office. In his statement revoking his resignation, Hariri said all members of the Lebanese government agreed to keep out of regional conflicts and the internal affairs of other Arab countries. In his original resignation speech, he alleged Iran was influencing the Lebanese government. Iran supports Hezbollah, a political and militant group in Lebanon.
“The Lebanese government, through all its political components, disassociates itself from any conflicts or wars, as well as the internal affairs of Arab countries to protect Lebanon’s political and economic relations with its Arab brothers,” Hariri’s statement on Tuesday said.
Hariri previously resigned during a televised speech from Saudi Arabia, saying, “I sensed what is being woven in secret to target my life.” This remark was in addition to his allegations of Iranian influence, which Iran said were “unfounded.” Hariri suspended his resignation at the request of Lebanon’s president after Hariri returned to the country on Nov. 21.

20514,2017-12-07,US House of Representatives votes against procedural measure on Trump impeachment,"The U.S. House of Representatives voted 364 to 58 on Wednesday against two articles constituting a procedural measure that would have led to a vote on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. U.S. Representative Al Green (D-Tex.) had filed the two impeachment articles in October. 
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) issued a joint statement after Green introduced the articles to the House on Wednesday. The statement referenced Congressional committees’ investigations on alleged coordination between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election, saying the investigations “should be allowed to continue. Now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.” Green’s articles did not reference the investigations.   
The articles were titled “Article I - Associating the Presidency with White Nationalism, Neo-Nazism and Hatred” and “Article II – Inciting Hatred and Hostility.” On Wednesday, Green said Trump has allegedly “undermined the integrity of his office and has sown discord among the people of the United States.” In a letter to lawmakers ahead of the vote, Green said, “What are we going to do about it? The answer is: impeachment for his high misdemeanors, which need not be a crime.""
In the articles, Green outlined incidents in which Trump made statements or took action relating to groups of people, including African-Americans, Muslims, Puerto Ricans, transgender individuals, football players and members of the Klu Klux Klan.

The concealed-carry act would require all states to recognize concealed-carry gun permits. The Fix NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) Act would require states to provide the federal government with FBI gun background check records, such as criminal and mental health records, as well as other information. The acts will go to the Senate for a vote.
Rep.

Under the concealed-carry act, permits would allow individuals to carry concealed weapons into other states and into federally-administered lands such as national parks. It would also allow concealed guns in school zones. Currently, concealed weapons laws differ across states.

USA Today said that, according to The New York Post, 27.5 million background checks were conducted by NICS in 2016. 
The article stated that FBI analysts have three business days to complete background checks. If a gun sale is not denied within that time, the gun can be sold. After a gun is sold, the FBI can request it be seized if it determines the individual does not meet background check requirements. Buyers may be banned from owning guns if they have a criminal record and/or mental health problems, for instance. If the FBI issues retrieval orders, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are required to collect the guns. 
USA Today reported that the ATF did not disclose the number of retrievals executed or total guns retrieved in 2016. A separate inspector general’s report said 125 retrieval orders were reviewed between 2008 and 2014. Of those, about 93 percent of guns purchased were later retrieved.

20595,2017-12-08,Franken says he will resign from US Senate in ‘coming weeks’,"On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) announced he would be resigning from the U.S. Senate in the “coming weeks,” following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. He said he was resigning for the people of Minnesota, and that it had become clear that he could not “remain an effective senator for them.” 
If Franken does resign, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, would have the option of appointing someone to fill Franken’s seat until a special election could be held during the next general election in 2018.
Franken said in his 12-minute resignation speech that “some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently.” Franken did not apologize during the speech. “I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a senator — nothing — has brought dishonor on this institution,” he said.
On Wednesday, Politico reported that an unnamed former congressional aide said Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006 in a radio studio after a taping of his radio show. On Nov. 16 of this year, broadcaster Leeann Tweeden alleged in a statement that Franken kissed her without her consent in December 2006, when he was a radio host and she was a model. She also released a picture in which Franken appears to be touching her breasts through her clothes and bulletproof vest while she was sleeping. 
The same day, Franken issued an apology for the picture and some “offensive” jokes he had made, and asked that an “ethics investigation” be undertaken. He said he did not remember the skit rehearsal as Tweeden did. 
Since the apology, seven women, two who chose to be identified and five who remained anonymous, alleged that Franken groped them or attempted to forcibly kiss them. This number includes the allegation reported Wednesday by Politico.
By the end of the day on Wednesday, more than 20 Democratic senators had called for Franken’s resignation. 
Franken is the second Democrat this week to announce he's leaving office. Rep. John Conyers, Jr., (D-Mich.) retired yesterday after he was accused of sexual misconduct.

20593,2017-12-08,Former officer Michael Slager sentenced to 20 years in fatal shooting of Walter Scott,"On Thursday, a federal judge sentenced former South Carolina police officer Michael Slager to 20 years in prison for shooting and killing Walter Scott. Slager is white and Scott was African American and was unarmed at the time of the shooting. U.S. District Judge David Norton ruled that Slager was guilty of second degree murder and obstruction of justice for false testimony. 
In April 2015, Slager, now 36, stopped Scott, 50 at the time, for a broken tail light on Scott’s car. Slager said that Scott grabbed the officer’s taser. Cellphone video taken by a passerby shows the two partway through their interaction, and does not capture this. The video shows the men as Scott starts running away from Slager. The officer fired eight shots as Scott ran away, five of which hit Scott. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police force after the shooting.
A state murder case against Slager ended in a mistrial in 2016. Slager’s attorney said during that trial that Slager had shot Scott out of fear for his life. Slager agreed in May of this year to plead guilty in federal court to violating Scott’s civil rights, in exchange for state charges against him to be dropped.

20591,2017-12-08,"California wildfires burn at least 116,000 acres; 1 woman found dead","Wildfires continued in and around Ventura County, California, on Thursday, burning at least 116,000 acres (181 square miles) and destroying at least 300 buildings. The body of a woman was found in a burned area near the city of Ojai. About 50,000 residents have evacuated affected areas, said Ventura County Fire Capt. Steve Kaufmann. California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. 
There are at least four fires currently burning: the Thomas fire, Rye fire, Creek fire, and Skirball fire. Some roads were closed due to fires, including the 101 freeway, and for a time the 405 freeway. 
Around 1,100 emergency personnel are participating in the operation to control the fires, and at least one firefighter has been injured. 
State fire officials said approximately 12,000 homes are at risk from the fires. Hundreds of schools were closed on Thursday.
The Ventura fire started near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula on Monday evening, and spread to more than 15 square miles within a few hours, according to Ventura County Fire Sgt. Eric Buschow. Fires were also burning in San Diego County.
The warm, dry Santa Ana winds helped spread the fires quickly, according to the Los Angeles Times. The National Weather Service forecast the winds to increase in speed on Thursday, before lessening Friday and Saturday. Chief Ken Pimlott of Cal Fire said gusts could be up to 80 miles per hour (129 km/h).

20589,2017-12-08,US Congress passes short-term spending bill to fund government until Dec. 22,"The U.S. House and Senate passed a spending bill on Thursday that would extend government funding until Dec. 22, 2017. The bill passed in the House 235-193, and in the Senate 81-14. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would sign the bill, which will avoid a partial government shutdown that was scheduled to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday if a spending bill was not passed. 
House and Senate leaders from both parties met with the president at the White House on Thursday to discuss next year’s budget. In the Senate, a budget bill must pass by 60 votes. Republicans hold 52 of the 100 seats, so passing the budget will require some Democratic votes. 
Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said that some of the Democrats’ priorities for next year’s budget were healthcare, immigration issues including an agreement on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), funding for veterans and programs to prevent opioid abuse. 
Spokesmen for House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said Republican budget priorities included border security, immigration enforcement and defense spending. House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said there would be “zero support” for a spending budget that is “too high.”
On Wednesday, Trump had said a government shutdown “could happen” due to immigration issues. Pelosi said, “Democrats are not willing to shut government down.”

20587,2017-12-08,Former Argentine President Fernández accused of treason,"On Thursday, an Argentine judge issued a warrant for the arrest of former Argentine president and current senator Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, accusing her of treason. Judge Claudio Bonadio’s ruling accuses Fernández of covering up Iran’s alleged role in a 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 and injured over two hundred. Fernández denies the allegations. As a current senator, she has immunity from criminal charges. Bonadio called for the Senate to waive her immunity to allow her to be arrested and tried. 
Fernández was president from 2007 to 2015, and she has been a member of the Senate since Nov. 29 of this year. She is accused of attempting to negotiate a trade deal with Iran in exchange for hiding Iranian officials’ participation in the attack on the AMIA Jewish center. 
The accusation is based on an investigation led by prosecutor Alberto Nisman in 2015, which included the use of phone taps. Nisman died of a gunshot wound in January 2015. At the time of his death, he had reported his findings in court and he was scheduled to report to congress on his investigation. The death was ruled a suicide; one official said the evidence is consistent with murder.
The Senate is currently on recess until March, but could be called back for certain matters. A two-thirds vote would be needed to rescind Fernández’s immunity from prosecution. On Oct. 25, congress voted to remove immunity for Julio De Vido, Fernández de Kirchner’s former planning minister, and he was arrested that day on charges of fraud and corruption. He denies the charges.
A charge of treason holds a sentence of 10 to 25 years in prison, Reuters reported. In separate cases, Fernández de Kirchner is being investigated for corruption, which she denies. 
Also on Thursday, police arrested at least four people for their roles in the alleged cover-up of the 1994 bombing. These people included Carlos Zannini, Fernández’s former legal secretary; Luis D’Elia, whom The Guardian described as a “social activist;” and Jorge Alejandro Khalil, a Muslim cleric. Hector Timerman, a former foreign minister was placed under house arrest.

20491,2017-12-08,"Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israeli capital, says US embassy to be moved there","On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said in a speech at the White House that the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there from Tel Aviv. Trump said, “I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.” He also asked the State Department to “begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.” 
Trump said the decision was “not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.” 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by saying, “The president’s decision is an important step toward peace, for there is no peace that doesn’t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.”
Jordanian King Abdullah II said, “Ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said before the announcement that if Trump went through with the decision, Turkey could cut diplomatic relations with Israel.
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) ordered a general strike in the West Bank and Gaza for Thursday. Protesters gathered in some Palestinian cities on Thursday and Israeli soldiers used tear gas against some of them. The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas called on Thursday for a new intifada, or uprising against Israel.
On Tuesday, Trump informed PNA President Mahmoud Abbas of the plan to move the embassy, Palestinian officials said. Jordan said Trump provided similar information to King Abdullah II. Abbas’ Fatah party said it would file a formal complaint with the U.N. 
After eight of the 15 U.N. Security Council nations called for an emergency meeting, the Security Council scheduled a meeting on Friday to discuss the situation. The Arab League is scheduled to meet Saturday on the same matter. Vice President Mike Pence plans to visit the Middle East this month.
The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 called for the relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. It established the option of a presidential waiver of the move once every six months if the president deemed it necessary to protect “national security interests.” Previous presidents have signed such waivers to suspend the move.
On Wednesday, U.S. officials said the move would not happen immediately for logistical reasons. According to Fox News, there are currently about 1,000 personnel at the embassy in Tel Aviv, and no facility is available to act as a U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Administration officials said Tuesday that Trump will sign what is to be a second a waiver “to keep from jeopardizing” State Department funding until the relocation process begins, Fox News reported.
Trump had previously signed a waiver on June 1. A White House statement that day said, “President Trump made this decision to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend America’s national security interests.” During his election campaign last year, Trump said he would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the embassy there.
Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, and the Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. These competing claims to East Jerusalem are one of the disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. According to Bloomberg, Senior Advisor to the President Jason Kushner and Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt have been working to draft an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.

20641,2017-12-11,Protests near US Embassy in Lebanon after US recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital,"On Sunday, demonstrators gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, to protest U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
According to CNN and The New York Times, demonstrators and police engaged in confrontations. Protesters reportedly threw stones and plastic bottles, and the police responded with tear gas and water cannons. 
Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, and the Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. 
Trump said last Wednesday that the decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was “not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement.” The same day, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri wrote on Twitter that Lebanon “declares on this day the highest degree of solidarity with the Palestinian people and its right to establish an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.”
Lebanon is a Muslim-majority country and, according to The New York Times, is home to more than 500,000 Palestinian refugees.

20643,2017-12-11,Iraq holds parade to celebrate victory over Islamic State,"Iraq held a military parade on Sunday to celebrate its declaration of victory over the Islamic State group (IS). Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the commander-in-chief of Iraq’s armed forces, confirmed on Saturday the army had recaptured the last remaining IS occupied areas in the country. 
Abadi declared Dec. 10 an annual national holiday. Iraqi Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Rasheed Yar Allah said the army now controls all Iraqi lands and the Iraqi-Syrian border. Reuters and The Guardian reported that remaining IS fighters might now increase guerrilla warfare attacks, as they have in the past after losing territory. 
The presence of IS in Iraq dates back to 2014, when the group occupied Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city. Iraqi forces retook Mosul in July this year. At that time, Abadi declared victory over IS, though armed conflicts with the group reportedly continued in other areas of the country.

20645,2017-12-11,Honduras’ electoral tribunal says results are ‘consistent’ after recount,"Honduras’ electoral court said on Sunday that a partial hand recount of votes from the presidential election are “consistent” with the original results. In the Nov. 26 election, current President Juan Orlando Hernández earned the most votes, winning by 1.6 percentage points (around 52,000 votes), according to the official count. 
The electoral court recounted 4,753 of approximately 18,000 ballot boxes. In this partial recount, Hernández won 50.1 percent of the votes. Opposition Alliance candidate Salvador Nasralla won around 31.5 percent.
Election observers from the Organization of American States (OAS) said there were irregularities in the election and it could not confirm the validity of the original results. The OAS issued recommendations, including a recount of disputed ballots.
Nasralla presented a formal request to annul the election. 
The electoral tribunal has until Dec. 26, or 30 days after the election, to declare a winner.

20646,2017-12-11,BAE Systems formalizes £5B contract with Qatar to provide Typhoon jets,"The British technology and security company BAE Systems formalized a £5 billion (6.7 billion USD) contract with Qatar to provide 24 Typhoon fighter jets to its armed forces. 
The contract also included the provision of missiles and weapons manufactured in the United Kingdom, cooperation between the countries’ air forces and an agreement for Qatari pilots and ground crew to receive training in the U.K.
On its website, BAE Systems describes the Typhoon jet as a “multi-role combat aircraft” that provides “simultaneously deployable Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface capabilities.”
Gavin Williamson and Khalid bin Mohammed al-Attiyah, the defense secretaries from the U.K. and Qatar, respectively, oversaw the signing of the contract. The deal is subject to financing conditions and is expected to go into effect in 2018, according to The Guardian. The Typhoon jets are scheduled to be delivered by late 2022.

20688,2017-12-12,Explosion in NYC subway injures 4; White House holds press briefing after the attack,"On Monday morning, an explosion in a corridor connecting two subway stations in Manhattan injured four people, including the suspected bomber. The explosion took place at 7:20 a.m. local time in a tunnel beneath 42nd Street, between the Times Square and Port Authority stations. New York City Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill identified the suspect as Akayed Ullah, 27. O'Neill said the “preliminary investigation at the scene indicates this individual was wearing an improvised low-tech explosive device attached to his body” and that “he intentionally detonated that device.” U.S. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a White House press briefing after the attack. 
Ullah sustained burns to his stomach and hands. He has been taken into custody and is currently hospitalized. Three bystanders near the explosion sustained headaches and ringing in the ears. The New York City Fire Department reported the three went to the hospital.
According to media reports, Ullah is a Bangladeshi national. The Associated Press reported that he was inspired by the Islamic State (IS) group, and that he had apparently no direct contact with the group and had “probably” acted alone. According to CNN, Ullah told investigators he had carried out the attack “because of recent Israeli actions in Gaza.”
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said to reporters, “This was an attempted terrorist attack.”
During the White House briefing, Sanders referred to President Donald Trump’s policy to end so-called “chain-migration,” a term the administration has used to describe family-reunification-based immigration laws. These laws allow U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to sponsor close family members to join them in the country. According to the White House, Ullah arrived in the U.S. in 2011 on an F-43 family immigrant visa.
Sanders told reporters, “The president is certainly concerned that Congress, particularly Democrats, have failed to take action in some places where we feel we could have prevented this.” She added, “Specifically, the president’s policy has called for an end to chain migration, and if that had been in place that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States. So the president is aggressively going to continue to push forth responsible immigration reform, and ending chain migration would certainly be a part of that process.”
CNN reported that Sanders did not answer a follow-up question about whether Ullah had been “radicalized” while living in the U.S., “as have recent terrorist attackers in the US who were not natural born citizens.”

20686,2017-12-12,EU leaders decline Netanyahu request to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital,"On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the European Union’s Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. During the meeting, he called for EU leaders to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and to support a U.S. peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini said the bloc remains committed to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians with “Jerusalem as the capital of both.”
Netanyahu’s request follows a Dec. 6 announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he said the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there from Tel Aviv. The Palestinian National Authority, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Jordanian King Abdullah II and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have voiced criticisms of the decision.
European lawmakers have declined to move their embassies to Jerusalem, or to support a U.S. peace plan without knowing the details of it. Czech Foreign Minister, Lubomir Zaoralek said Monday, “I am convinced that is it impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution.” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the EU would not “write a blank cheque for an unseen peace plan,” according to The Guardian.
During his meeting with EU foreign ministers, Netanyahu said the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem would make peace in the Middle East possible, “because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace.”

20684,2017-12-12,4 women call on Congress to investigate Trump sexual misconduct allegations,"At a Monday press conference and interview, four women called on the U.S. Congress to investigate the allegations of sexual misconduct they have made against President Donald Trump. Later on Monday, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) called for Trump to resign. Gillibrand is one of four Democratic senators who have called for Trump’s resignation over the allegations.
Rachel Crooks, Jessica Leeds and Samantha Holvey gave an interview to NBC News’ Megyn Kelly, and the fourth woman, Lisa Boyne, joined them later at a press conference in New York City. During the press conference, Crooks said, “I ask Congress to put aside their party affiliations and ask that they investigate Trump’s history of sexual misconduct,” adding that if Congress was “willing to investigate Senator Franken, I think it's only fair that they do the same for Trump."" Crooks also said, “In terms of resigning, it’s probably the right thing to do. But I can’t imagine he will. I think the congressional investigation is the only thing we can ask for.”
Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had previously called on Trump to resign after the allegations. In Monday’s interview, Gillibrand said that “President Trump should resign” and that “These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I’ve heard these women’s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.”
Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 16 women, with allegations spanning a period from 1993 until 2017. He has denied all allegations. On Monday, the White House released a statement saying, “These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year’s campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory.”

20682,2017-12-12,Putin announces partial withdrawal of Russian soldiers in Syria,"Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Monday that Russia would partially withdraw its troops from Syria. Putin made the announcement at Hmeimim air base in Syria, where he, together with Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “A significant part of the Russian troop contingent located in Syria is returning home to Russia,” Putin said. It has not been reported when the withdrawal would begin.
Russia has supported Assad’s government in its fight against the Islamic State (IS) group since 2015. According to Russian news agency TASS, Putin said the two countries together “defeated the most lethal group of international terrorists.” Two Russian military bases in Syria, Hmeimim and Tartus, will continue to operate.
On Sunday, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Russian air strikes have killed 6,328 civilians, including 1,537 children, in Syria.

20680,2017-12-12,US military to begin accepting transgender applicants next year,"On Monday, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that on Jan. 1 it would begin processing applications from transgender individuals who wish to join the U.S. military next year. The announcement followed a ruling from a Federal District Court in Washington that barred the Trump administration's ban on transgender service personnel. In this ruling, also from Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote, “the Court is not persuaded that Defendants will be irreparably injured by allowing the accession of transgender individuals into the military.” Judge Kollar-Kotelly also said that the ban “most likely” violates transgender people’s constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, according to The New York Times.
In June 2016, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced an end to rules banning people with “psychosexual conditions,” including transgender people, from serving in the U.S. military. The new rules were to take effect within a year. In July this year, Trump announced on Twitter his decision not to implement the new rules and to continue the ban. 
On July 27, Trump tweeted that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption” of allowing transgender individuals to serve. On Monday, the Times reported a 2016 study by the RAND Corporation estimating that allowing transgender people to serve would increase the military’s health costs from $2.4 to $8.4 million annually. The increase would represent 0.04 to 0.13 percent of its annual budget.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press briefing Monday, “The Department of Justice is currently reviewing the legal options to ensure the president’s directive is implemented.”

20737,2017-12-13,French President Macron awards climate research grants,"On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced 18 winners of grants to conduct climate change research in France. Thirteen of the grant recipients were U.S. scientists. Grant winners will relocate to France and receive up to $1.8 million in funding over three to five years. 
One of the winners was Camille Parmesan from the University of Texas in Austin, who studies the effect of climate change on wild plants and animals. As part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), she was a co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Parmesan will now continue her research at a center for theoretical and experimental ecology in Moulis, France.
President Macron invited researchers to apply for the grants in June as part of an initiative he called, “Make Our Planet Great Again.” The initiative came after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Macron’s grant offer received 1,822 applications, with two-thirds being from the U.S.
The grant winner announcement came a day before the “One Planet Summit,” which started in Paris on Tuesday. The Summit, which is co-hosted by the U.N. and the World Bank, will be attended by more than 50 world leaders. The meeting aims to “innovate, support and accelerate our common efforts to fight climate change.”

20735,2017-12-13,Russian athletes wanting to compete as neutrals supported by country’s Olympic Committee,"On Tuesday, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it would support Russian athletes wishing to compete at the Winter Olympic Games next year. Last week, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russia from the Games because of doping offenses, but said it would invite clean athletes to compete under a neutral flag as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.”
Last week’s ban came after an investigation – run by former president of Switzerland Samuel Schmid – concluded Russia had participated in “systematic manipulation” of anti-doping rules governing the use of performance-enhancing drugs. In its Dec. 5 ruling, the IOC said Russian athletes with clean doping records would be invited to compete in the Games as neutral athletes.
ROC President Alexander Zhukov said a Russian delegation would meet with members of the IOC in Switzerland on Dec. 15 to discuss what criteria the Russian athletes must comply with before being allowed to compete in the Games.
On Monday, the ROC Athletes’ Commission released a statement saying the athletes were “fully prepared” to compete under a neutral flag. The 2018 Winter Olympic Games will take place from February 9 to 15 in PyeongChang, South Korea.

20733,2017-12-13,Russia withdraws diplomatic staff from Yemen,"Russia’s Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday it has suspended its diplomatic presence in Yemen, and all personnel have left the country. Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Ambassador to Yemen Vladimir Dedushkin and his staff will temporarily perform their duties in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Zakharova said the current security situation in Yemen’s capital Sanaa was the reason for the move.
The current conflict in Sanna began on Nov. 29 when Houthis and supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh began fighting; the two groups were allies up to that point. Saleh, who was Yemen’s president from 1990 to 2011, was killed by Houthi forces on Dec. 2.
In 2014, Houthis and Saleh’s supporters formed an alliance to take control of Sanaa and oust then internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. In 2015, Hadi left Yemen and Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in the conflict, fighting against the Houthis and attempting to restore Hadi’s government.

20731,2017-12-13,6 people sentenced to death for murder of Indian man,"A court in India’s Tamil Nadu state sentenced six people to death on Tuesday over the “honor killing” of V Sankar, a 22 year-old Indian man. Of the 11 people tried in the case, six were sentenced to death, three were found not guilty, one received a double life sentence and one was sentenced to five years in prison. The court also ordered those convicted to pay a total of 1,195,000 rupees (approximately $18,500) in different proportions to Sankar’s wife, his family and the government.
Sankar was from the Dalit caste, a group with the lowest social status in India’s caste system. This group was formerly known as the “untouchables,” until this term was banned in India’s 1949 constitution. India’s caste system divides Hindus into hierarchical groups based on their work. Historically, upper and lower class castes lived in segregated communities and didn’t share food or water. Under the caste system, it was traditional for individuals to only marry within the same caste. Today, caste-based discrimination is banned under India's constitution.
Sankar met his wife Kausalya while studying. She was from a higher caste and, according to media reports, they married against her family’s wishes. On Mar. 13, 2016, a few months after their wedding, Sankar and his wife were attacked while out walking. Sankar was killed by the attackers, who used sharp weapons, and his wife was injured. One of the attackers was Sankar’s father-in-law, who later turned himself in. He was one of the six sentenced to death on Tuesday.

20724,2017-12-13,Violence in the US: Where do we place the blame?,"In a press conference on Monday, the White House suggested a pipe bomb attack in New York City would have been prevented if the U.S. didn’t have so-called “chain migration,” something President Trump says he wants to change. The White House suggested the suspect, who came to the U.S. legally in 2011, would not have been able to enter the country if Trump’s immigration policies were in place at that time.
This isn’t the first time Trump or his predecessors have oversimplified the cause of a violent attack while omitting other contributing factors. As you’ll see below, sometimes U.S. presidents attribute attackers’ actions to some undescribed “evil” or “hate,” a nonspecific “mental illness” or legislative shortcomings, such as gun or immigration laws. Ultimately, we can’t know for sure what motivates someone to attack. At best, we can know the perpetrator’s stated motive, if provided. Beyond this, we form educated guesses based on criminal profiles and other data.
Note: The attacks listed below were chosen based on the number of deaths, the media coverage of the event, and whether the president made an official statement or announcement. In cases where the president provided no reason for the attack, we instead included the media’s implied reason.
The Trump Administration (2017 - present)
New York City pipe bomb explosion
Dec. 11, 2017: Akayed Ullah, 27, allegedly detonated a pipe bomb strapped to his body, injuring four people, including himself. According to the White House, Ullah arrived in the U.S. in 2011 on an F-43 family immigrant visa.

	Attack attributed to: “Chain migration.”
	Official response: White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “The president’s policy has called for an end to chain migration, and if that had been in place that would have prevented this individual from coming to the United States. So the president is aggressively going to continue to push forth responsible immigration reform, and ending chain migration would certainly be a part of that process.”

Texas church shooting
Nov. 5, 2017: Devin P. Kelley, 26, shot and killed 26 people and injured 20 others at a Texas church.

	Attack attributed to: Mental health problems.
	Official response: Trump said the gunman was “a very deranged individual, a lot of problems,” adding, “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a gun situation.” He said, “This is a mental health problem at the highest level.”

New York City truck attack

The Obama Administration (2009 – 2017)
Florida nightclub shooting
June 12, 2016: Omar Mateen, 29, killed 49 people at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub.

	Attack attributed to: Gun access, hate, propaganda.
	Official response: In a June 16 statement, President Obama said, “Here in Orlando, we are reminded not only of our obligations as a country to be resolute against terrorists, we are reminded not only of the need for us to implement smarter policies to prevent mass shootings, we're also reminded of what unites us as Americans, and that what unites us is far stronger than the hate and the terror of those who target us.” He added, “Whatever the motivations of the killer, whatever influences led him down the path of violence and terror, whatever propaganda he was consuming from ISIL and al Qaeda, this was an act of terrorism but it was also an act of hate.”

	Attack attributed to: Gun access, “self-radicalization” possibly inspired by the Islamic State (IS) group.
	Official response: On Dec. 3, 2015 Obama said the FBI and the DOJ were still determining whether the shooting was “terrorist” or workplace related. He also said as the investigation progresses, “it’s going to be important for all of us, including our legislatures, to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide that they want to do somebody harm, we’re making it a little harder for them to do it. Because right now it’s just too easy. And we’re going to have to, I think, search ourselves as a society to make sure that we can take basic steps that would make it harder, not impossible, but harder, for individuals to get access to weapons.” The Los Angeles Times reported that the FBI had concluded the couple were “self-radicalized,” and that officials said they were inspired by terrorist groups “but did not receive financial support from any foreign or domestic organizations.”

	Attack attributed to: Gun access and mental health problems (both implied).
	Official response: At a vigil for the families affected by the shooting, Obama said, “These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change. We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true. No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society,” adding, “In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens — from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators — in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.”

	Attack attributed to: Terrorism, foreign jealousy of U.S. “freedom and opportunity.”
	Official response: In his address, Bush said, “America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining.” The attack also facilitated military action in Afghanistan and led to legislation such as the Patriot Act, which let law enforcement use surveillance against a broader set of “terror” related crimes.

The Clinton Administration (1993 – 2001)
Columbine shooting

	Official response: President Clinton spoke at the school about a month after the shooting, saying, “These dark forces that take over people and make them murder are the extreme manifestation of fear and rage with which every human being has to do combat.” Speaking to the students, Clinton said, “You have provoked Hillary and me and the vice president and Mrs. Gore to reach out across America to launch a national grassroots campaign against violence directed against young people. You can be a part of that. You can give us a culture of values instead of a culture of violence. You can help us to keep guns out of the wrong hands. You can help us to make sure kids who are in trouble, and there will always be some, are identified early and reached and helped. You can help us do this.”

They spread hate. They leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable.” Clinton continued, “I'm sure you are now seeing the reports of some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today. Well, people like that who want to share our freedoms must know that their bitter words can have consequences, and that freedom has endured in this country for more than two centuries because it was coupled with an enormous sense of responsibility.”

20774,2017-12-14,"Jones, Trump and lawmakers comment on Alabama special election","Doug Jones won the U.S. Senate special election in Alabama on Tuesday night against Republican candidate Roy Moore. Jones, 63, is the first Democratic senator to be elected in Alabama in 25 years. His win narrows the Republicans’ majority in the Senate to 51-49. Alabama’s secretary of state is scheduled to certify the election results on Dec. 28, after which Jones is to be sworn into office when the Senate reconvenes on Jan. 3.
At a Wednesday news conference in Birmingham, Alabama, Jones said he received congratulatory calls from President Donald Trump, as well as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
Moore, 70, has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, some of which purportedly involve minors. Since November, five women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct, including pursuing sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32.
Trump had originally backed former Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange in the Republican primary this year. On Dec. 4, Trump tweeted, “we need Republican Roy Moore to win.” Politico reported that Moore’s principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said the president called Moore to endorse his campaign after the tweet. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said, “Wish we would have gotten the seat … A lot of Republicans feel differently. They’re very happy with the way it turned out.”
South Dakota Sen. John Thune said that while he was “disappointed” about losing a Republican seat, he was “relieved we’re not going to be dealing with all the mess that was headed our way,"" referring to questions Moore’s win could have presented given the allegations.
On Wednesday, Trump tweeted: “The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!”
Also on Wednesday, McConnell told reporters it was an “impressive election” with a “big turnout,” saying it was an “unusual day.” McConnell declined to comment further. 
Schumer said Jones “deserved” to win the race. He also said the GOP should delay deliberation on the tax bill “until Doug Jones gets here and can cast a vote.” House and Senate Republicans reportedly reached agreement on the tax bill Wednesday.

20772,2017-12-14,UK Parliament to have final vote on EU withdrawal bill,"On Wednesday, the U.K. House of Commons voted 309 to 305 in favor of an amendment that will grant Parliament the legal right to a final vote on the country’s European Union Withdrawal Bill. Twelve members of British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party voted in favor of the bill. The amendment will require Parliament’s approval for any exit agreement reached between the U.K. and the EU in order to take effect.
The vote comes a day before May attends a two-day summit with EU leaders. If the leaders there determine there has been “sufficient progress,” negotiations will move to a second phase that would include discussions on trade and future relations.
The U.K. voted to leave the EU on June 23, 2016, and Parliament began debating the EU Withdrawal Bill on Nov. 14 of this year. According to CBS News, an agreement between Britain and the EU must be reached by fall 2018 for Parliament to approve it. Britain’s departure from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” is scheduled for March 2019.

20768,2017-12-14,Philippine Congress extends martial law for one year in southern island,"The Philippine Congress extended martial law on the island of Mindanao until Dec. 31, 2018. The approval by the country’s Senate and the House of Representatives comes after President Rodrigo Duterte requested the extension to continue fighting armed forces on the southern island. In a letter to Congress, he said the extension is needed to “bring back public order and safety in Mindanao.” Duterte first declared 60 days of martial law on May 23 this year, after armed groups laid siege to the city of Marawi. In the Philippines, martial law increases the government’s military authority and grants warrantless arrests.
According to NPR, fighting between Islamic State-linked forces and Philippine forces over five months has killed more than 1,100 people and displaced over half a million others. According to Reuters, most of those killed were fighters, and an estimated 185 IS-linked fighters are still at large.

20844,2017-12-15,FCC votes 3-2 to repeal 2015 ‘net neutrality’ rules,"The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 on Thursday to repeal its 2015 rule that internet access be classified, for regulation purposes, like a utility. The three Republicans on the commission voted for the repeal, the two Democrats against. The Office of Management and Budget must formally approve the repeal before it takes effect. An FCC representative told CNNMoney this could take “several months.”
The FCC conference room was evacuated during the meeting for a period and police with dogs appeared to search the room. FCC commissioner Ajit Pai apologized for the interruption when he reentered the room. “We were acting on the advice of the federal protection service,” Pai said.
Last month, Pai announced the proposed changes. More than six months ago, the FCC began a review process that included taking comments from the public on proposed changes. It received “millions” of comments. New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reportedly has been investigating some of the comments that are allegedly fraudulent. He tweeted on Thursday that he would sue to stop the FCC’s ruling.
The 2015 rule that the FCC repealed involved classifying broadband service providers as “common carriers” as defined under The Communications Act of 1934, which was later amended by the Telecom Act of 1996. For more information on what “net neutrality” is and some of the arguments for and against it, see our coverage here.

20848,2017-12-15,Kentucky lawmaker kills himself after sexual misconduct allegations,"Kentucky Republican state representative Dan Johnson committed suicide on Wednesday by shooting himself in the head, according to the local sheriff. Two days prior, the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR) published a report saying a 21-year-old woman alleged that Johnson had molested her in 2013, when she was 17. Johnson denied the allegation that he had groped the woman under her clothes and stuck his tongue in her mouth on New Year’s morning, 2013.
On Wednesday, authorities located Johnson dead outside his car near a bridge in Mount Washington, Kentucky, southeast of Louisville. A handgun was found at the scene. Earlier in the day, Johnson posted a message on Facebook in which he denied the allegation and asked his family to “stay strong” for his wife. His relatives called police after seeing the post. 
Bullitt County Coroner Dave Billings said authorities used Johnson’s cell phone to track his location. The Bullitt County Sheriff’s Office ruled the death a suicide. 
Johnson was accused of molesting the girl when she stayed overnight with his daughter at an apartment near the church where he was pastor at the time. According to the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR), Louisville Metro Police began investigating the allegation in April 2013, and closed the investigation without bringing charges against Johnson. 
KyCIR obtained police documents, interviewed the accuser, and published its results on Monday. The organization said police reopened the investigation on Tuesday, the same day that Johnson held a press conference at his church and denied the allegation.

20850,2017-12-15,"US, Russia each claim other’s jets cross ‘de-confliction’ line in Syria without notice","U.S. defense officials told CNN that two U.S. F-22A stealth fighter jets had intercepted two Russian jets on the U.S. side of a “de-confliction line” in Syria on Wednesday. Russian news outlet RT reported that the Russian Defense Ministry said the Su-25 jets were escorting a “humanitarian aid convoy” near Mayadin, Syria, and were intercepted by one F-22 while in Russian-controlled airspace on the Russian side of the Euphrates River.
The Euphrates River marks a de-confliction line; the U.S. and Russia have agreed to contact each other if they are planning to cross to the other side of the line. U.S. aircraft are to remain on the east side and Russian on the west side of the river unless advance notice is given.
The U.S. military said two F-22As fired flares in front of the Russian Su-25 jets that had crossed to the east side of the Euphrates. One of the Su-25 aircraft flew near an F-22A and the F-22A performed evasive maneuvers. A Russian Su-35 jet also crossed the line, according to Air Forces Central Command spokesman Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, and was intercepted by an F-22A. Pickart said the Russian aircraft returned to airspace on the west side of the river after approximately 40 minutes and multiple calls on the emergency de-confliction channel between U.S. and Russian forces in Syria.
The Russian Defense Ministry said an F-22 crossed over to the west side of the Euphrates to engage with the Russian Su-25 jets. The ministry said an Su-35 flew towards the F-22 and then the U.S. jet flew away.
According to RT, the U.S. and Russia established the de-confliction channel in 2015 as part of a “flight safety memorandum” in Syria. Pickart said Russian jets fly into U.S. airspace in the de-confliction area 6 to 8 times per day. CNN did not report on how many of those times were after pre-notification using the de-confliction channel. 
In November, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump met in Vietnam and issued a joint statement agreeing to “maintain open military channels of communication” in the “fight against” Islamic State in Syria.

20842,2017-12-15,"Haley: Yemeni Houthi missiles fired at Saudi Arabia came from Iran, violate UN resolution","U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Thursday that missile debris found in Saudi Arabia was determined to be of Iranian origin, in violation of a U.N. resolution. The debris was from two Yemeni Houthi rebel missiles fired in November. Iran’s spokesman at the U.N. said Iran “categorically” rejects the evidence as “unfounded” and “fabricated.” 
Haley, speaking at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., said nine valves and a lack of fins on one piece of debris indicated it was from an Iranian Qiam missile. She said the U.S. was disclosing this evidence for Congress and U.N. members to see. “International peace and security depends on us working together against the Iranian regime’s hostile actions,” she said. 
Haley said the Iranian origin of the missiles was evidence that Iran violated U.N. Resolution 2231, adding that the U.S. was not currently planning to use the evidence to end the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. The 2015 agreement restricts Iran’s nuclear activities and ballistic-missile related activities in exchange for a lifting of sanctions against the country.
The missiles that Haley spoke about were fired at Saudi Arabia by Yemeni Houthi rebels, one allegedly aimed at Riyadh airport and the other intercepted near Mecca. The Iranian spokesman at the U.N., Alireza Miryousefi, said the accusations that Iran supplied the missiles “seek also to cover up for the Saudi war crimes in Yemen, with US complicity.” 
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres submitted a report to the U.N. Security Council concluding that the two missiles found in Saudi Arabia were of common origin. The report said they could not be conclusively stated to have originated in Iran.
According to Saudi state news agency SPA, Saudi Arabia “welcomes the UN report” and said the international community should “hold the Iranian regime accountable for hostile actions.”

20960,2017-12-18,Trump’s lawyer says Mueller improperly obtained emails; Mueller’s office denies accusation,"On Saturday, a lawyer representing President Donald Trump’s transition team sent a letter claiming U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller improperly obtained emails belonging to the team. Mueller’s team is investigating whether or not any members of then-presidential candidate Trump’s team cooperated with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
A spokesman for Mueller’s office denied the emails were obtained improperly. “When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner’s consent or appropriate criminal process,” the spokesman said.     
Kory Langhofer, a lawyer representing the transition team Trump for America, argues in his letter that federal General Services Administration (GSA) employees improperly shared private communications with Mueller’s team in August, without first allowing lawyers from the transition team to review them.
“The materials produced by the G.S.A. to the special counsel’s office included materials protected by the attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process privilege, and the presidential communications privilege,” Mr. Langhofer said in the letter.
Mueller's team obtained emails, laptops and cellphones from nine members of Trump’s transition team, according to the letter.
The letter was sent to two committees: the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as well as the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
The president’s lawyers and Mueller’s team are scheduled to meet his week for a conference on the status of the investigation, The Washington Post reported. 
Trump has denied there was any collusion with Russia. He said on Sunday that he is not considering firing Mueller.

20954,2017-12-18,Peru to hold vote on whether to impeach President Kuczynski,"Lawmakers in Peru are scheduled to hold a vote this Thursday to decide whether to impeach President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for “permanent moral incapacity,” in relation to an accusation that he received bribes from Brazilian oil company Odebrecht. Kuczynski has denied the allegations. 
On Wednesday, lawmakers presented documents from Odebrecht showing a payment of $782,000 to Kuczynski’s financial consulting firm, Westfield Capital, made between 2004 and 2007. 
On Thursday, Kuczynski said he had no involvement in those payments. In an open letter published in La República newspaper on Saturday, Odebrecht said the payments were for services “effectively rendered to Odebrecht’s enterprises, duly paid and officially accounted for.” The letter adds that the services were hired exclusively through Kuczynski’s partner in his firm.
On Friday, 93 of 118 lawmakers in Peru voted in favor of starting impeachment proceedings against the president. At least 87 votes are required to impeach the president. Kuczynski said in a tweet last week that he would not “give up my honor, nor my values, nor my responsibilities as president of all Peruvians.” 
In 2016, Odebrecht admitted to the U.S. Justice Department that it had paid bribes to politicians in Latin America to obtain public contracts. Kuczynski, 79, was elected president of Peru in 2016.

20939,2017-12-18,Pentagon-funded program investigated UFOs from 2009 to 2012,"Politico and The New York Times reported on Saturday that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) operated a program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 2007 to 2012. The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) was started by then-senator Harry Reid (D-NV). The DOD reportedly spent more than $20 million on the program. A spokesperson for the DOD said the program was ended in 2012, citing “other, higher priority issues that merited funding.”
Reid said he started the program with the late Senators Daniel Inouye (D-Hi) and Ted Stevens (R-Ala.). Reid, now retired, was the Democratic Senate majority leader at the time. He said Stevens told him that while a pilot during World War II, he had been followed for some miles by an aircraft with “no known origin.”
Politico reported that an anonymous former congressional staffer said the program may have in part been created to determine if China or Russia had developed technologies that could threaten the U.S.
Luis Elizondo, a military intelligence official, directed AATIP from the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Some of the money from the program reportedly went to Bigelow Aerospace, headquartered in Las Vegas. In May, the company’s founder Robert Bigelow said on “60 Minutes” that he was “absolutely convinced” that extraterrestrials exist and they have visited Earth as UFOs. He also said “China and Russia are much more open and work on [investigating UFOs] with huge organizations.”
Elizondo said that, as part of AATIP, Bigelow’s company studied metals and other materials that had reportedly been recovered from UFOs, interviewed witnesses and physically examined people who said they had experienced physiological changes from UFO encounters. 
Elizondo resigned in October, asking in his resignation letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis, “Why aren’t we spending more time and effort on this issue [of unidentified aerial phenomena]?” Elizondo is currently the Director of Global Security and Special Programs at To The Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences, a “Public Benefit Corporation” whose mission includes exploring “exotic science and technologies,” according to its website.
The Times reported that about $22 million had been appropriated for AATIP from 2008 to 2011. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said the program “ended in the 2012 timeframe.” Reid said in Nevada this year, “I think it’s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I’ve done something that no one has done before.” 
The Times reported that Pentagon officials who had been part of AATIP continue to investigate UFO sightings from the military without directly appropriated funding for the work. The CIA released over 12 million pages of declassified documents this year that included UFO sightings. One video released by AATIP is of a Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet view screen, which shows a dark flying object with a surrounding lighter area; the object travels for a time and then rotates as it travels further.
From 1947 to 1969, the Pentagon ran programs to investigate UFOs. From 1952 to 1969, the program was called Project Blue Book. Of more than 12,000 UFO sightings it investigated, 701 remained unidentified. 
The Times cited M.I.T. astrophysicist Sara Seager, who “cautioned that not knowing the origin of an object does not mean that it is from another planet or galaxy,” according to the outlet.

Under EU state aid rules, member states are prohibited from granting corporations tax benefits that are not available to all companies within the bloc.
The Commission’s press release said it had “concerns that two Dutch tax rulings may have allowed Inter IKEA to pay less tax and given them an unfair advantage over other companies, in breach of EU State aid rules.”
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said, “All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax. Member states cannot let selected companies pay less tax by allowing them to artificially shift their profits elsewhere. We will now carefully investigate the Netherlands’ tax treatment of Inter IKEA.”
Inter IKEA released a statement saying, the “Inter Ikea Group including its subsidiary Inter Ikea Systems BV is committed to paying taxes in accordance with laws and regulations wherever we operate. The way we have been taxed by national authorities, has in our view been in accordance with EU rules. It is good if the investigation can bring clarity and confirm that.” A Dutch EU official said, ""The Netherlands fully supports the Commission's work.”
The Commission will be investigating two Dutch tax rulings from 2006 and 2011, which it says have “significantly reduced Inter IKEA Systems' taxable profits in the Netherlands.” The money has allegedly been illegally shifted to Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, where IKEA pays less or no tax. 
The Commission has also investigated companies such as Amazon, Apple and McDonald’s. In October, the Commission referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice for not recovering illegal tax benefits from Apple worth up to €13 billion (more than 15 billion dollars).

20990,2017-12-19,Former President Sebastian Piñera wins Chilean presidential election,"Sebastian Piñera was elected president of Chile on Sunday, winning 54.58 percent of the votes in a runoff, according to Chile's Electoral Service. His opponent Alejandro Guillier received 45.42 percent of the votes and has conceded. The turnout was 48.5 percent. Piñera is scheduled to take office in March next year, after incumbent President Michelle Bachelet concludes her four-year term. 
In his victory speech, Piñera said, “Chile needs agreements more than confrontations,"" and referring to Guillier, he said, “I want to talk to him about the points we agree about.""
Piñera, 68, is a businessman. He previously served as Chile’s president from 2010 to 2014. His Chile Vamos party holds 72 of the 155 seats in the parliament’s lower house. BBC reported that during his campaign Piñera spoke about lowering taxes to improve Chile’s economy. BBC and Reuters describe his policies as “conservative.”

20988,2017-12-19,Hernández declared winner of Honduras presidential election,"On Sunday evening, Honduras’ electoral tribunal declared incumbent President Juan Orlando Hernández winner of the Nov. 26 presidential election. Electoral Tribunal President David Matamoros said Hernández had received 42.95 percent of the votes, and his closest opponent Salvador Nasralla had received 41.42 percent. Honduras does not have a runoff vote.
Before the official announcement Nasralla said he would not recognize the result. He also called for his supporters to protest against the announcement Monday. 
Hernández has yet to comment on the announcement from the electoral tribunal. His sister was killed in a helicopter crash on Saturday. 
Late Sunday, the Organization of American States (OAS), which sent observers to the election, called for a new vote due to irregularities. OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro said the election was “characterised by irregularities and deficiencies,” and classified it “as technically very low quality and lacking in integrity.”
The initial results, published by the electoral court the day after the November election, showed Nasralla in the lead with 60 percent of votes counted. The Financial Times reported the vote counting system allegedly crashed before the count was complete. Results published after the alleged crash showed Hernández leading the count. Protests and allegations of fraud followed. Some of the protests have turned violent, and at least 17 people have been killed since the election.
Hernández, 49, is a businessman and former member of parliament. He first took office as president in Jan. 2014, during a time when Honduras’ constitution did not allow an incumbent or former president to run for reelection. In 2015, the country’s supreme court overturned the ban, allowing candidates to seek reelection.

20986,2017-12-19,South Africa’s ANC party elects new leader Cyril Ramaphosa,"On Monday, South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party elected Cyril Ramaphosa as its new leader for a five-year term. Ramaphosa is South Africa’s deputy president and he will replace President Jacob Zuma as ANC party leader. Ramaphosa, 65, beat former Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma 2,440 to 2,261 votes at a party conference in Johannesburg. Dlamini-Zuma is the former wife of outgoing leader Jacob Zuma.
During the apartheid period, Ramaphosa was a trade union leader and formed part of the team that negotiated the transition from apartheid to democracy in 1994. He left government in 1997 for the private sector. CNN reported that since his return to politics, Ramaphosa has spoken out against corruption.
The ANC has ruled South Africa since 1994. It currently holds a majority in parliament, with 249 of the 400 seats. The party lost its majority in three cities, including Johannesburg, in last year’s municipal elections.

21057,2017-12-20,"Amtrak train derails in Washington state, killing 3","An Amtrak train that derailed in Washington state on Monday morning was traveling at 80 mph on a curve with a posted speed limit of 30 mph. Some of the train’s coaches fell off an overpass crossing Interstate 5 near Olympia, Washington, damaging five cars and two trucks on the road below. Three passengers on the train were killed, and about 70 people were injured according to The Seattle Times.
The Seattle Times reported about 80 passengers and seven crew members were on the train when it derailed. The train was making a first run on a new route that was part of a $181 million rail project between Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. 
Bella Dinh-Zarr of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Monday it’s too early to determine why the train was going 50 mph faster than the speed limit. Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson said that positive train control (PTC) equipment had been installed along the 14.5 mile line, and that it was not yet operational in the area of the derailment. PTC automatically reduces a train’s speed when it travels over a certain limit. Congress has mandated that PTC be operational on railroad lines by the end of 2018.
NTSB expected its investigation into the cause of the crash to last about a week. The U.S. Department of Transportation said Tuesday it would be sending a team of 15 experts from the Federal Rail Administration to aid in the investigation.

21055,2017-12-20,"US House, Senate pass tax reform bill","On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 227-203 to pass the latest version of the tax reform bill, called the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” The Senate passed the bill after midnight Wednesday and the parliamentarian – the official advisor responsible for interpreting Senate procedures – rejected three provisions in the legislation, saying they violated budget rules. This means the House will need to vote on the bill again in its amended form. The House is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on the amended bill.
If both the Senate and House votes pass, the bill will be sent to President Donald Trump to be signed. Trump tweeted that if the bill passes the House on Wednesday morning, there will be a White House press conference at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
History of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
The House passed a version of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” on Nov. 16. The Senate passed its version of a tax reform bill, also titled the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” on Dec. 2. The two bills were then sent to a committee to negotiate a compromise version of the bill, which was released on Friday. This was the version of the bill on which the House voted on Tuesday.
Here are some ways the compromise bill differed from the House and Senate versions of the legislation:

	

	Changed individual tax rates. Under the compromise version, the rates are:

	10% for up to $9,525 
	12% for $9,525 to $38,700
	22% for $38,700 to $82,500
	24% for $82,500 to $157,500
	32% for $157,500 to $200,000
	35% for $200,000 to $500,000
	37% for over $500,000


	Increased child tax credit to $2,000.
	Reduced corporate tax rate to 21 percent instead of 20 percent.
	Did not appeal the Johnson amendment, which prohibits nonprofits from directly donating to political campaigns.

21054,2017-12-20,Saudi Arabia shoots down Yemeni Houthi missile,"Saudi Arabia reported on Tuesday it shot down a missile launched by Yemen’s Houthi group towards a residential area of Saudi Arabia. Houthis said the missile was aimed at the Saudi al-Yamama palace, where Saudi leaders were meeting. State-run Saudi news agency, SPA, said there were no casualties. Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a spokesman for the Houthis, told Al Jazeera there were “several casualties.” Al-Bukhaiti said Houthis fired a Burkan 2-H Scud missile.
Saudi-run Center for International Communication on Twitter called the missile an “Iranian-Houthi” missile. Saudi Arabia and U.S. officials have accused Iran of supplying weapons to the Houthis. Iran, which supports the Houthis politically, has denied this claim.
The missile was launched on day 1,000 of the conflict between the government and the Houthis in Yemen. The fighting has resulted in at least 10,000 deaths and over 2 million people displaced. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict after the Houthis seized Yemen’s capital from President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
This was the third missile launched from Yemen since November that Saudi Arabia says it has shot down over its territory. The first was on Nov. 4 near Riyadh’s King Khaled Airport, and the second on Nov. 30 near Khamis Mushait.

21103,2017-12-21,US House passes final tax reform bill,"The U.S. Congress passed its tax reform bill on Wednesday, sending it to President Donald Trump for his signature. The U.S. House of Representatives voted 224-201 in favor of passing the final version of the bill. No Democrats voted in favor of the bill and 12 Republicans voted against it. 
The House passed a version on Tuesday and sent it to the Senate for approval. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that three provisions in the version did not comply with the Senate’s Byrd Rule, including the bill’s name. The title was then changed to, “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.” The Senate voted 51 to 48 in favor of changing the provisions, then sent the bill back to the House for reapproval.  
In findings released Monday, Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that middle-class Americans would receive half of the bill’s tax cuts and 14 percent of the tax cuts would go to individuals with income over $1 million a year. 
The JCT projects that in 2019, all income groups will see an 8 percent reduction in taxes and that by 2027, taxpayers earning up to $75,000 will have a tax increase. Earlier this month, the JCT published a report estimating that the Senate bill at the time would increase the federal deficit by $1 trillion within the 10 years.
The Tax Policy Center, a private nonpartisan group, produced a separate study that estimates individual taxes will decrease by an average of $1,600 in the next year. The group estimates that those earning over $773,000 would see tax reductions averaging $51,160, those earning above $149,000 would get cuts of $7,640, and those with income below $25,000 would have a reduction of about $60.

21101,2017-12-21,European Court of Justice determines Uber will be regulated as transportation service,"The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Wednesday that Uber, a ride-hailing company based in San Francisco, is a “service in the field of transport.” The ruling said that the 28 EU member states will regulate the conditions under which Uber operates. 
Uber uses a smartphone application the purpose of which is to connect “non-professional drivers using their own vehicle with persons who wish to make urban journeys.” The company had argued it was an intermediary technology company, not a provider of transportation services.
A spokesperson for Uber said the ruling “will not change things in most EU countries where we already operate under transportation law.” The company will be subject to regulations that could include added permit and licensing requirements for the company and drivers, and a possible cap on the number of vehicles Uber has on the road. Uber regulations may vary between markets, depending on how each member state regulates transportation services.

21099,2017-12-21,Congress releases data on settlements involving House offices,"The U.S. House Administration Committee released information on Tuesday about claim settlements involving the offices of members of Congress. The committee indicated a U.S. Treasury fund was used to pay $342,225 to settle 15 claims from 2008 to 2012, involving House member offices. Eight of those settlements, totalling $174,000, were for claims of sexual discrimination or harassment. 
The Office of Compliance also disclosed that between 2013 and this year, settlements totaling $359,450 have been paid. One of those involved a claim of sexual harassment.
The Treasury fund was created in 1995 under the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). It is funded with tax revenue. Since its creation, it has paid more than $17 million to settle 264 claims of CAA workplace violations, including cases related to disability and age discrimination.

21097,2017-12-21,UN to vote on resolution to rescind recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital; Trump says he’s ‘watching’ who votes against,"The U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to vote Thursday on a resolution that the U.S. withdraw its Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The resolution would prohibit any country from establishing “diplomatic missions” in Jerusalem. On Wednesday, the day before the special session vote, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be “watching” who votes against the U.S. decision. 
“They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us,” Trump said. “Well, we’re watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We’ll save a lot. We don’t care.”
On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley sent a letter sent to the U.N. in which she said Trump asked her to “report back on those countries who voted against us.” Trump said he “liked” Haley’s message and that it was “for all those nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council, or they vote against us potentially at the assembly.” 
On Monday, the U.S. vetoed the resolution in a Security Council vote, and the other 14 Security Council members voted in favor of it. That draft of the resolution asks that any actions that “have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem” be rescinded and take no legal effect. It did not mention the U.S. or Trump by name.
General Assembly resolutions, unlike Security Council ones, are not legally binding.

What are ‘pass-throughs’?
“Pass-throughs” are businesses where the income “passes through” to the owner(s) and is taxed as individual income for that owner(s) rather than as income for a business, such as is the case for C-corporations. According to the Brookings Institute, Pass-throughs include S-corporations (those that have shareholders), partnerships, and sole proprietorships. In 2014, there were 26 million registered businesses in total, and about 95 percent of them were pass-throughs.
Brookings makes the distinction that “small” businesses are those with less than $10 million in yearly receipts. In 2014, 81 percent of profits in pass-through businesses were made by businesses with more than $10 million of total receipts, which represented one percent of all firms. Pass-through businesses represent a larger fraction of business income now than they have in the past. In 2013, C-corporations, i.e., non-pass-through businesses, earned 44 percent of business income.",Context|Economy|Law &amp; Justice|Politics,USA,vote,Congress|Senate,Washington,legislation|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|tax reform|taxes,world_news,publish
21123,2017-12-22,UN General Assembly approves resolution ‘demanding’ no change to Jerusalem’s status,"A majority of the U.N. General Assembly voted on Thursday in favor of a resolution that “demanded” compliance with Security Council resolutions on Jerusalem’s status. The non-binding vote was in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and call on the U.S. State Department to prepare to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. 
Thursday’s resolution, drafted by Turkey and Yemen, “demanded” that “all States comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem, and not recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions.” It also called upon member states to “refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions” in Jerusalem, in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolution 478, adopted in 1980.
Turkey and Yemen requested the emergency session of the General Assembly after the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution on Monday. That resolution, drafted by Egypt, expressed “deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.” The other 14 nations of the Security Council voted yes to that resolution.
Of the 193 nations of the General Assembly, 128 voted for Thursday’s resolution, nine voted against, 35 abstained and 21 were not present to cast a vote. The countries that voted against the resolution were the U.S., Israel, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Togo. Some of the countries that abstained were Argentina, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.
After the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “Israel completely rejects” the resolution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the vote was a “victory for Palestine.”
Prior to the vote, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley wrote in a letter to General Assembly members, “The [U.S.] president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those who voted against us.” She also said the U.S. will remember the day of the vote when it’s “called upon” to “make the world’s largest contribution to the United Nations, and so many countries come calling on us... to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.”
“America will put our embassy in Jerusalem,” Haley said. “It is the right thing to do.”
The U.S. “will use U.N. votes as one factor in our foreign relations,” according to a statement Haley’s office released after the vote. “It’s not going to be the only factor, or even necessarily the number one factor, but it will no longer be ignored.”

21121,2017-12-22,3 pro-independence parties together win majority of new Catalan regional parliament,"Catalonia re-elected pro-independence parties in a regional election on Thursday, according to preliminary results. Eighty-one percent of the 5.3 million eligible voters turned out to elect a new parliament. Three pro-independence parties, Together for Catalonia, Republican Left of Catalonia and Popular Unity, were projected to win 48 percent of the vote, 70 seats in total, giving pro-independence parties a majority of the 135 total seats. 
Projections were based on 95 percent of the votes counted. The Citizens (Cs) party, which supports Catalonia remaining as a semi-autonomous region of Spain, was projected to win the most votes of any single party: 25 percent, and 36 seats. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s Popular Party was projected to win three seats, fewer than the 11 it won in 2015. Together for Catalonia won the second-most votes.
Carles Puigdemont, former Catalan president and member of the Together for Catalonia party was in Brussels, Belgium, during the vote, along with four of his ministers. They left Spain in October. Spain issued a warrant for his and his associates’ arrest on charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds for their role in the October referendum for Catalan independence. The warrant was later dropped. Charges could still be filed against Puigdemont if he returns to Spain. 
After the Catalan referendum in October, Puigdemont declared independence from Spain and then suspended the implementation of independence. Rajoy then dissolved Catalonia’s government and called for a new regional parliament to be elected on Dec. 21.
Some other members of Catalonia’s former government, including former-Vice President Oriol Junqueras, are imprisoned in Spain. Junqueras is a member of the Catalan Republican Left that obtained the third-most votes on Thursday.
Sixteen percent of Spain’s population lives in Catalonia.

21119,2017-12-22,CDC: US life expectancy declines for second straight year; drug overdose deaths up,"Average life expectancy in the U.S. was 78.6 years in 2016, a decline from 78.7 years in 2015. Drug overdose deaths increased by 21 percent in 2016 from 2015. The National Center for Health Statistics, part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), released the figures on Thursday in reports on life expectancy and drug overdose deaths.
For women, life expectancy remained 81.1 years, while men’s life expectancy declined from 76.3 to 76.1 years between 2015 and 2016. 
There were 2.74 million deaths in the U.S. last year. The top 10 causes of death remained the same from 2015 to 2016. Of the total deaths in 2016, 74.1 percent of them resulted from the top 10 causes of death. 
Death rates fell for seven of the 10 causes, while death rates from three increased: Alzheimer’s, suicide, and “unintentional injuries.” Alzheimer’s deaths increased by 3.1 percent, suicides by 1.5 percent, and “unintentional injuries” rose 9.7 percent in 2016. 
“Unintentional injuries,” including drug overdoses, traffic collisions and falls, are now the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer. Drug overdose deaths increased by 21 percent to 63,632. Opioid-specific overdose deaths rose 28 percent, with more than 42,000 deaths in 2016. From 1999 to 2016, the death rate from drug overdoses increased from 6.1 to 19.8 people per 100,000.
For people in the U.S. who survive until age 65, the average life expectancy is 83 for men and 85.6 for women.
“If you look at the other developed countries in the world, they’re not seeing this kind of thing. Life expectancy is going up,” said Bob Anderson, chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch at the National Center for Health Statistics. He said that for the U.S., “the key factor is the increase in drug overdose deaths.”
The World Health Organization reported average global human life expectancy at 71.4 years in 2015 and at more than 80 years in 29 “high-income” countries.

21117,2017-12-22,US Vice President Mike Pence visits Afghanistan,"U.S. Vice President Mike Pence made a previously unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Thursday, the first such trip by either the vice president or President Donald Trump. Pence flew into Bagram Air Base on a C-17 military aircraft and took a helicopter to Kabul, where he met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Afterwards, he visited U.S. troops at the Bagram base. 
While at Bagram, Pence was briefed by Gen. John Nicholson on the war in Afghanistan, which has lasted 16 years. According to USA Today, the Taliban control close to half of Afghanistan’s territory. Islamic State also has an armed presence in the country. 
The U.S. has approximately 15,000 troops in Afghanistan, having increased troops by about 3,800 since Trump spoke in August about his strategy for the country. Hundreds more U.S. Army trainers are scheduled to be sent to Afghanistan in the first half of next year, USA Today reported. The U.S. has asked its NATO allies to increase the number of troops they have in Afghanistan.
In 2010, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan reached its maximum of about 100,000, after which the Obama administration decreased that number. In comparison, the U.S. currently has about 5,200 troops in Iraq and about 2,000 in Syria, Bloomberg reported.

21235,2017-12-25,Opposition leader Navalny gathers signatures for Russian presidential nomination,"On Sunday, 742 people signed a petition in Moscow nominating opposition leader Alexei Navalny as a candidate in Russia’s March 2018 presidential election. Navalny, 41, is a lawyer who has led multiple protests against incumbent President Vladimir Putin since 2011. 
The Russian Central Election Commission received the signatures and associated documentation from Navalny. The commission’s head Ella Pamfilova said he would not be allowed to participate in the electoral race given a prior conviction, which Navalny has said is without merit.
Navalny’s supporters gathered on Sunday alongside a river in Moscow. His team said two election commission members were present to observe the endorsement event, in which Navalny spoke and referred to Putin as a “bad president.” 
People rallied in support of the opposition leader in at least 20 cities on Sunday. According to The Associated Press, Navalny required a minimum of 500 signature “endorsements” to be eligible to get on the presidential ballot, which requires gathering an additional 1 million signatures. Navalny said he would ask his supporters to boycott the election if his registration in the race were rejected.
In February, a Russian court gave Navalny a suspended sentenced for embezzlement. He has denied the charges. Under Russian electoral law, people with a criminal record cannot run for president within 10 years of serving or officially being recognized as having served a sentence. Navalny has been arrested three times this year for organizing unauthorized demonstrations against Putin.
On Dec. 6, Putin announced he would run for a fourth presidential term. The Guardian said polls put Putin’s approval rating at about 80 percent.

21233,2017-12-25,"Tembin upgraded to typhoon, heads toward Vietnam after at least 90 dead in Philippines","Tropical storm Tembin intensified to a typhoon on Sunday, after it caused flooding and mudslides in the Philippines. At least 90 people have been reported dead. Tembin, called “Vinta” in the Philippines, exhibited maximum sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (120 kph). The storm made landfall on the Philippine island of Mindanao on Friday and Balabac Island on Saturday.
Reports of the death toll varied. The CEO of the Philippine Red Cross tweeted that 156 people had been killed, 86 injured and 291 are missing. On Sunday, a spokeswoman for the Philippines’ national disaster management agency said 159 people are missing. The International Red Cross reported Saturday that 50,000 of the 70,000 people displaced by the storm are in shelters.  
Tembin is forecast to reach Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam on Monday after weakening to a tropical storm. About 4 inches (10 cm) of rain is forecast for that area over the next day or two. After Vietnam, the storm is forecast to pass along the coasts of Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.
A typhoon differs from a hurricane only in location, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Typhoons occur in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. Hurricanes occur in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific Oceans.

21231,2017-12-25,North Korea calls third UN sanctions this year ‘act of war’,"North Korea said on Sunday that the third set of U.N. sanctions passed against it were an “act of war.” On Friday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution to impose the sanctions by a unanimous vote of 15-0. The state-run Korean Central News Agency released a statement saying North Korea “categorically reject[s]” the resolution, and that the countries that voted for sanctions “shall be held completely responsible for all the consequences to be caused by the resolution.”
North Korea conducted an intercontinental ballistic missile test on Nov. 28. The U.S.-drafted resolution 2397 was a response to the country’s missile and nuclear tests. Among other provisions, it cuts refined petroleum exports to the North by 89 percent and calls for about 100,000 North Korean workers in other countries to return within two years. 
Previous resolutions this year imposing sanctions on North Korea included resolution 2375 on Sept. 11 and resolution 2371 on Aug. 5.

21300,2017-12-27,Haley announces $285 million reduction to 2018-19 UN general operating budget,"On Sunday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said the organization had agreed on a two-year, $5.4 billion operating budget for 2018-2019. The budget was reduced by $285 million, or about 5 percent from the final 2016-2017 budget. The U.N. operating budget is separate from a peacekeeping budget that was reduced in June by $600 million to $6.8 billion for 2017-2018. 
Agence France-Presse reported two weeks ago that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had proposed a $200 million reduction from the 2016-2017 operating budget, and the U.S. proposed an additional $250 million decrease. Haley’s office, the United States Mission, said the negotiated total decrease of $285 million was the result of reductions in travel expenses, consultant fees and the leasing of space outside the U.N. building in New York.
The 193 member countries of the U.N. are required to contribute to its budget amounts determined by a formula that factors each country’s population and gross national income. For 2016-2017, the U.S. paid about $1.2 billion, or 22 percent of the U.N.’s $5.4 billion annual operating budget. The U.S. contributed approximately $2 billion, or about 28 percent of the peacekeeping budget this year.
Haley’s office released a statement saying the reduction in spending combined with “moves towards a more efficient and accountable U.N.” was a “big step in the right direction.” The statement added, “we’ll continue to look at ways to increase the U.N.’s efficiency while protecting our interests.”
On Dec. 6, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and prepare to move the U.S. embassy there. Last week, the U.N. General Assembly voted 128-9 to “demand” that Jerusalem’s status remain unchanged; 35 nations abstained. 
Before the vote, Haley said the U.S. “will remember this day in which it was singled out in this assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,” adding it would remember this day when the U.S. is “called upon” to “make the world’s largest contribution” to the U.N.

21297,2017-12-27,Putin spokesman: legality of Navalny’s election boycott call needs to be examined,"On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s call for a boycott of Russia’s 2018 presidential election needs to be studied to determine whether or not it complies with the law. Navalny called for the boycott after the Russian Central Electoral Commission on Monday declared him ineligible to run for president in 2018 because of a criminal conviction earlier this year.
In February, a Russian court gave Navalny a five-year suspended sentenced for embezzlement. He has denied the charges. Under Russian electoral law, people with a criminal record cannot run for president within 10 years of serving or officially being recognized as having served a sentence.
On Sunday, Navalny gathered the 500 signatures required to register as a presidential candidate, and submitted them to the Central Electoral Commission. After the commission denied his application, Navalny said, “We’re declaring a strike by voters” and said he would lead protests.
President Vladimir Putin was officially nominated for re-election on Tuesday. He will run as an independent candidate in the March presidential election.

21294,2017-12-27,How significant is the 2018-2019 UN budget cut?,"How significant is the 2018-2019 UN budget cut?
After the U.S. Mission to the U.N. announced the organization had agreed to reduce the biennial budget by $285 million, some media outlets suggested the cut was: 1) significant and 2) due to President Trump’s influence. Although we may not know the degree of influence Trump had on the budget cut, we can look at the organization’s budget system, how its funding is allocated and how its budget has changed over time. Adding context to the coverage may help us evaluate the media’s take on the news.
How is the U.N. funded?
Each of the U.N.’s 193-member nations contributes to its biennial budget, which currently starts in January of an even-numbered year (the budget process has changed over time). The amount contributed by each member depends on its gross national income (GNI), conversion rates, national debt and other factors. Overall, each member state funds between 0.001 and 22 percent of the budget.
Here are the top five contributors, based on 2015 data.




Country


U.N. budget contribution




United States


22%




Japan


9.680%




China


7.921%




Germany


6.389%




France


4.859%




The U.N. Committee on Contributions establishes the budget contribution rates, and meets annually to review its methodology.
Members and non-members may also voluntarily contribute to U.N. programs such as the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF). According to the U.N., Japan contributed the most voluntary funds in 2016, at $382,512,042. Voluntary funding contributions are not included in the biennial budget.
What happens if a member state doesn’t contribute?
Under the U.N. charter, if a member state doesn’t pay its dues “in an amount that equals or exceeds the contributions due for two preceding years,” it can lose its ability to vote on U.N. matters in the General Assembly. However, some exceptions may be made for a country that’s unable to pay due to “conditions beyond its control.”
The U.S. has not paid its U.N. dues on time on multiple occasions. For example, the U.S. owed about $1.2 billion to the organization in 2010. The U.S. was also considered “in arrears” to the U.N. in 1998, when it owed about $1 billion, and in 2015 when it owed over $2 billion. In those cases, the U.S. eventually paid its dues and did not lose its voting rights. 
Have there been previous budget cuts?
According to NPR, the U.N.’s 2016-2017 budget was about $400 million less than the funding appropriations for 2014-2015 (a larger reduction that the one agreed upon for 2018-2019). The budget for 2012-2013 was about $260 million less than the budget for 2010-2011. NPR also notes that the countries that contribute the most typically attempt to reduce the U.N.’s budget each biennial. 
“The US fights hard, together with other countries, every year to cut UN budget  below is a sampling of those sections with their corresponding funding appropriation:

32470,2017-12-28,Trump administration dismisses 10 remaining HIV/AIDS council members,"On Dec. 27, 2017, the Trump administration dismissed the remaining 10 members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA). The terminated members could reapply for a position on the council later, according to PACHA’s executive director. Six council members had resigned in June 2017. In a Newsweek op-ed, one of those members, Scott Schoettes, mentioned that one reason for the resignations was President Donald Trump’s decision to not appoint anyone to the White House Office of National AIDS Policy.
PACHA Executive Director Kaye Hayes said the members, officially terminated by the Department of Health and Human Services, were “thanked for their leadership, dedication and commitment to the effort.” Hayes added, “Changing the makeup of federal advisory committee members is a common occurrence during Administration changes.” She also said, “All PACHA members are eligible to apply to serve on the new council that will be convened in 2018.”
Some of the council members were appointees of former President Barack Obama. After Obama was elected, his administration terminated all George W. Bush appointees and made new appointments.
PACHA was created in 1995 under the Clinton administration. PACHA “provides advice, information, and recommendations to the [Health and Human Services] Secretary regarding programs, policies, and research to promote effective treatment, prevention and cure of HIV disease and AIDS.” In September 2017, Trump signed an executive order that renewed 32 presidential advisory committees, including PACHA, for a year.
About 1.2 million people in the U.S. and 37 million worldwide are estimated to have HIV/AIDS, according to Washington Blade.

Nehlen was a contributor to Breitbart, and the media outlet says it has removed his contributor page from its website.
 
 On Tuesday, Nehlen tweeted that he was “currently reading” Kevin MacDonald’s book, The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements. According to Newsweek, the book “blames Jews for anti-Semitic resentment.”
Earlier this month, Nehlen appeared on the podcast Fash the Nation, which CNN describes as a “white nationalist podcast.” On Twitter, Nehlen has used the hashtag “#ItsOkayToBeWhite” and called someone a “(((bigot)))” using “echoes” or three parentheses to identify a person as Jewish. 
When reached for comment, Nehlen told CNN, “Putting America First above all other nations, such as being pro-wall and for freedom of lawful speech, has brought a coordinated attack by globalists from both parties; nevertheless I will continue to stand strong against anti-American sentiment, however it manifests.” 
Nehlen ran against House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in the 2016 Republican primary for the Wisconsin congressional seat. He lost with 16 percent of the vote to Ryan’s 84 percent. According to The Guardian, Nehlen is running for the same seat in 2018. Ryan has not announced whether he will run again.

The suit alleges the department failed to report criminal convictions to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and that compliance might have prevented the shooting.
The gunman, Devin Kelley, was convicted of domestic violence in a military court in 2014 while serving in the U.S. Air Force. All federal agencies, including the military, are required to submit mandatory compliance reports to the NICS containing information on violent crimes. The lawsuit claims Kelley would have been barred from purchasing a gun if the military had reported his case to the NICS. 
A spokesperson for the Justice Department said Attorney General Jeff Sessions has launched an investigation into the matter and is “determining next steps.”

21389,2017-12-28,"US holiday retail sales up 4.9 percent from 2016, MasterCard says","Mastercard SpendingPulse said Tuesday that retail sales increased an estimated 4.9 percent between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 compared to the same period last year. It was the largest year-over-year increase in holiday retail sales since 2011. 
Online sales accounted for between 11 and 12 percent of all purchases during the period, according to Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president at MasterCard. MasterCard estimated the figures based on its credit card activity in stores and online, and based on surveys of purchases made with other forms of payment.
The National Retail Federation, a trade association, said that its final holiday sales data, due in January, would meet or exceed its forecast of $678.8 to $682 billion for the holiday period. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter report on retail e-commerce on Feb. 16, 2018, and its December 2017 advanced monthly retail report on Jan. 12, 2018.
Factors contributing to retail spending
The Wall Street Journal cited analysts and economists saying that the increases in retail sales were due to high consumer confidence and a low unemployment rate.
The Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) was at a 17-year high of 129.5 in November, up from 107.1 last year. The CCI is a calculation that measures consumers’ perceptions of current business and employment conditions, and their expectations about business conditions, employment, and income for the next six months, according to its website. It is based on survey results collected by The Conference Board business group. 
The U.S. unemployment rate was at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October and November. 
Retail spending in 2017
Consumer credit card debt was $757 billion, an increase of 11 percent compared to last year, and its highest level since 2008, according to credit-reporting agency Experian PLC. Credit-card delinquency rates increased in the third quarter of this year. 
Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, estimated that consumers will spend an additional $73 billion between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1.
Nearly 7,000 stores closed this year and bankruptcies increased 30 percent compared to last year, according to CNNMoney.

21447,2017-12-29,Trump tweets he’s ‘disappointed’ after reports of illicit Chinese oil transfers to North Korea,"U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that he was “very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go to North Korea.” His tweet came after media reports that U.S. satellites had photographed 30 instances of Chinese ships allegedly transferring oil to North Korean ships, in violation of U.N. sanctions. When asked about the accusation, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoiqiang said, “the situation you have mentioned absolutely does not exist.”
Fox News reported on the allegations on Wednesday, citing South Korean media outlet The Chosun Ilbo. The Asian outlet reported that South Korean government sources said U.S. satellite photographs showed the alleged illicit transfers. 
“There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen,” Trump tweeted on Thursday. 
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said “the Chinese government has been completely and strictly enforcing Security Council resolutions” pertaining to North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs.
In November, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned six North Korean shipping and trading companies, and 20 of the companies’ ships, “to disrupt North Korea's illicit funding of its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs.” At the same time, the Treasury Department sanctioned three Chinese trading companies it said had been selling non-petroleum goods to North Korea.
In September, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution limiting refined petroleum exports to North Korea to 2 million barrels per year. Last week, the U.N. passed a new resolution limiting that total to 500,000 barrels. It included language that the Security Council would “take action to restrict further the export” of petroleum to North Korea if it performs more intercontinental ballistic missile or nuclear tests. In addition to limiting refined petroleum, the December resolution limited crude oil exports to North Korea to 4 million barrels.

Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said before the signing that Jones “will be sworn in by Vice President Pence on January 3 when the Senate returns.”
Jones beat Republican candidate Roy Moore in a special election to fill U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Senate seat. Jones won by more than 20,000 votes out of the more than 1.3 million votes cast. Moore filed a complaint on Wednesday in Alabama state court requesting the vote certification be delayed on the basis of alleged voter fraud, and that “a new special election” be called. Alabama Circuit Judge Johnny Hardwick dismissed Moore’s complaint, citing a lack of jurisdiction, prior to the vote being certified on Thursday.
Merrill said any citizen could submit allegations of voter fraud that they witnessed. He said his office had made judgements on about 60 of the more than 100 reports of voter fraud that it had received so far.
Prior to the election, Moore was accused of sexual misconduct, including alleged sexual contact with a 14-year-old female when he was 32. He has denied the allegations.

21535,2017-12-30,The 2016 attempted coup in Turkey and relations with the US,"On Dec. 28, the U.S. and Turkey rescinded restrictions on visas issued to each other’s citizens, which had been implemented in October. The U.S. had restricted visa services after Turkey arrested a U.S. consulate staff member over suspected involvement in a failed coup to overthrow the Turkish government in July of last year. To understand how Turkey and the U.S. got to this point, here’s some background on the attempted coup and what happened after it.   
The attempted coup
On July 15, 2016, members of the Turkish military attempted a coup to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The coup failed within hours. In total, 241 people were killed and 2,194 were injured in the attempted coup. 
On July 20 of last year, Turkey declared a state of emergency, which is still in place. 
At the time, then-U.S. President Barack Obama “strongly condemned” the coup attempt. 
What was Turkey’s response?
In the weeks following the attempted coup, Turkey shut down three news agencies, 16 television channels, 23 radio stations, 45 daily newspapers, 15 magazines and 29 publishing houses. 
Since the coup attempt, Turkish authorities have arrested 40,000 people and fired or suspended 120,000 employees for suspected involvement in the coup. These include military generals and admirals.
Who does Turkey say was responsible?
Erdoğan accused Fetullah Gülen of remotely arranging the attempted coup. Gülen is a Turkish cleric who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. He leads a Muslim movement called the Hizmet movement, which means “service.” Hizmet has no formal structure or organization. It has an estimated three to six million followers worldwide. 
After the coup, Turkey arrested people allegedly associated with Gülen’s movement. Gülen denies he was involved in the attempted coup. 
Gülen and Erdoğan
In the past, Gülen’s followers and Erdoğan’s political party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), have worked together. 
In 1999, a video of Gülen was released in which the cleric told followers to “move within the arteries of the system … until you reach all the power centres” and “wait until” they had “all the power of the constitutional institution in Turkey.” 
He was then accused of attempting to undermine Turkey’s secular state. In 1999, Gülen moved to the U.S. Those charges were later dropped in absentia. 
In 2003, Erdoğan became the prime minister, and then the president in 2014. In May 2016, a couple of months before the coup attempt, Turkey declared a group of Gülen’s followers a terrorist organization, and called it the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO). 
How does the U.S. fit in?
After the coup attempt, Turkey requested that Gülen be extradited to Turkey. To date, no U.S. court has ordered Gülen extradited. 
In October of this year, Turkey arrested Metin Topuz, a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate, for alleged connections to FETO. He was the second employee of a U.S. mission in Turkey to be arrested in 2017. 
The U.S. responded by suspending nonimmigrant visa services in Turkey. The same day, Turkey suspended visa services in the U.S. Then on Dec. 28, both countries fully reinstated visa services.",Context|War and Conflict|World,Middle East|USA,,,Turkey,international relations|visas,world_news,publish
21576,2018-01-01,"Iran suspends Telegram, Instagram access after protests","On Sunday, Iran’s IRIB News agency reported that “with a decision by the Supreme National Security Council, activities of Telegram and Instagram are temporarily limited” in the country. State television said the measure to limit access to social media and messaging apps was to “maintain peace,” according to The New York Times. Sunday was the fourth day of protests in Iran against rising food and gasoline prices, according to CNN.
Telegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted on Sunday, “Iranian authorities are blocking access to Telegram for the majority of Iranians” after the company refused to shut down some “peacefully protesting channels.” The day before, Durov tweeted that Telegram suspended one channel, amadnews, as it instructed people to use Molotov cocktails against police, violating Telegram’s “no calls for violence” rule.
According to Al Jazeera, some Iranian Telegram users said on Sunday they could not access the messaging app through cell phone service, but that they could through wifi and home internet connections. CNN reported it was able to contact some Telegram users in Iran through the app, adding that service appeared to be “slower than usual.”
BBC reported that protests began on Thursday in Masshad, Iran’s second-largest city, against “economic hardship and rising prices.” Protests continued through Sunday, including Saturday protests at Tehran University, Fars news agency reported.
Mehr, which Al Jazeera described as a “semi-official Iranian news agency,” reported that a government official said 80 people were detained in Arak on Saturday. Mehr also reported that two protesters died in Dorud on Saturday. Habibollah Khojastepour, Lorestan province's deputy for political and security affairs, did not provide a reason for the deaths, saying police and security forces had not fired at protesters.
According to the Times, witnesses said some groups of protesters have chanted “death to the dictator” and “clerics should get lost,” supposed references to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Iranian Interior Minister Rahmani Fazli said regarding the protests, “those who destroy public properties, create chaos, lawlessness and insecurity in our society, will be held legally responsible and must answer for their behaviors.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, “the people are free to express their criticism and their protest,” and that protests should be towards a “betterment of the conditions for the country.”

21574,2018-01-01,South Korea seizes second ship suspected of illegal trade with North Korea,"On Sunday, South Korean officials seized the KOTI, a ship suspected of violating U.N. sanctions by transferring oil to a North Korean ship. A South Korean maritime office said security officials had prohibited the ship, which was sailing under a Panamanian flag, from leaving the port of Pyeongtaek-Dangjin on Dec. 21, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported. The country’s Foreign Ministry said an investigation of the KOTI was underway. 
The majority of the KOTI’s crew is reportedly from China and Myanmar (Burma). According to CNN, the KOTI can carry 5,100 metric tons of oil. Densities of crude oil and refined petroleum products vary; 5,100 metric tons could correspond, for instance, to about 43,000 barrels of gasoline. A Dec. 22 U.N. resolution limited refined petroleum exports to North Korea to 500,000 barrels per year.
On Friday, South Korea had announced it had seized a ship called the Lighthouse Winmore, which was registered in Hong Kong. The same Dec. 22 resolution allowed member states to seize ships suspected of trading oil and other U.N.-prohibited items with North Korea. The South Korean Foreign Ministry said it suspects the Lighthouse Winmore performed a ship-to-ship transfer of about 600 tons of refined petroleum products to a North Korean vessel in the East China Sea on Oct. 19. A Taiwanese company, the Billions Bunker Group, was leasing the Lighthouse Winmore during the alleged illegal petroleum transfer.
The Associated Press reported that officials are holding and investigating 23 Chinese nationals and two Myanmar nationals from the Lighthouse Winmore in Yeosu, South Korea. According to a South Korean customs official, customs interviewed members of that ship’s crew on Nov. 24. 
Reuters reported the U.S. requested this month that the U.N. ban the Lighthouse Winmore and nine other ships from international waters due to alleged illicit trade with North Korea. The KOTI was not one of those 10 ships.
The Dec. 22 U.N. resolution was the third since Sept. 11 that implemented sanctions on North Korea for its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The Sept. 11 resolution prohibited ship-to-ship trade of prohibited items with North Korea. 
South Korean media reported last week that the U.S. photographed 30 instances of Chinese ships allegedly transferring oil to North Korean ships, in violation of U.N. sanctions. The Chinese foreign ministry said, “the Chinese government has been completely and strictly enforcing Security Council resolutions.”

21630,2018-01-03,South Korea proposes talks with North Korea about participation in Olympic Games,"On Tuesday, South Korea’s unification minister, Cho Myoung-gyon, proposed talks between North and South Korea about the North’s possible participation in next month’s Winter Olympic Games, which are scheduled to take place in the South Korean city of Pyeongchang. In a televised press conference, Myoung-gyon suggested the two countries meet on Jan. 9 in Panmunjom, a village on the border between the two countries, to discuss Olympic cooperation and how to improve overall ties between the two countries.
On Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in his New Year’s address he was willing to send a delegation to the Games. The country has participated in Olympic Games before, though not in Games hosted by South Korea. North Korea has yet to officially respond to Tuesday’s proposal from Myoung-gyon. If the talks happen, they would be the first official talks between North and South Korea since Dec. 2015.
Kim Jong Un also said in Monday’s address that he was “open to dialogue” with the South and asked his neighbors to cease their annual military exercises with the United States. He also commented on the North’s advancements last year in its nuclear program, saying he has a “nuclear button” on his office desk, according to The Associated Press.

21627,2018-01-03,Pakistan summons US ambassador to explain Trump tweet,"Late Monday, Pakistan’s foreign ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador David Hale to explain a tweet from President Donald Trump about Pakistan and its relationship with the United States. The U.S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that David Hale had been to a meeting at the foreign office.
The tweet in question was posted earlier Monday. In it, Trump said, “The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies  deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”
Pakistan’s National Security Committee released a statement saying, “Recent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation.”
A U.S. National Security Council official stated on Monday that the White House “at this time” isn’t planning to send a delayed $255 million aid package to Pakistan, adding that “the administration continues to review Pakistan’s level of cooperation.”

21625,2018-01-03,Israel tells African migrants to leave within 3 months,"On Monday, Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority (PIA) issued a notice to illegal African migrants to leave Israel within 90 days. If they fail to do so, they could be incarcerated, starting in April. The notice exempts children, elderly people and victims of slavery and human trafficking. According to media reports, many of the migrants say they have come to Israel to seek asylum from conflict and persecution in their home countries.
According to the PIA, there are 38,000 Africans in Israel, mainly from Sudan and Eritrea, who did not enter the country through an official border crossing. Of these people, 1,420 are being held in detention centers. Israeli news outlet Haaretz reported that the majority of the migrants have temporary visas that need to be renewed every three months. The next time they expire, authorities will renew them one final time and visa holders will be required to leave before their visa expires.
Israel stated that migrants who leave before the end of March will be given $3,500 and airfare. The PIA said they have the option of returning to their home country or a third country, with Rwanda or Uganda being proposed destinations.
The United Nations refugee agency said the PIA’s notice violates international and Israeli laws. Israel’s government said the migrants’ return will be “voluntary” and humane.

21633,2018-01-03,"At least 21 dead, 450 arrested as Iranian protests continue into sixth day","Protests in Iran have resulted in at least 21 deaths and 450 arrests as of Jan. 2, CNN reported. The protests started in the city of Mashhad last Thursday after prices on various consumer goods increased. Protesters reportedly chanted slogans against government corruption, foreign policy initiatives and economic issues. 
In addition to taking place in Tehran, Iran’s capital, protests have occurred in locations such as Karaj, Qaemshahr, Qazvin, Dorud, Tuyserkan, Khomaini Shahr, Shahinshahr and Izeh. Protesters have attempted to enter police stations and military installations, and attacked a seminary, according to state media. According to The New York Times, people said they would continue protesting; the outlet did not elaborate.
On Monday, a man with a hunting rifle shot at police, killing one officer and wounding three others in the city of Najaf Abad. CNN reported that a member of the pro-government militia Basij was also killed in south Tehran. At least 12 civilian deaths linked to protest activity during the weekend were also reported Monday, and an additional seven deaths on Tuesday.
Ali Asghar Naserbakht, the deputy governor of Iran’s Tehran province, told the ILNA news agency on Tuesday that “200 people were arrested on Saturday, 150 people on Sunday and around 100 people on Monday.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani issued a statement saying, “It should be clear to everyone that we are a free nation and, based on the constitution and citizenship rights, people are completely free in expressing criticisms and even their protests, but at the same time, we must pay attention to the way in which criticism and protest should be made to lead to better conditions for the country and people's lives.” He also noted that protesters “should not allow formation of an atmosphere in which revolution supporters and the people are concerned about their lives and their security.”
While discussing the protests at a weekly meeting with family members of “martyrs of the 8-year Holy Sacred Defense era,” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said, “The enemies of Iran united by using different tools in their disposition, including money, weapons, politics and intelligence, in order to create problems for the Islamic system.”
World leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in favor of the protests. U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for an end to the associated violence.
On Sunday, Iran blocked access to Telegram and Instagram social media apps; the media hasn’t reported on whether the apps have since become available. The Times noted that users can download software to “circumvent” government filters.
Issues protested
Protesters have cited several issues ranging from alleged government corruption and foreign policy initiatives, to various economic concerns. According to The Washington Post, some protesters chanted, “Leave Syria, think about us,” a response to Iran’s financial and military support of the Syrian government and its allies. The following are details on two of the economic concerns protesters have voiced: inflation and unemployment.
Price increases
Inflation is “a sustained increase in the general level of prices for goods and services in a country.” If prices on consumer goods increase overtime, so does the inflation rate.
Iran’s current inflation rate varies slightly by source. For example, the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran puts the current inflation rate at 8.6 percent, which means the average price for consumer goods has increased at an annual rate of 8.6 percent. Other sources place the rate between 9.6 and 10.5 percent. In general, Iran’s inflation rate for 2017 has fluctuated about two percentage points above and below 10 percent. According to TradeEconomics.com, the rate reached an all-time high of 59.02 percent in May 1995 and a record low of -3.27 percent in April 1958.
Unemployment
The country’s 2017 unemployment rate ranges between 12.4 and 12.7 percent. Statista.com notes that Iran’s unemployment rate has stayed above 10 percent for a decade, reaching a high of 14 percent in 2014. The youth unemployment rate was estimated to be about 29.2 percent in the first quarter of 2017.

21692,2018-01-04,Trump responds to Bannon’s comments in new book,"U.S. President Donald Trump issued a statement Wednesday saying former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon “has nothing to do with me or my presidency,” and that “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.” Trump made the comments after The Guardian published excerpts from the book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” by journalist Michael Wolff. In the book, Bannon is quoted as saying he thought a meeting during the campaign between Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer, which lawyers did not attend, was “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who read Trump’s statement in a press briefing Wednesday, said Bannon’s statements about the president, his administration and family were “outrageous” and “completely false.” Bannon has not issued a response to Trump’s or Sanders' statements.
According to The Washington Post, Wolff said Trump knew about the book and the author’s discussions with others about it. Sanders confirmed that Wolff had made about a dozen visits to the White House that had “nothing to do originally with the book,” and that “close to 95 percent” of the visits were requested by Bannon. 
In the statement, Trump said Bannon “spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media,” that he had “little to do with our historic victory,” and that he “doesn’t represent my base—he’s only in it for himself.” Responding to a question on what this “feud” would do to “the President’s base,” Sanders said, “The President’s base is very solid. It hasn’t changed because the President hasn’t and his agenda hasn’t changed.”
On Jan. 4, TIME wrote that Trump’s lawyers reportedly served Bannon with a cease-and-desist letter the previous day “threatening legal damages and demanding that Bannon avoid making defamatory comments about the president and first family as details from an upcoming book begin to be released.”
Bannon became chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign in August 2016 and was appointed chief strategist after Trump won the election. In August 2017, after Bannon resigned and returned to Breitbart News as executive chairman, Trump thanked him “for his service” during the presidential campaign.
When Bannon left the White House, he said, “If there’s any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I’m leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents -- on Capitol Hill, in the media and in corporate America.”

21690,2018-01-04,"51 dead after Peru bus falls off cliff, crashes","At least 51 people were killed Tuesday near Lima, Peru, after a bus fell 330 feet down a cliff onto a beach. The bus, belonging to the San Martín de Porres transport company, carried more than 50 passengers travelling 80 miles south from Huacho to Lima. It collided with a tractor-trailer at a stretch of the road referred to as “Curva del Diablo,” or “Devil’s Bend,” in Pasamayo about 45 miles north of the capital. Six people survived and were taken to the hospital for treatment, including one man who jumped out of a window before the bus dropped off the cliff.
National Police Col. Dino Escudero Alcantara said helicopters and rescue boats sent emergency responders to the site to remove survivors and the deceased. Police confirmed the truck driver was held for questioning, and investigators were reviewing reports that both vehicles were traveling at high speeds before the collision.

21688,2018-01-04,"Former Trump campaign chairman Manafort sues Mueller, Rosenstein","Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against Special Counsel Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The suit alleges they “exceed the scope” of their authority in investigating any links to or coordination between Manafort and Russia, in relation to Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. 
Manafort and Trump campaign aide Rick Gates are charged with money laundering and the making of false statements regarding previous work in Ukraine. Both men pled not guilty on Oct. 12 to criminal charges they face as a result of Mueller’s investigation. They are scheduled for a hearing before a judge on Jan. 16.
The suit filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington alleges Rosenstein went beyond his “authority to appoint a special counsel as well as specific restrictions on the scope of such appointments” in 2017 when he appointed Mueller as special counsel. It also says Rosenstein gave Mueller the authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise from that investigation,” including matters “remote from the specific matter identified as the subject of the appointment order.” The suit claims lobbying work Manafort and Gates did in Ukraine ended in 2014 and was not associated with Trump’s campaign.

21674,2018-01-04,Aviation Safety Network reports zero commercial aviation fatalities in 2017,"There were no fatalities on commercial airline flights anywhere in the world in 2017, the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) and Dutch aviation consultancy To70 reported on Monday. There were fatalities from cargo plane crashes and from two regional airline crashes, in Russia and Angola, said ASN, a Netherlands-based data-collection organization. In total, there were 10 non-commercial crashes, resulting in 44 deaths. 
ASN said last year was the safest for air travel, “both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities.” The organization, which was founded in 1996, did not say when it began keeping records. 
ASN President Harro Ranter said fatalities from plane crashes have been declining since 1997. He said the decline was due to “the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organizations,” citing the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Air Transport Association and the Flight Safety Foundation, “and the aviation industry.”
Trump responds to the air safety record
U.S. President Trump tweeted on Tuesday, “Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!”
When asked about what Trump meant by being “very strict” on aviation, White House spokesman Raj Shah referred to two factors: Trump’s support for privatizing air traffic control and “enhanced security” measures by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
Trump proposed privatizing air traffic control under nonprofit corporations last June; the plan has not been implemented. Four months earlier, in February 2017, Trump called air travel a “regulatory morass that’s a disaster” and said he’d address “burdensome regulations.” 
The Trump administration announced support for new DHS “enhanced security” measures last June. The measures apply to flights from 108 countries and include more screening of passengers and personal electronic devices. 
Most recent crashes in the US 
The most recent air travel fatality in the U.S. was on a foreign carrier in 2013: an Asiana Airlines crash landing at San Francisco International Airport that killed three people. The most recent fatalities on a passenger flight on a U.S.-based airline were in 2009, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. That year, a commuter turboprop aircraft operated by a regional airline crashed near Buffalo, New York.
The last commercial flight operated by a national U.S. airline to crash causing fatalities was on Sept. 11, 2001.

21805,2018-01-05,Trump administration announces plan to allow more offshore oil and gas drilling,"The U.S. Department of the Interior released a plan on Thursday to allow for new areas of offshore oil and gas drilling. The proposal includes areas in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans, as well as the Gulf of Mexico. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the plan was a “draft program” and that “nothing is final yet.” He added that “states, local communities and congressional delegations will all have a say” before the Interior finalizes its plan. 
The Interior’s 2019-2024 five-year plan proposes 47 possible areas where companies can buy leases to drill, including some in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Obama administration’s 2017-2022 plan had 11 lease sales, none of them in the Atlantic or Pacific.
The proposed plan would allow drilling in 90 percent of the outer continental shelf, an area covering 98 percent of U.S. recoverable offshore oil and gas reserves. According to the Interior, the current plan allows drilling in six percent of the outer continental shelf. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates U.S. offshore oil reserves to be 90 billion barrels and natural gas reserves to be 127 trillion cubic feet.
The Interior plans to hold meetings in 2018 to hear public input on the plan.
Reasons given for and against the plan
Zinke said, “Responsibly developing our energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf in a safe and well-regulated way is important to our economy and energy security, and it provides billions of dollars to fund the conservation of our coastlines, public lands and parks.” 
Some politicians oppose new drilling along their states’ shorelines. According to Diane Hoskins, campaign director of the nonprofit group Oceana, this includes both Republican and Democratic governors from New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Oregon and Washington. Florida’s Republican governor Rick Scott also opposes new drilling, saying his concern was protecting his state’s “natural resources.” New Jersey’s Republican governor Chris Christie mentioned beach tourism as a reason for his opposition.
Previous drilling regulations
In December 2016, then-President Barack Obama imposed a ban on drilling in 125 million acres of the Arctic Ocean, and in some areas of the Atlantic Ocean. In April 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order that rescinded Obama’s ban and called for a review of some offshore drilling rules.
On Dec. 28, 2017, the Interior’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) announced a proposal to rescind some of the offshore oil drilling safety regulations put in place by the Obama administration in April 2016. The regulations were introduced after oil company BP’s Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling accident in 2010 that spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, according to The New York Times. 
BSEE Director Scott A. Angelle said the December proposal to rescind some of the safety regulations was designed to reduce a “regulatory burden” on oil companies and encourage more production.

21803,2018-01-05,US Attorney General Sessions rescinds memos on deprioritizing marijuana prosecutions,"On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum that rescinded five Department of Justice (DOJ) memos from the Obama administration on the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses. Some of the rescinded memos had deprioritized the prosecution of marijuana violations in states that had legalized medical or recreational marijuana sales, or when the offense was unrelated to other federal law priorities.
Marijuana use remains illegal under federal law. It has been legalized or decriminalized for medical or recreational purposes under some state laws. 
The DOJ statement said rescinding the memos was a return of “local control” to federal prosecutors. Sessions said, “today’s memo on federal marijuana enforcement” directs “U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country.” The DOJ described it as a “return to the rule of law.”
The five rescinded memos were written between 2009 and 2014. James M. Cole, then-Deputy Attorney General, issued two of those memos to all U.S. attorneys: the “Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement” on Aug. 29, 2013, and the “Guidance Regarding Marijuana Related Financial Crimes” on Feb. 14, 2014. Two more of the memos, dated 2009 and 2011, was related to medical marijuana. The final memo, dated 2014, dealt with marijuana in “Indian Country.” 
There is “parallel” guidance from the Treasury Department to the 2014 DOJ memo on financial crimes, Politico reported. That guidance, which remains in place, relates to the deprioritization of prosecution of banks that do business with marijuana sellers who comply with state laws.
According to nonprofit organization NORML, whose mission includes legalizing “the responsible use of marijuana by adults,” eight states and the District of Columbia have laws legalizing personal marijuana use, and an additional 14 states have laws decriminalizing its use.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the security aid would be suspended “until the Pakistani Government takes decisive action against groups, including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network.” She said the U.S. considers the groups to be “destabilizing the region and also targeting U.S. personnel.”
Nauert did not provide a dollar amount for the suspended aid in her announcement. The New York Times cited unnamed administration officials saying as much as $1.3 billion in aid could be suspended.
The suspension includes Coalition Support Funds, which is aid that the U.S. Department of Defense gives to Pakistan for counterterrorism operations, according to The New York Times. 
The Trump administration announced on Monday that it was delaying $255 million in Foreign Military Assistance aid to Pakistan and reviewing Pakistan’s “level of cooperation” in countering terrorism.
According to U.S. President Donald Trump, for the last 15 years, the U.S. has given Pakistan a total of more than $33 billion in aid.

21799,2018-01-05,French President Macron proposes law to counter ‘fake news’,"French President Emmanuel Macron said this week that he would introduce a law to counter “fake news” on social media during French election campaigns. Macron said the new law would require websites to publish who sponsored their content, and impose a limit on the amount of money spent on sponsored content. He said authorities may be granted emergency legal powers to remove content or block “fake news” websites. The president said the measure was to “protect liberal democracies.”
Macron said on Wednesday that with his new law, a government agency would have power to act against “any attempt at destabilization” by television stations under foreign influence or control. He said “freedom of the press” would remain preserved under the new law. Macron said his goal is to get the law passed by the National Assembly by year’s end.
The president said details of the plan would be released in the coming weeks. 
Macron won the presidential election in the spring of 2017. He said that during the campaign, Russia Today and Sputnik news agencies had published false news stories about him.

21950,2018-01-08,11 Saudi princes arrested after Riyadh protest on suspension of royal subsidies,"On Saturday, Saudi Arabia’s attorney general said 11 Saudi princes were arrested after they protested at a palace in Riyadh on Thursday. The attorney general’s statement said the princes objected to a government measure suspending subsidies that cover royal families’ water and electricity bills. The princes also reportedly sought compensation for the execution of a cousin convicted of murder in 2016. According to Reuters, the princes were charged with disturbing public peace and order.
Saudi Attorney General Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said in his statement that the princes were told their demands were not lawful and that they “refused to leave the area, disrupting public peace and order. Members of security services stepped in to restore order and the princes were arrested.”
The princes were protesting at the Qasr a-Hokm palace, and authorities took them to al-Hayer prison, where they are to remain awaiting trial. 
Economic statistics and reforms
The suspension of subsidies is one of several changes to Saudi economic policy that also includes the implementation of a value-added tax (VAT). Reuters reported that the reforms are designed to increase government revenue to offset a budget deficit caused by a decrease in crude oil prices.  
Saudi Arabia implemented a five percent VAT on Jan. 1 of this year, in accordance with a 2016 agreement by the Gulf Cooperation Council (which includes six nations: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait). Food, clothes, electronics, utility bills and other commodities are among the taxed items. The agreement was made to move towards a “unified regional economy,” and in Saudi Arabia, “to improve fiscal sustainability and diversify government revenues.” 
Petroleum accounts for about 87 percent of budget revenues in Saudi Arabia, according to Forbes. The country is the world’s largest oil exporter. The average annual price of Brent crude oil was $52.32 per barrel in 2015 and $43.64 in 2016. For comparison, the average price was $108.56 per barrel in 2013 and $98.97 in 2014. Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia’s expected budget deficit in 2018 is 195 billion riyals ($53 billion).
King Salman issued a royal decree this week that aims to offset costs that have increased due to the VAT and higher gasoline prices, Reuters reported. The decree’s measures include: 

	giving government employees a cost-of-living allowance of 1,000 riyals ($266) per month for one year;
	giving military personnel in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen a one-time payment of 5,000 riyals ($1,333);
	increasing students’ stipends by 10 percent for one year;
	increasing social security stipends by 500 riyals ($133) per month for one year;
	excluding from the VAT purchases of private healthcare and education;
	excluding from the VAT first-time homeowners’ property purchases up to 850,000 riyals ($226,660).

The unemployment rate for Saudis in the country was 12.8 percent for the third quarter of 2017. It was 11.8 percent for the first half of 2014, after a period of about three years with average oil prices roughly double what they were in 2017.
CNN said Saudi officials estimate the country has lost more than $100 billion due to corruption and embezzlement “over decades.” Crown Prince and heir to the Saudi throne Mohammed bin-Salman leads an anti-corruption committee formed last November that has detained more than 200 officials, according to Reuters. Authorities reportedly released some of those detained after they agreed to financial settlements.

21934,2018-01-08,Israel bans entry for members of 20 groups that advocate boycotting the country,"Members of 20 groups that publicly advocate boycotting Israel have been prohibited from entering into the country, according to a list Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs published on Sunday. The foreign groups are part of the Palestinian-led BDS movement, which stands for “boycott, divest, and sanction,” and advocates economic, cultural or academic boycotts of Israel over its settlements in the West Bank. The movement also advocates Israelis comply with international laws pertaining to policies on Palestinians, according to The Washington Post. 
Israel reportedly introduced the list of prohibited groups after its parliament passed a law in March to deny visas to foreign nationals who publicly advocate boycotting Israel. Until Sunday, the Ministry of Strategic Affairs and the Interior Ministry had declined to publicly disclose the list of organizations. A joint team from both ministries had determined the parameters for barring activists from entry on these grounds. To date, multiple people have been refused entry to Israel for connections to the BDS movement, Haaretz reported. 
Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said, “The state of Israel will actively prevent such groups from spreading their falsehoods and odious methods from within the country.” He said the groups would not be allowed to enter and “harm” Israel’s citizens. The Interior Minister, Arye Dery, said the barred people were trying to “defame” Israel.
Some of the banned organizations responded with public statements. U.S.-based organization Jewish Voice for Peace said on social media the measure was part of an “erosion of democratic norms.” The CEO for New Israel Fund, also based in the U.S., said the group opposes “the government’s travel ban and all its actions to punish those with whom it disagrees.”
Banned organizations are primarily from Europe and the U.S. Here is a full list:

21931,2018-01-08,"Tanker on fire, 32 crew members missing after collision off Chinese coast","An Iranian oil tanker collided with a Chinese freight ship late Saturday, causing the tanker to catch fire and oil to spill into the East China Sea, Chinese authorities said. All 32 of the tanker’s crew members are missing. The head of Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization, Mohammad Rastad, said bad weather conditions and the fire on and around the ship were adversely affecting the rescue operation.
The Panama-registered tanker, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Co., was carrying Iranian oil en route to South Korea when it collided with the Chinese ship 160 miles (257 km) off the coast of Shanghai, according to China’s Ministry of Transport. The Chinese ship, the CF Crystal, received “non-critical” damage and all 21 of its crew members are accounted for, according to the Chinese Ministry of Transportation.
China dispatched four police boats to search for the missing crew and three cleaning ships to the scene as of 9:00 am local time on Sunday morning, the ministry said. South Korea also dispatched a ship and a helicopter to aid in the operation. The fire was still burning as of 1:00 pm local time, according to a South Korean coast guard official.
The tanker was carrying 136,000 metric tonnes (150,000 tons, or almost 1 million barrels) of a type of light crude called condensate, Chinese authorities said. According to Reuters, that amount is worth about $60 million, based on global crude prices. Chinese authorities have not provided details about the size of the spill. It was not known if the tanker is continuing to leak, The Associated Press reported on Sunday. 
The cause of the accident has not been determined, according to AP.

22002,2018-01-09,Syrian government troops take control of 14 villages in northern Syria,"Syrian government forces took control of 14 villages in northern Syria on Monday. The Associated Press said the troops’ principle aim is to reach the opposition-held Abu Zuhour air base and secure the road linking Syria’s capital, Damascus, with its largest city, Aleppo.
The villages were previously held by opposition groups, among them the Levant Liberation Committee, which has been linked to al-Qaeda. Since late October, Syrian forces and their allies have campaigned to retake the northern Hama and Idlib provinces, the last two opposition-held provinces in the country. Russian forces and airstrikes are supporting the troops in this campaign.
Idlib and parts of Hama have been designated as “de-escalation zones” in accordance with a Russian-supported agreement between the Syrian government and opposition fighters. The agreement aims to reduce violence in Syria and calls for a cessation of fighting in those zones. CNN reported that government airstrikes and violence by opposition fighters are both in violation of this agreement.
The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 people were killed and dozens wounded in an explosion in Idlib on Sunday. The Observatory also said 159 government soldiers and opposition fighters have been killed during fighting over the Murakabat base outside Damascus since Dec. 29.
The IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation said an estimated 100,000 civilians have left their homes in Hama province for the Turkish border in the past week, CNN reported.

22000,2018-01-09,Iran bans English lessons in primary schools,"Iran has banned the teaching of English in primary schools. Supreme Education Council Secretary Mehdi Navid-Adham announced late on Saturday that “teaching English in government and non-government primary schools in the official curriculum is against laws and regulations.” 
Iran’s Education Ministry secretary told state media that the ministry “envisages strengthening Persian language skills and Iranian Islamic culture of pupils at the primary school stage.” Reuters said the decision came after Islamic leaders said learning English early “opened the way to a Western ‘cultural invasion.’” The ban does not include secondary schools or private institutions that teach English outside the state-run education system.
BBC noted English language lessons are taught at the secondary school level in Iran, which begins at age 12, and that their “popularity” has led to English lessons being offered to younger students as well.
In a 2016 speech given to teachers, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the teaching of English “spreading” to nursery schools, and said such developments were part of a Western idea of instilling ""thought and culture to the younger generation of countries.” In the same speech, Khamenei reportedly said, “That does not mean opposition to learning a foreign language, but (this is the) promotion of a foreign culture in the country and among children, young adults and youths.”

The company’s statement described the decision as an attempt to better position itself ""to bring new therapies to patients who need them."" The decision was made “after once-promising compounds failed during testing,” according to The Wall Street Journal. The company said it would cut about 300 jobs as a result of the decision at laboratories in Cambridge and Andover, Massachusetts, and in Groton, Connecticut.

The company added that it is planning to ""create a dedicated neuroscience venture fund to support continued efforts to advance the field.""
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are both neurodegenerative diseases that damage memory and motor functions, respectively. There is currently no known cure for either disease. There are an estimated 5.5 million people with Alzheimer’s, and about half a million with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S.

22043,2018-01-10,Steve Bannon resigns from Breitbart,"On Tuesday, former White House advisor Stephen K. Bannon resigned as executive chairman of Breitbart News Network. A Breitbart statement said, “Bannon and Breitbart will work together on a smooth and orderly transition.” Bannon’s resignation came after Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury” was released this week, which attributes disparaging remarks to Bannon about members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s family.
In a statement on Breitbart’s website, Bannon said, “I’m proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform.” Breitbart CEO Larry Solov said, “Steve is a valued part of our legacy, and we will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish.”
In Wolff’s book, Bannon is quoted as saying he thought a meeting during the campaign between Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russian representatives, was “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” After the media published these quotes, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a statement in which he said, “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency.”
Bannon became executive chairman at Breitbart in 2012. Bannon left Breitbart after he joined Trump’s presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump was elected, he became a White House advisor. Bannon resigned from the Trump administration and returned to Breitbart in August 2017.

22041,2018-01-10,"North Korea to send delegation to Olympics, hold further talks with South","North and South Korea announced after talks on Tuesday that North Korea would be sending a delegation to next month’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The delegation will include athletes, cheerleaders, art performers and a taekwondo demonstration team. North Korea is planning to send media and spectators as well. Both also agreed to hold military talks regarding their border, and reinstate a military hotline that North Korea suspended two years ago.
The South also said it may coordinate with the U.N. to temporarily lift certain U.N. sanctions against the North, in order to aid North Korea’s participation in the Games.
Five North and five South Korean senior officials met before the announcement for a day of talks in Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries. North Korean president Kim Jong-un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in reportedly watched the talks via closed caption television.
Prior to Tuesday's meeting, Kim gave a New Year’s speech this year in which he said North Korea may send a delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics. The South then proposed the countries meet for talks. North Korea agreed to Tuesday’s talks with the South after the U.S. announced on Jan. 4 that it would delay its annual joint military exercises with South Korea until after the Games.
According to The Washington Post, only two North Korean athletes had qualified for this year’s Games, both figure skaters. North Korea has participated in the Olympics since 1972. It boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
The last time senior officials from the two countries talked was in 2015. After North Korea performed missile and nuclear tests that year, South Korea suspended a joint economic project with the North. The North responded by ending communication with the South.

22039,2018-01-10,"13 dead, more than 6,000 evacuated after Southern California rain causes mudflows, flooding","At least 13 people were killed Tuesday after rain led to flooding and mudflows in parts of Southern California. Santa Barbara County fire spokesman Mike Eliason said at least six homes near Montecito were “wiped away from their foundations” by mudflows. Crews have rescued 50 people by air and more than a dozen from the ground, The Los Angeles Times reported.
The National Weather Service reported the rate of rain was 1.5 inches per hour on Tuesday morning in areas of Southern California. Robbie Monroe of the National Weather Service said about half an inch of rain per hour is sufficient to start a mudslide.
The rain fell in areas affected by recent wildfires including the Thomas Fire, which began in December and has burned more than 281,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. It was 92 percent contained as of Tuesday, according to CNN. According to The Los Angeles Times, heat from the fires can affect how efficiently the soil absorbs water.
County spokeswoman Gina DePinto said officials ordered the evacuation of more than 6,000 people in Santa Barbara County. Some of these were residents of Carpinteria, Montecito and Goleta who lived below areas burned by wildfires in the past year and a half. She said another 20,000 people in the county were given voluntary evacuation warnings. Los Angeles County officials ordered evacuations for about 300 homes in areas affected by the Creek Fire.
A more than 30 mile section of U.S. Route 101 between Santa Barbara and Ventura was closed due to mudslides, according to the California Highway Patrol.

22020,2018-01-10,US to end temporary protected status for El Salvador in 2019,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Monday it will terminate El Salvador’s Temporary Protected Status (TPS) on Sept. 9, 2019. The DHS indicated Salvadorans could in the interim leave the U.S. or ""seek an alternative lawful immigration status” in the country, if eligible. 
DHS officials said 262,500 Salvadorans have been granted TPS since 2001. Close to 200,000 Salvadorans currently reside in the U.S. under TPS. Salvadoran Foreign Minister Hugo Martínez said the country will spend the next 18 months lobbying the U.S. Congress for a permanent solution to the issue.
TPS was originally signed into law by President George Bush in 1990, and El Salvador participated in the program in 1994 because of its civil war. The designation was reissued for El Salvador following the 2001 earthquakes that killed more than 1,200 people and destroyed about 150,000 homes. TPS allowed illegal Salvadorans residing in the U.S. before the earthquakes to apply for protected status, allowing them to obtain work permits and prevent deportation. To remain and work in the U.S., TPS beneficiaries must renew permits every 18 months.
The DHS’ statement said the U.S. has repatriated more than 39,000 Salvadorans in the past two years, and “that the temporary inability of El Salvador to adequately return their nationals after the earthquake has been addressed.” 
The statement also said, “Only Congress can legislate a permanent solution addressing the lack of an enduring lawful immigration status of those currently protected by TPS who have lived and worked in the United States for many years,” adding that, “the 18-month delayed termination will allow Congress time to craft a potential legislative solution.”
El Salvador’s government has said TPS workers bring benefits to the U.S. economy. This weekend, the Foreign Ministry tweeted that “95 percent of Salvadorans in the program are employed or own their own businesses.” The World Bank estimated that TPS remittances to El Salvador surpass $4.5 billion a year, which accounts for about 17 percent of the country’s GDP.
Opponents of the decision have cited concerns over violence and gangs in the country, and a “potentially destabilizing effect of so many people being sent home,” according to The Washington Post. One estimate says El Salvador had the world’s second highest murder rate in 2016, with 64.2 murders per 100,000 population. The same estimate indicates about 60 percent of murders are due to gang activity. 
Opponents also cited concerns regarding the more than 192,000 U.S.-born children of TPS beneficiaries, should their parents or relatives be deported. 
Proponents of the decision said it will open jobs to U.S. citizens and other lawful residents, and that those who return to El Salvador would bring with them skills and resources that could have a positive impact on the economy.
In November, Haiti’s and Nicaragua’s TPS was also terminated. Honduras’ TPS was extended by six months in December.

22138,2018-01-11,New York City sues five oil companies alleging contributions to climate change,"On Wednesday, New York City announced a lawsuit against oil companies BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, says “the City seeks to shift the costs of protecting the City from climate change impacts back onto the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat.” The city’s Mayor Bill de Blasio and Comptroller Scott Stringer also announced on Wednesday the city has plans to divest $5 billion in fossil fuel investments within five years, from five pension funds valued at $189 billion.
De Blasio said the defendants in the suit “intentionally misled the public to protect their profits,” and that “it’s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.” The Guardian wrote that the suit will point to “evidence that firms such as Exxon knew of the impact of climate change for decades, only to downplay and even deny this in public.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is reportedly investigating Exxon over this allegation.
The lawsuit claims that New York City has had flooding and erosion as a result of climate change. It also claims that two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution have been created by 100 fossil fuel companies, and that the defendants are the largest contributors.
An Exxon spokesperson said, “reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,” and that “lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life — simply do not do that.”
A spokesperson for Chevron said the lawsuit was “factually and legally meritless,” and that it “only serves special interests.” Shell called climate change “a complex societal challenge” that should be addressed “through sound government policy and cultural change,” and not in court. Conoco and BP did not comment.
San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz in California have filed similar suits against the same five companies. The lawsuits are pending. The Guardian also reported that two California counties are suing 37 fossil fuel companies for their alleged involvement in emitting greenhouse gases. Michael Burger, executive director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said no city has successfully sued a fossil-fuel company for climate change damages. 
Regarding the divestment, Stringer said that “safeguarding the retirement of our city’s police officers, teachers and firefighters is our top priority, and we believe that their financial future is linked to the sustainability of the planet.” The Wall Street Journal reported that trustees of the city’s five major pension funds must approve the divestment, and that some funds may implement the proposal and others may not.
Other cities and organizations — such as Washington D.C., Stanford University and The Rockefeller Brothers Fund — have also sought to divest. Financial Times wrote that pension funds have begun withdrawing from fossil fuel companies “over concerns about their impact on climate change and fears” that they could lose value if governments enact stricter climate-change rules and regulations.
The vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, Kyle Isakower, has said divestment is a “tactic of misinformed activists” that is “incompatible with job creation, affordable energy and economic prosperity.”

22143,2018-01-11,Federal judge rules DACA to continue while litigation is pending,"On Tuesday, a federal judge in California ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program must stay intact while litigation on U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to repeal it is pending. U.S. District Judge William Alsup specified that the Trump administration must allow beneficiaries to apply to renew work permits, but that it does not need to receive or process new applications.
On Sept. 6, 15 states filed a lawsuit in New York’s Eastern District against the administration’s decision to end DACA. The lawsuit claims a repeal violates due process, has a “discriminatory motive” against Latin Americans and that deporting beneficiaries covered under DACA negatively affects states’ economies.
According to Reuters, about 700,000 individuals are protected from deportation under DACA. “Dreamers,” as they are referred to, must qualify as undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

22146,2018-01-11,Trump administration approves sale of anti-ballistic missiles to Japan valued at $133M,"A U.S. State Department statement on Tuesday confirmed the Trump administration approved a proposed sale of SM-3 anti-ballistic missiles to Japan, and asked Congress to approve the sale. Included in the deal by Raytheon Co and BAE Systems are four Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA anti-ballistic missiles, four MK 29 missile canisters, and logistical, technical and engineering support services. The deal is valued at an estimated $133.3 million. A State Department official said the potential sale would enhance Japan’s Maritime Self Defense Force’s ability to “defend Japan and the Western Pacific from ballistic missile threats.”
On Aug. 29, North Korea launched a ballistic missile that flew over Japan for the first time since 2009, after which Japan called a meeting with the U.N. Security Council. On Nov. 29, the North launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, saying the missile “meets the goal of the completion of the rocket weaponry system development” and that it was capable of striking the U.S. mainland. 
In December, Japan formally decided to use U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors to expand its defense system. According to Japan’s state broadcaster NHK, last month, Japan’s cabinet approved a plan for the country to purchase two U.S.-built Aegis missile defense systems. A U.S. State Department official confirmed Wednesday that the SM-3 Block IIA missile in the proposed sale can be deployed on land or on Aegis-class destroyers.

The raids resulted in 21 arrests in 17 states. ICE said it temporarily closed stores to conduct interviews at 6 a.m. and that it arrested individuals in violation of immigration laws, including undocumented workers. Derek Benner, executive associate director for ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations, told The Associated Press there would be more “large-scale compliance inspections” this year.  
The company released a statement saying it requires 7-Eleven franchise business owners “to comply with all federal, state and local employment laws” and that it has “terminated franchise agreements with franchisees convicted of violating these laws.”
An ICE spokesperson said store managers and owners served on Wednesday will have three days to provide employee immigration status information. Arrests occurred at stores located in California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington state and Washington, D.C. According to the company’s website, 7-Eleven has more than 60,000 stores worldwide.
In 2013, ICE conducted a similar operation in which it arrested nine 7-Eleven franchise owners and charged them with “conspiring to commit wire fraud, stealing identities and concealing and harboring illegal aliens employed at their stores.”

22207,2018-01-12,US House votes to renew FISA warrantless surveillance program,"The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendment Act (FISA) for six years. The bill would allow the U.S. government to continue to collect data on “non-U.S. persons” outside the country, without a warrant. It allows intelligence agencies to obtain data in emails and phone calls from companies like Google and ATT that collect such information. The bill passed 256-164. It will now be sent to the Senate.
The House voted against an amendment to the bill that would have required warrants in some cases for intelligence agencies to read Americans’ communications with “non-U.S. persons” who are under surveillance. The term “non-U.S. persons” includes foreigners without permanent residency in the U.S. The Trump administration opposed the amendment, which failed to pass the House by a vote of 183-233. 
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is a co-sponsor of a Senate version of the amendment rejected by the House. On Thursday, he tweeted, “No American should have their right to privacy taken away! #FILIBUSTER."" 
Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to legalize a warrantless surveillance program that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to The New York Times. The original FISA Act passed in 1978.
FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said section 702 of the FISA Act is a “valuable tool to fight terrorism.”
Trump’s tweets before the vote
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted at 7:33 a.m. ET on Thursday: “House votes on controversial FISA ACT today. This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?”
At 9:14 a.m. ET on Thursday, Trump tweeted, “With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!” 
The bill passed before noon.
Background on the ‘unmasking process’
Trump’s tweet mentioned an “unmasking process.” Under Section 702 of FISA, the identities of Americans whom foreigners are speaking with or about may be “masked” in intelligence reports. The “unmasking” refers to senior government officials asking an intelligence agency to reveal the names of Americans or U.S. entities in a piece of intelligence to better understand the information. 
Trump alleged that the Obama administration had used the unmasking process to obtain information on Trump’s presidential transition team. White House cybersecurity coordinator Rob Joyce said there have “been no cases of 702 used improperly for political purposes.”
CNN reported that a FISA warrant was used to surveil former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort in 2016. The FISA program was used to “unmask” former national security adviser Michael Flynn when he was communicating with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., according to Business Insider.

22209,2018-01-12,"UK’s May announces 25-year environmental plan, including plastic waste reduction","On Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May announced a 25-year plan for the environment that includes eliminating all “avoidable” plastic wastes by 2042. The plan includes extending a 5 pence tax on plastic bags to apply to all retailers. It also proposes a possible charge on single-use plastic containers and the creation of “plastics-free” aisles at supermarkets where items would not be packaged in plastic.
The environment department headed by Michael Gove authored the plan and published it on Thursday. It also includes proposals for government-funded research on plastics innovation and government aid to developing nations to reduce plastic waste and pollution.
May said that plastic waste can end up in waterways and oceans, and that one third of fish caught in the English Channel contain some pieces of plastic in them. She said she would lobby leaders at a Commonwealth summit in April for a charter by the member states of the Commonwealth of Nations to reduce plastic waste in oceans. The Commonwealth of Nations is a group of 52 states, mostly former-British colonies, which includes Canada and Australia.
“Today I can confirm that the UK will demonstrate global leadership. We must reduce the demand for plastic, reduce the number of plastics in circulation and improve our recycling rates,” Conservative party leader May said while announcing the plan.  
Greenpeace noted that the plan did not contain a deposit return program for plastic bottles. The government had said it would consider such a program. 
Friends of the Earth, a non-governmental environmental organization, said a “clear timetable” for the 25-year plan was needed. Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said 25 years was “far too long” to take action.
The plan is not yet part of any legislation.

22211,2018-01-12,Trump administration to allow states to add work requirements to Medicaid,"The U.S. Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on Thursday that it would allow individual states to require certain people to work in order to receive Medicaid. CMS sent a letter to state Medicaid directors saying that the new policy is designed to “assist states in their efforts to improve Medicaid enrollee health and well-being through incentivizing work and community engagement.”
Currently, Medicaid recipients are not required to work or be employed to receive benefits. In order to waive provisions of federal Medicaid programs, states must submit proposals for “experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects” and have them approved by CMS. 
CMS said that it would support state demonstration projects that require at least 20 hours per week of work, “skills training, education, job search, volunteering or caregiving” for Medicaid recipients who were “able-bodied, working-age adults.” These requirements would not apply to elderly Medicaid recipients, children, pregnant women, or those whose benefits were due to a disability. 
CMS Administrator Seema Verma said 10 states have submitted demonstration project proposals: Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin. According to Politico, Mississippi has also submitted a proposal.
Some Democrats and advocacy groups have said they would sue to block any new work requirement plans that CMS approves, Politico reported.
Medicaid recipients
There are more than 70 million Medicaid recipients. Some states received federal waivers to test new ideas on how to administer the program.
A study by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation determined that about 60 percent of working-age Medicaid recipients are currently employed either full- or part-time. Some of the working recipients’ employers do not offer health insurance. According to the study, the majority who were not working said they were ill, caring for a family member, or attending a school.
The Medicaid program was started 52 years ago. In 2014, the Affordable Care Act allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to people who lived up to 38 percent above the federal poverty line. Thirty-one states extended coverage in this way.

22213,2018-01-12,"Walmart to increase its minimum hourly wage to $11, give bonuses, close 63 Sam’s Club stores","Walmart announced on Thursday it would increase its minimum hourly wage to $11 in February for all hourly employees in the U.S. The company also said it would give hourly employees one-time bonuses of between $200 and $1,000, depending on seniority. Walmart said it expects the wage increase to cost $300 million for its next fiscal year, which starts Feb. 1, and the bonuses to cost $400 million. Walmart also announced on Thursday that it would close 63 Sam’s Club stores, converting about a dozen of them into distribution centers.
Sam’s Club has not announced how many employees would be affected by the closures. 
In addition to the minimum wage increase and bonuses, Walmart announced other benefit increases. These include: financial assistance for full-time employees who are looking to adopt children, 10 weeks of paid maternity leave or six weeks paid paternity leave for full-time hourly employees, and six weeks paid paternity leave for salaried employees.
The federal minimum hourly wage has been $7.25 since 2009. States have individually raised their minimum wages, with some already at $11 per hour. In 2015, Walmart raised its minimum hourly wage to $9, and in 2016 to $10 for workers who complete a training course.
As a comparison, Target announced in October that it would increase minimum hourly wage for its workers to $11, and to $15 by the end of 2020.
Last month, the U.S. passed a tax reform law that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said, “Tax reform gives us the opportunity to be more competitive globally and to accelerate plans for the U.S.”

22196,2018-01-12,Divest to protest: A brief look at the financial protest movement,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently announced the city’s plan to divest $5 billion of its pension funds from “fossil fuel reserve owner companies.” During the mayor’s press conference, Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), noted divestment’s purported role in ending apartheid in South Africa.
Divesting funds from companies for moral or political reasons is a concept called “protest divestment.” Below, we’ll explore the concept in the context of South Africa, its perceived effectiveness and some current examples. This framework can help evaluate the effects New York City’s proposed measure may or may not have on oil companies and the use of fossil fuels.
What’s protest divestment?
According to Investopedia, protest divestment involves selling a large amount of stock or other assets, such as real estate, in an effort to put “financial pressure on a corporation or government to force social change.”
How did it factor into apartheid?
Media outlets have used the end of apartheid in South Africa as an example of protest divestment use. Apartheid was a system of legislation in South Africa that, among other things, segregated its population by race, prohibited mixed-race marriages, and required non-whites to carry documents granting them permission to enter certain restricted areas. South Africa had aspects of this system in place between 1950 and 1994, when a new constitution took effect.
In the 1980s, college students, religious groups and other public organizations outside South Africa began to call on institutions to divest from companies that did business with the country. Schools such as the University of California, Yale University and Harvard University agreed to divest fully or partially their assets in South Africa, as did companies such as General Motors and IBM.
Economists who have studied the issue have concluded that divestment likely did not have a significant role in ending apartheid. Economists Siew Hong Teoh, Ivo Welch and C. Paul Wazzan studied the impact of U.S. divestments on South Africa and found that they had “little discernible effect on the valuation of banks and corporations with South African financial markets.”
Other factors, such as Nelson Mandela’s anti-apartheid movement, likely contributed more to the eventual end of apartheid. These factors also include sanctions on South Africa from countries such as the U.S., as well as various rights groups that protested and boycotted the South African government for at least four decades. In 1986, the U.S. passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which encouraged South Africa to release political prisoners, including Mandela, and to establish a timetable for eliminating apartheid laws.
How effective is divestment?
As noted above, the financial impact of divesting may be minimal. Rebecca Leber of The New Republic wrote that divestment can be a tactic for “driving home the message of the broader campaign.” According to New Yorker contributor William MacAskill, divestment campaigns may be more effective as a “stigmatization” tool, rather than a means to financially “pressure” a large company or industry. MacAskill uses the following example to illustrate this:
Suppose that the market price for a share in ExxonMobil is ten dollars, and that, as a result of a divestment campaign, a university decides to divest from ExxonMobil, and it sells the shares for nine dollars each. What happens then? Well, what happens is that someone who doesn’t have ethical concerns will snap up the bargain. They’ll buy the shares for nine dollars apiece, and then sell them for ten dollars to one of the other thousands of investors who don’t share the university’s moral scruples. The market price stays the same; the company loses no money and notices no difference.
What are other examples of divestment campaigns?
In addition to divesting to protest apartheid, and oil and gas companies, groups have also used it to protest tobacco, coal and gun companies. Below are a few examples of those campaigns.
Tobacco
In the 1980s, members of the American Medical Association requested that the organization divest stocks in tobacco companies, citing the potential inconsistency of a health organization funding tobacco. During that time, medical professionals also campaigned for medical schools to divest. In 1990, Harvard divested $40 million from tobacco companies, and the City University of New York divested about $3.5 million worth of tobacco stock after a board member argued against funding “unhealthy” tobacco. Around the same time, the Boston-based Tobacco Divestment Project was founded to lobby companies to divest from the tobacco industry.
Divestment campaigns against the tobacco industry exist today as well. In 2010, the Norwegian government divested about $2.56 billion from tobacco companies for ethical reasons. The Dutch pension fund ABP recently announced plans to divest $4 billion from tobacco companies and nuclear weapons manufacturers. ABP Chairman Erik van Houwelingen said the investments had been a “dilemma” for some time, and that “changes in society” contributed to the decision to divest.
Guns
In 2016, the New York City Employees’ Retirement System voted to divest about $10.5 million in shares from retailers such as Dick’s Sporting Goods that sell guns to the public. A public spokesperson said, “We will no longer do business with companies that fund the deaths of our family members and friends.” In 2013, the Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund board voted to divest $146,000 from two gun companies.
Celebrities such as Snoop Dogg, Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner and NBA Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes have also publicly declared their intent to divest from gun companies to protest gun violence.
Coal
In November, The Guardian reported that 15 insurance companies had divested about £15 billion (about $20.3 billion) from the coal industry over the past two years. Johns Hopkins and Columbia universities also recently announced plans to divest. 
Columbia University’s trustees voted to divest from companies deriving more than 35 percent of their revenue from thermal coal production, and to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s Climate Change Program to demonstrate its “longstanding commitment to climate change.” Trustees of Johns Hopkins, which had divested from tobacco in 1991, said its decision to divest from “thermal coal” was based on advocacy from student groups who had lobbied for the change for two years. Additionally, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System board voted to divest from U.S. coal companies last year.
Oil
New York City’s isn’t the only government looking to divest funds from the oil industry. Norway has proposed selling $35 billion in oil and natural gas stocks; the final decision may not be made until fall 2018, according to Norway’s Finance Ministry. “Our perspective here is to spread the risks for the state’s wealth,” Egil Matsen, the deputy central bank governor overseeing the fund, said in an interview in Oslo. “We can do that better by not adding oil-price risk.” 
The Rockefeller Family Fund announced in 2016 that it divested from Exxon and planned to divest from other fossil-fuel companies after it said Exxon had allegedly “misled the public” about climate change.

22282,2018-01-14,The Goldwater Rule and how it’s interpreted,"This week, President Donald Trump tweeted that his “two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.” The tweets came after journalist Michael Wolff’s newly-released book “Fire and Fury” included criticisms of the president’s mental capacity. Throughout his presidency, journalists, politicians and psychiatrists have commented on Trump’s mental health, and this has led to debate about the Goldwater Rule and whether psychiatric evaluations of public figures violate professional ethics. Let’s take a look.
What is the Goldwater Rule?
During the 1964 presidential campaign, psychiatrists publicly spoke about the mental state of then-candidate Barry Goldwater in Fact magazine's September-October 1964 edition. The magazine also asked 12,356 psychiatrists whether Goldwater was “fit to be president,” to which 2,417 psychiatrists responded. Of those who responded, 657 said he was fit, 1,189 said he was not, and 571 said they didn't know enough to answer the question. (Side note: Goldwater later sued the magazine’s editor and owner for libel and won.) 
Prior to the magazine’s publication, the APA had told the publication’s owner, Ralph Ginzburg, that the survey responses were not valid without a “thorough clinical examination” of Goldwater, according to Psychology Today. The magazine went on to publish the survey results and several comments made by licensed psychiatrists. In 1973, the APA added the “Goldwater rule,” also known as Section 7.3, to the APA’s “Principles of Medical Ethics” guide.
Section 7.3 of the APA’s ethics guide states: “On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.”
How is the rule interpreted?
The psychiatric community has differing opinions on the scope of the rule. According to Dr. John Martin-Joy, a narrow view of the rule may be interpreted as prohibiting psychiatrists from providing comments about about public figures to the media without an in-person interview or consent from the subject. A broader interpretation, he says, may mean any comment without an interview or consent would be banned, whether it’s made to the media or otherwise. Such an interpretation could limit the work psychiatrists perform in courtrooms, insurance companies and other institutions. 
Psychiatrists can be asked to evaluate individuals they haven’t personally examined. For example, military leaders may request that a psychiatrist perform a psychological profile on a foreign leader to determine whether that person is a security threat. Psychiatrists may be invited to testify on the mental state of someone convicted of a crime. They may also be called to create profiles on historical figures — in 1931, former APA president A.A. Brill diagnosed Abraham Lincoln as a “manic schizoid personality.” Those who prefer a broader interpretation of the Goldwater rule may object to such psychological profiles.
While the APA has had internal debates over the rule’s interpretation, Dr. Martin-Joy notes that the APA typically uses the narrower reading. In 2008, APA member Jerrold Post received an ethics complaint after the New York Times reported on a presentation he had made to a U.S. House of Representatives committee about former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Post requested that the APA’s ethics committee review the complaint. He asked them whether “psychologically informed leadership studies based on careful research that do not specify a clinical diagnosis and are designed to enhance public and governmental understanding” violated the Goldwater rule. 
The APA determined that Post had not violated its ethics rule, and confirmed that “psychological profiling” that doesn’t include a clinical diagnosis and is the product of “scholarly research that has been subject to peer review and academic scrutiny, and is based on relevant standards of scholarship” does not violate the rule.
Why does it matter?
According to the APA, a psychiatric diagnosis requires an evaluation “based on thorough history taking, examination, and, where applicable, collateral information.” So rendering an opinion without such an evaluation is counter to the measures outlined by the profession. However, the APA allows for certain diagnoses that may not have been reached using established medical practices, as long as the evaluation reflects the limitations of the data and methods used. 
According to the APA, “any evaluation conducted or opinion rendered based on methodology that departs from the established practice of an in-person evaluation must clearly identify the methods used and the limitations of those methods, such as the absence of an in-person examination.” 
The APA also notes that violating the Goldwater rule may “stigmatize” those with mental illness: “Patients who see a psychiatrist, especially their own psychiatrist, offering opinions about individuals whom the psychiatrist has not examined may lose confidence in their psychiatrist and/or the profession and may additionally experience stigma related to their own diagnoses.”
The APA’s code of ethics is nonbinding and only pertains to APA members. A practicing psychiatrist may not lose their his medical license over such an ethical breach.
President Trump
In August, Yale University psychiatry professor Dr. Bandy X. Lee sent a letter to members of Congress, saying that Trump’s “severe emotional impediments” posed “a grave threat to international security.” In December, she briefed a dozen House and Senate members about Trump’s mental state, telling CNN afterwards that it was ""‘obvious’ Trump meets the criteria for dangerousness.” She also published the book, “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.”
Dr. Allen Frances, in comparison, has said professionals “shouldn’t be diagnosing [public figures] at a distance.” Frances is a former psychiatry department chairman at Duke University School of Medicine and helped write the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the main tool mental health professions use to make diagnoses.

In a statement last week, The American Psychiatric Association called “for an end to psychiatrists providing professional opinions in the media about public figures whom they have not examined, whether it be on cable news appearances, books, or in social media.” It said that, ""A proper psychiatric evaluation requires more than a review of television appearances, tweets and public comments. Psychiatrists are medical doctors; evaluating mental illness is no less thorough than diagnosing diabetes or heart disease.”
Trump underwent a physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy and the White House physician, said it “went exceptionally well,” according to The New York Times.

22314,2018-01-15,Hawaii sends false missile alert; FCC says error is ‘unacceptable’,"Hawaii’s emergency alert system sent out a false missile warning to the islands’ residents on Saturday morning, followed by a correction message 38 minutes later. On Sunday, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) called the error “unacceptable” and said that steps would be taken to prevent future false alerts.
Hawaii Emergency Management Agency sent the emergency text at 8:07 a.m. on Saturday. It read, “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”
The agency sent a correction message that there is “no missile threat or danger” to Hawaii and it was a “false alarm.” The agency and the governor also posted corrections on Twitter and Facebook. 
 
Richard Rapoza, spokesman for the emergency agency, said the alert was due to human error: “Someone clicked the wrong thing on the computer.”
Gov. David Y. Ige. apologized for the “pain and confusion” that residents might have experienced after the error. 
FCC chairman Ajit Pai said the commission was investigating and had determined the government did not have “reasonable safeguards” in place to prevent false alarms. “Moving forward, we will focus on what steps need to be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening again.”
“False alerts undermine public confidence in the alerting system and thus reduce their effectiveness during real emergencies,” Pai concluded.  
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the issue was a matter for the state, but that the federal government was “going to now get involved with them.” He did not specify how the U.S. government would be involved. Trump also said it was “terrific” that the state of Hawaii “took total responsibility” for the incident.

22312,2018-01-15,IDF confirms Israel destroys 1-mile Hamas tunnel,"The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed on Sunday that it destroyed an almost 1-mile (1.5 km) tunnel from Gaza to Egypt during an airstrike the day before. The tunnel also ran underneath the Kerem Shalom border crossing, which is a main route between Israeli territories and Gaza. 
Reuters reported that residents in Gaza said Israeli jets bombed the southern town of Rafah late on Saturday night. Palestinian sources said that a tunnel was the target of the attack, according to Haaretz. Hamas, an Islamic political group that controls Gaza and has an armed wing, did not immediately respond to the bombing. 
Prior to the Israeli attack on Saturday, the Kerem Shalom border crossing was closed. 
IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus confirmed on Sunday that the tunnel was destroyed and said “necessary coordination” was made with Egypt for the Israeli military operation. 
Conricus said that because the tunnel ran under the border crossing, the IDF concluded the tunnel was designed for “terror” attacks rather than as a smuggling tunnel. Photos provided by the Israeli military showed the tunnel was made with concrete and wider than most tunnels used by Hamas for smuggling, according to CNN. Conricus did not specify how deep underground the tunnel ran or how long Israeli forces had monitored it before the airstrike.
Israel has on ongoing project to construct an underground wall with sensors along the Gaza border, which is approximately 36 miles (60 km). The wall is estimated to cost $1.1 billion and be completed in 2019. Israel said it has destroyed three tunnels since the end of October.

22397,2018-01-16,CVS to include watermark that identifies digitally-altered images,"On Monday, U.S. health care and retail company CVS announced it will include a “Beauty Mark” watermark in its imagery, indicating an image has not been digitally altered. In a company statement, CVS defines “digitally altered” as ""changing or enhancing a person's shape, size, proportion, skin or eye color, wrinkles, or any other individual characteristics."" 
CVS’ statement adds that it will begin implementing the watermark in 2018, with a goal of full implementation across all its imagery by the end of 2020. CVS has 7,900 stand-alone stores in the U.S., and 80 percent of its 5 million walk-through customers are women, according to The New York Times.
Regarding the decision, CVS Pharmacy President and Health Executive Vice President Helena Foulkes said, “we have a responsibility to think about the messages we send to the customers we reach each day."" She added, “The connection between the propagation of unrealistic body images and negative health effects, especially in girls and young women, has been established. As a purpose-led company, we strive to do our best to assure all of the messages we are sending to our customers reflect our purpose of helping people on their path to better health.”
Foulkes also said CVS will ask other companies in the beauty and cosmetics industry to discuss the matter. CVS reportedly asked brands it sells, such as L’Oréal and Maybelline, to add a similar label to their advertisements.
The “Beauty Mark” watermark is to appear on images in CVS’ marketing materials distributed via the company’s stores, its website and social media.
Brands like Aerie, Asos, Dove, Missguided and Target have reportedly taken similar initiatives.

22389,2018-01-16,Romania’s PM resigns after losing support from his party,"Romanian Prime Minister Mihai Tudose resigned on Monday after his political party withdrew its support. Tudose said he was resigning ""with his head high,"" according to BBC.
Social Democratic Party (SDP) speaker Liviu Dragnea said 60 lawmakers voted against Tudose, four supported him and four others abstained. Development Minister Paul Stanescu will serve as interim prime minister, SDP officials said. 
According to The Washington Post, Romania’s president must now propose a new candidate for prime minister, and the parliament will vote on the candidate. 
Tudose, 50, assumed the role of prime minister in Romania in June 2017, when he replaced Sorin Grindeanu, who vacated the position after a vote of no-confidence from SDP.
Last week, Tudose reportedly accused Interior Minister Carmen Dan of publicly lying to him about having found a replacement for the police department head, according to Romania Insider. Tudose reportedly called on Dan to resign, which she refused to do. Dan is reportedly a “close ally” of Dragnea, The Washington Post reported. 
Before serving as SDP’s parliament speaker, Dragnea served as a cabinet minister. He was convicted in 2015 on ballot-rigging charges in a 2012 referendum. 
On Monday, Tudose said: ""I did not want to break the party."" He added, ""They named me, they removed me. I take responsibility for my deeds and I do not regret anything in my actions.""

22332,2018-01-16,Trump reportedly uses vulgarity when referencing African nations during immigration meeting,"On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly used vulgar language during a meeting with lawmakers, in which Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) presented proposed legislation on immigration. After discussing possible immigration from Haiti and African nations, anonymous sources said Trump asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” On Friday, Trump tweeted that his words at the meeting were “tough, but this was not the language used.” 
The Washington Post, which broke the story, said Trump was told the proposal would benefit Haitians, to which he reportedly responded, “Why do we need more Haitians? Take them out.” Trump also tweeted Friday that he “never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said ‘take them out.’”
MSNBC reported that Durbin said of the president’s tweet that denied the language used, “It is not true. He said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly."" Graham said he told Trump at the time how he felt about his comments. Reps. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Robert W. Goodlatte (R.-Va.), and Sens. David Perdue (R.-Ga.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also attended the meeting. Cotton and Perdue said they could not recall “specifically” the language Trump had used.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah issued a statement Thursday that did not address or deny Trump’s comments. He said, “Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.” 
Among other items detailed below, the bipartisan proposal included the legal status revision of about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as children, so-called “Dreamers.” In September, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that granted work authorizations and deferred deportation for “dreamers” was “being rescinded,” with no new work permits to be issued after Mar. 5, 2018. 
DACA was established by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in June 2012, during the Obama administration. After the announcement of an end to DACA, Trump said it was “now time for Congress to act” on the issue.
A judge in California ruled last week that DACA would continue past the March deadline while litigation continued against the Trump administration’s decision to rescind the program. The ruling requires DHS to process work permit renewals, but it does not require the department to accept new applicants.
Trump reportedly said at the Thursday meeting that he would be receptive to proposals that allow more immigrants from Asian countries because he thinks they would benefit the U.S. economy. Trump also reportedly said the U.S. should admit more people from countries such as Norway. The president had met with Norway’s prime minister the day before.
About the bipartisan proposal
Thursday’s proposal included over $2.5 billion for “border security” and protected status for parents of DACA recipients, who would not be allowed to sponsor their parents for U.S. citizenship, The New York Times reported. The plan also reportedly included stopping the current version of the diversity visa lottery program that issues approximately 50,000 visas per year and allocating about half of those visas to immigrants with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The proposal also included reinstating TPS protections for some countries that have been removed from the program, such as last week’s removal of El Salvador, and $1.5 billion to fund a border wall, according to The Washington Post. 
The White House had released remarks from a Tuesday meeting in which Trump mentioned three “vital goals” for any DACA legislation: 1) a border wall and measures to “close enforcement loopholes,” 2) ending so-called “chain migration” and 3) ending the visa lottery program. On Tuesday of last week, Trump tweeted that a border wall with Mexico, one of his campaign promises, “must be part of any DACA approval.”

22487,2018-01-17,Bannon subpoenaed to testify before grand jury in Russia investigation,"According to media reports, former White House advisor Stephen K. Bannon was subpoenaed by special counsel Robert Mueller last week to testify before a grand jury. Mueller’s team is investigating whether or not any members of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump’s team cooperated with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
On Tuesday, Bannon appeared separately before the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. The committee’s proceedings were not open to the public.
Bannon was the chief executive of Trump’s election campaign. After Trump took office, Bannon became White House chief strategist. He left his position in August last year.

22485,2018-01-17,US Justice Department to appeal DACA ruling,"The U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday it plans to appeal a federal court ruling preventing the Trump administration from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and said it plans to file a petition with the Supreme Court later this week, asking for a direct review of the ruling.
Last week, San Francisco-based Federal District Judge William Alsup ruled that lawsuits from California and other states were “likely to succeed on the merits of their claim” that the Trump administration’s efforts to end DACA were “arbitrary and capricious.” The ruling stated the administration must continue accepting DACA renewals nationwide, but it does not need to receive or process new applications. On Saturday, the administration resumed accepting renewal requests, citing Alsup’s ruling.
In the Justice Department’s press release, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ""It defies both law and common sense for DACA … to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in San Francisco”
The DACA program protects immigrants who illegally entered the U.S. as children from deportation. DACA was established in 2012 during the Obama administration, and has around 700,000 participants. In September last year, President Donald Trump announced an end to the program starting in March 2018.

North Korea likely to have launched missile. The government J alert: evacuate inside the building or underground."" The warning was also published on NHK’s website. The alert was sent just before 7 pm and was retracted less than 10 minutes later.
NHK later apologized for the mistake, saying it was caused by a “switching error.” National Public Radio reported that no further details on the cause were provided by NHK and a spokesperson said the broadcaster was still investigating.
NHK also clarified that the government had not issued a J-alert, Japan’s national warning system, and that there were no reports of problems due to the error.
The alert came three days after Hawaii sent out a similar false alarm. That warning was also later retracted.

22490,2018-01-17,Kosovo Serb politician Oliver Ivanović shot and killed,"On Tuesday morning, Kosovo Serb politician Oliver Ivanović was shot and killed outside his office in Mitrovica, Kosovo. Serbian TV broadcaster RTS reported that Ivanović was shot at least five times. CNN said he was transferred to a hospital where he was declared dead at 9:15 am local time. Ivanović, 64, was the leader of the Freedom, Democracy, Justice Party and was scheduled to attend talks in Brussels between Kosovo and Serbian delegates starting on Tuesday. The talks were to discuss relations between Kosovo and Serbia.
After the news of Ivanović’s death, the Serbian delegation left Brussels to return home, according to the Serbian government.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 after a 10-year violent conflict between Serb and Kosovo Albanian forces. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo’s population. More than 100 countries recognize Kosovo as an independent country, including the U.S, U.K. and Germany. Serbia, Russia and some EU countries do not recognize Kosovo’s independence and Kosovo is not a member of the United Nations.
In 2016, a panel of international judges convicted Ivanović of war crimes for his actions during the Kosovo war. Last year, his conviction was overturned and sent back for a retrial. Ivanović had pleaded not guilty.

22553,2018-01-18,Breaking down DACA,"The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) recently announced plans to appeal a federal court ruling preventing the Trump administration from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). The DOJ also said it plans to file a petition with the Supreme Court for a direct review of the ruling.
For those wondering what DACA is and why it’s being litigated, we’ve compiled a rundown below.
What is DACA?
DACA is a policy that outlines how U.S. authorities should treat the immigration status of people who were illegally brought into the country as minors. It started in 2012 when then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issued a letter to immigration and customs officials advising them as to how to handle “certain young people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home.” Napolitano noted that, since the children were minors when they entered the U.S., they “lacked the intent to violate” immigration law.
Under the direction of Homeland Security, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began accepting requests for “consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals.” USCIS noted that it would consider requests on a case-by-case basis, and applicants had to meet the following criteria:

	Entered the United States before reaching their 16th birthday.
	Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time.
	Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012.
	Entered the country without inspection before June 15, 2012, or had no lawful immigration status as of June 15, 2012.
	Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general educational development certification, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States.
	Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat.
	Were present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making a request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS.

Applicants who meet the criteria could receive two-year renewable work permits. Under DACA, they can also obtain driver’s licenses, enroll in college and and receive scholarships, join the U.S. military, legally work and pay taxes.
How many people does DACA affect?
According to USCIS figures from Sept. 4, 2017, about 690,000 unauthorized immigrants are currently enrolled in the DACA program. About 66 percent of enrollees are 25 years old or younger. DACA has granted work permits and other benefits to approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants since 2012.
The DACA program may also affect U.S. tax revenue. A 2016 study by Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that undocumented immigrants, including those who qualify for DACA, collectively pay an estimated $11.64 billion a year in state and local taxes.
How does DACA relate to the DREAM Act?
DACA was enacted in 2012 after Congress did not pass the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAM Act) for a seventh time the year before. The DREAM Act would have allowed certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to apply for temporary legal status and eventually obtain permanent legal status or U.S. citizenship if they first go to college or serve in the U.S. military. 
While DACA allows eligible immigrant children to work, attend college and join the military, it doesn’t provide a path to citizenship. Former President Obama described DACA as a “temporary stopgap measure” intended to give Congress time to pass the DREAM Act.
The DREAM Act has been introduced in the Senate at least seven times since 2001. It was first introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah); he introduced it again in 2003. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced his version at least four times: once in 2005, and again in 2007, 2010 and 2011. And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a version in July 2017. None of the bills have made it past the “introduced” stage, which means they were never voted on by the full Senate or House of Representatives.
Can DACA recipients apply for citizenship?
According to Immigration lawyer Hadley Bajramovic, since DACA is not an immigrant visa, recipients can’t automatically gain a Legal Permanent Residency (LPR) / Green Card. Undocumented immigrants living in the United States are not eligible to apply for an immigrant visa “without the penalty of being barred from the United States for 3 to 10 years.” 
Immigrants typically have to apply for a visa prior to entering the U.S. or after entering the U.S. legally, which is something DACA recipients may not have been able to do if they entered illegally as children. However, DACA recipients may request that a “qualified” relative living in the U.S. petition for them to obtain a visa, or marry a U.S. citizen.
How did we get here?
Here is a brief timeline of DACA-related events:
May 11, 2011: Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) introduces the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAM Act) for a fourth time. As with previous attempts, the Act doesn’t move past the introductory stage of legislation.
June 15, 2012: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issues a letter to immigration and customs officials outlining the policy later known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
June 29, 2017: A group of Republican state officials from 10 states request that the Trump Administration rescind DACA by Sept. 5 in exchange for dropping a lawsuit currently pending against the government.
Sept. 5, 2017: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces that the DACA program is being rescinded. Sessions said the Trump administration will stop considering new applications for legal status. Any DACA recipients with a permit set to expire before March 5, 2018 can apply for a two-year renewal if they renew by Oct. 5, 2017.
Sept. 6, 2017: A group of 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia file a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its decision to end DACA.
Sept. 11, 2017: The state of California files a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its decision to rescind DACA.
Jan. 9, 2018: San Francisco-based Federal District Judge William Alsup rules that the Trump administration must continue accepting DACA renewals nationwide, but it does not need to receive or process new applications.

22535,2018-01-18,"Sens. Flake, McCain criticize Trump’s comments about the media","In a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) criticized President Donald Trump’s comments about U.S. media. Last year, Trump said the press is the “enemy of the people.” Flake said the president uses “words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies.” 
He gave the speech on the day Trump had said he would give “Fake News Awards” to “the most corrupt  biased of the Mainstream Media.” Trump wrote about the “awards” in a tweet on Wednesday night. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) also criticized Trump’s treatment of the media.
In his speech, Flake said 2017 was a year in which “truth” was “more battered and abused than at any time in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government.” He said, “The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy.” Flake added that, “when a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him ‘fake news,’ it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.” 
In a press briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the White House take questions and “welcome access to the media every day.”
Sanders called Flake a “mouthpiece for the oppressive Cuban government,” saying “he’s not criticizing the president because he’s against oppression, he’s criticizing the president because he has terrible poll numbers and he is looking for some attention.” She said the senator was “recently defending an actually oppressive regime,” referencing his recent trip to Cuba. Flake visited Cuba last week to get briefed on the unexplained health issues affecting U.S. diplomats and their families. He said there was no FBI evidence that Cubans attacked the diplomats and said Cubans “bristle at the word ‘attack.’"" He said he thought Cubans were ""justified” since no evidence of an attack has been produced.
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also tweeted about Flake’s speech, saying “turn on the news. It’s wall-to-wall biased coverage against @POTUS.” She added, “Comparing the leader of the free world to murderous dictators is absurd. You’ve gone too far.”
In McCain’s op-ed, he said “the phrase ‘fake news’ – granted legitimacy by an American president – is being used by autocrats to silence reporters, undermine political opponents, stave off media scrutiny and mislead citizens.” He also said, “Congress must commit to protecting independent journalism, preserving an open and free media environment, and defending the fundamental right to freedom of opinion and expression.” He said Trump’s criticism of the press is “being closely watched by foreign leaders who are already using his words as cover as they silence and shutter one of the key pillars of democracy.”

22539,2018-01-18,White House physician: Trump in ‘excellent’ health,"In a White House press briefing on Tuesday, the White House physician said President Donald Trump’s “overall health is excellent,” adding that he has “absolutely no concerns about the president’s cognitive ability or his neurological function.” 
Dr. Ronny Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy, conducted a medical examination of Trump on Friday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In the hour-long press briefing, Jackson answered questions from reporters and said he thought the president would “remain fit for duty for the remainder of his term.”
Jackson gave reporters information about the tests he conducted, including a cardiac exam and a cognitive assessment. He said the president asked him to conduct a cognitive exam, and the result was a 30 out of 30 score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test. The doctor recommended a diet and exercise plan for the president, recommending he “lose 10 or 15 pounds” over the next year.

22541,2018-01-18,"Former CIA officer arrested, charged with retaining classified information","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday that a former CIA officer was arrested on charges of illegal retention of classified national defense information. Jerry Chung Shing Lee, also known as Zen Cheng Li, was arrested on Monday at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. A court affidavit said Lee was searched in 2012 and found to have top-secret information that, if revealed, “could cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.” Lee appeared in court in the Eastern District of New York on Tuesday.
Lee, a naturalized U.S. citizen, currently resides in Hong Kong, China. According to court documents, Lee had top secret clearance while working at the CIA between 1994 and 2007. The affidavit said that when searched, Lee had notebooks with information pertaining to operational meetings and locations, such as phone numbers, true names of assets and covert facilities. According to the New York Times, that information was used to reveal U.S. spy operations in China, exposing more than a dozen CIA informants.
A federal district court judge will rule on Lee’s case and, if convicted, he could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

22659,2018-01-19,US House passes short-term spending bill before Friday deadline; bill moves to Senate,"The U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term spending bill on Thursday night that, if approved by the Senate and signed into law, would fund the government until Feb. 16. If the bill is not signed by the president before midnight on Friday, a government shutdown is scheduled to go into effect. 
The joint resolution passed the House 230-197. Sixty votes are needed for approval in the Senate. Republicans hold 51 seats in the Senate, but Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is not in Congress due to ill health. With his absence, Republicans would need all Republicans and at least 10 Democrats to vote in favor of the measure for it to pass. Three Republican senators have said they would vote against the bill: Mike Rounds (S.D.), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.).
Other measures were attached to the spending bill that the House approved. It included the repeal of some Affordable Care Act taxes, as well as a six-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The program provides services to about 9 million children from “low-income” families. 
Some Democrats had also requested that a congressional replacement for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program be included in the bill; it wasn’t. 
The government has passed three other short-term spending bills since September of last year, two of them in December.
What happens in a government shutdown?
If the government were to shutdown, some “nonessential” government departments would close and employees would be placed on furlough, which means they would not come to work or be paid. Visa and passport processing could be delayed. 
Services deemed “essential” would continue. These could include food inspections, air traffic control, national security, disaster assistance, prison operations, taxation, electricity production and Social Security. The U.S. Postal Service would continue to deliver mail, according to CNN. 
Military services would still operate, though, The Washington Post reported, service members would not be paid unless Congress passed a special measure for them.
During past shutdowns, national parks and monuments have closed at least partially. U.S. Department of the Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said that if a shutdown occurs, the department would allow “limited access wherever possible” to national parks, adding that war memorials and open-air parks in Washington, D.C., would remain open to the public.
The last government shutdown occurred in 2013 and lasted for 16 days. The Washington Post reports that about 800,000 government workers were furloughed at the time. That shutdown occurred as Republicans lobbied for changes to the Affordable Care Act, which were not granted.

22656,2018-01-19,"NASA says 2015 to 2017 were the three warmest years on record, attributes to ‘human-made’ emissions","The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reported on Thursday that 2017 was the second hottest year since 1880, the earliest year NASA uses to compare global temperature records. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), using different methodologies, determined 2017 was the third hottest year, after 2016 and 2015. NASA said that the temperature has risen about 2 degree Fahrenheit (1.1 degree Celsius) over the past century.
NASA estimated 2017 would have been the hottest year on record were it not for the El Niño warming event that occurred during the majority of 2015 and the first third of 2016, and the La Niña cooling event starting in the second half of 2017. El Niño and La Niña periods are part of the natural variations in the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean; El Niño times coincide with an increase in temperatures, and La Niña a decrease in temperatures.
Both NASA’s and NOAA’s analyses show that the five warmest years on record have occurred since 2010. Petteri Taalas, Secretary General of the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organizations, said that 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have come this century.
NASA attributed the increase in average temperature since the end of the 1800s as “largely” due to increased carbon dioxide and “other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.” 
The Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting average temperatures to no more than a 2.7 degree Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) increase since “pre-industrial” levels.
Data collection
NASA says its analysis uses “surface temperature measurements” from 6,300 locations around the world on land and sea. NASA notes that temperature recording locations and measurement techniques have changed with time. This variation introduces some uncertainty, and can be partially accounted for in models. Given that, NASA estimates accuracy to within 0.1 degree Fahrenheit with a 95 percent certainty level. NOAA's data collection methods differ, which accounts for the discrepancies between its findings and NASA's findings for the year 2017.

22652,2018-01-19,US health department to support healthcare workers who decline giving care for religious reasons,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on Thursday it would create a Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in its Office for Civil Rights (OCR). HHS said the new division would restore enforcement of U.S. laws that protect the rights of “conscience and religious freedom” for healthcare workers. This could include ensuring hospitals do not discriminate against doctors who, on religious grounds, choose to not provide post-abortion care.
According to the HHS website’s “conscience protections” section, healthcare workers are protected against discrimination if they object to participating in euthanasia, abortions and sterilizations, including in training and research.
Under the Obama administration, health care workers were barred from refusing to perform services for transgender individuals, or for people who were seeking abortions or had undergone them. 
OCR Director Roger Severino said, “no one should be forced to choose between helping sick people” and one’s “moral or religious convictions.” He said the new division would “help guarantee that victims of unlawful discrimination find justice.”
The HHS website says the OCR receives discrimination complaints under the following laws: The Church Amendments, Section 245 of the Public Health Service Act, The Weldon Amendment and The Affordable Care Act.
In October, HHS announced that employers would be allowed to stop paying for birth control coverage as part of employer-provided health care plans.

22649,2018-01-19,"Hospital groups to form generic drug company to address rising prices, shortages","On Thursday, Intermountain Healthcare announced that it and other groups would form a not-for-profit pharmaceutical company to produce generic drugs. Three other hospital groups and the U.S. Veterans Health Association (VA) would join the company. A statement from Intermountain said the goal of the new company would be to address shortages and the “high costs” of generic medications. 
Intermountain CEO Dr. Marc Harrison said the new company would produce a limited range of drugs. Intermountain, a non-profit, did not specify which drugs the new company would manufacture.
The New York Times reported that hospitals have experienced shortages of “hundreds” of drugs over the past decade, including injectable morphine and medical sodium bicarbonate. The Times cited examples of increasing drug prices; for instance, the cost of antibiotic doxycycline hyclate increased from 5.6 cents per pill in 2012 to $3.65 per pill in 2013.
Besides Intermountain and the VA, the three hospital groups involved are Ascension, Trinity Health and SSM Health. The five groups combined operate more than 450 hospitals across the country, making up about ten percent of U.S. hospitals. 
The new company may apply for Food and Drug Administration approval to make drugs themselves, or contract production to a third party. Former Sen. Bob Kerrey, who is a pharmacist, and former director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Don Berwick, will be on the advisory board of the new company.

Fourteen of the 18 victims were foreign nationals. Eleven of the 14 foreigners were employees of KamAir, a private Afghani airline, according to the Interior Ministry. Four gunmen were killed by security forces. The Associated Press reported that the number of fatalities may increase. Ten people, including six security officers, were injured. The Interior Ministry said 153 people were safely evacuated from the hotel.
Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry spokesperson Najib Danish said the attackers entered the hotel through the kitchen at 9 p.m. local time Saturday night. He said initial investigations indicated someone inside had helped them gain access, adding that the investigations were still ongoing. 
The Interior Ministry also stated that the Haqqani network was responsible for the attack. According to CNN, this group seeks to re-establish Taliban rule in Afghanistan.
Both foreigners and Afghani officials reportedly stay at the Intercontinental hotel. The hotel has been attacked before; a 2011 incident killed 18 people, including all seven assailants. That attack was also claimed by the Taliban.

Turkish news outlet Anadolu Agency reported that the troops, supported by armored vehicles and Special Forces, have moved 3 miles (approximately 5 km) inside Syria. 
The YPG has had control of Afrin since 2012, when Syrian government troops vacated the area. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group with ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). PKK has fought against the Turkish government since 1984. The U.S. has previously supported the YPG with arms as a part of its fight against Islamic State in Syria.
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the aim of the operation against YPG was to establish a 18.6-mile (30 km) “safe zone.” Anadolu reported that the Turkish cities of Kilis and Hatay are within firing range of the Afrin side of the border. 
As part of the campaign, named Operation Olive Branch, Turkish air force and artillery have hit 153 targets in Afrin province since Saturday afternoon, according to Turkey’s general staff. 
The government campaign is supported by 25,000 fighters from the Free Syrian Army group (FSA). FSA Commander Major Yasser Abdul Rahim said the operation would not target civilians nor include fighting in the city of Afrin. The YPG said some of strikes had hit civilian targets.

22810,2018-01-22,"US Vice President Mike Pence visits Israel, Jordan and Egypt","U.S. Vice President Mike Pence arrived in Israel Sunday, as part of a three part state visit that included trips to Jordan and Egypt. Pence, who arrived in Tel Aviv on Sunday afternoon, is scheduled to address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, on Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would speak with Pence about Iran’s nuclear program and about advancing “peace and security in the region.” Pence will not be meeting with any Palestinian leaders, according to PLO’s Executive Committee. 
Last month, the Trump administration announced a decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Israel’s government is seated in West Jerusalem; the Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a speech earlier this month that the U.S. could no longer serve as a mediator in negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. 
Prior to Pence’s visit, the Palestinian Authority said the vice president would not be invited to its headquarters in the West Bank.
In Jordan, Pence visited U.S. troops on the Syrian border. He also met with Jordan’s King Abdullah, after which he told reporters that they’d had a “very frank discussion.” Pence said to reporters, “friends occasionally have disagreements and we agreed to disagree” on the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. “What we agreed on was the need for all parties to come back to the table,” Pence added. 
King Abdullah described Pence’s visit as a mission to “rebuild trust and confidence” in the two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
On Saturday, Pence met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi while in Cairo. Pence reportedly asked el-Sissi and King Abdullah to contact the Palestinians on the U.S.’ behalf to ask them to restart peace talks with Israel, according to unnamed sources cited by Bloomberg.

22813,2018-01-22,US government ‘shutdown’ continues into third day,"A partial shutdown of U.S. government services continues into a third day on Monday, after the deadline passed for the Senate to approve a short-term spending bill on Friday night. The Senate vote on Friday’s bill was 50 – 49; it needed at least 60 votes in favor to pass.
Congress spent Saturday and Sunday negotiating a new spending bill. Senate leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that a vote was scheduled for noon on Monday on a bill to fund the government for three more weeks, moving it from an originally scheduled vote at 1 a.m. Monday morning.
As part of the negotiations on the spending bill, Senate Democrats are seeking to extend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. They have also asked for increased funding for disaster relief and opioid treatment programs.
What happens in a government shutdown?
During a government shutdown, some “nonessential” governmental departments are closed and employees are placed on furlough. This means they will not go to work this Monday or receive a paycheck, unless Congress reaches an agreement before then.
Services deemed “essential” continue. These include food inspections, air traffic control, national security, disaster assistance, prison operations, taxation, electricity production and Social Security. The U.S. Postal Service still continues to deliver mail, according to CNN.
Military services still operate, The Washington Post reported, though service members are not paid unless Congress passes a special measure for them.
During past shutdowns, national parks and monuments have closed at least partially. On Sunday, sites such as Philadelphia’s Liberty Bell were closed, while other sites such as Yellowstone National Park were open.
About 800,000 government workers were furloughed during the last shutdown in 2013, which occurred as Republicans unsuccessfully lobbied for changes to the Affordable Care Act.

22788,2018-01-22,"Hundreds of thousands demonstrate at Women’s March events in US, abroad","Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday in cities across the U.S. and abroad, as part of protests organized by the group Women’s March. Millions of people reportedly demonstrated worldwide in last year’s Women’s March, the day after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated. Some of the issues cited in this year’s protests were Trump’s policies, immigration and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, LGBTQ rights, abortion and sexual harassment.
On its website, Women’s March includes the following “unity principles”: ending violence against women, environmental justice, workers’ rights including equal pay for women, and civil, disability, reproductive, LGBTQ and immigrant rights. The group’s stated mission is to “harness the political power of diverse women and their communities to create transformative social change.” Also, “Women’s March is committed to dismantling systems of oppression through nonviolent resistance and building inclusive structures guided by self-determination, dignity and respect.”
An adviser for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio estimated that more than 120,000 people marched in the city on Saturday, gathering in Central Park West. Thousands more demonstrated in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington and other U.S. cities. People demonstrated or planned to demonstrate in other countries as well, including Canada, China, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Iraq, Italy, Japan and Nigeria.
The Women’s March group also planned demonstrations for Sunday. CNN reported that “thousands” of people gathered in different cities across the U.S. and in other parts of the world on Sunday. The largest of the U.S. rallies, “Power to the Polls,” took place in Las Vegas, initiating a national campaign to increase voter registration. University of Nevada-Las Vegas police estimated attendance at around 8,000, azcentral.com reported.
Some legislators spoke at Saturday’s demonstration in Washington. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke about women who marched last year, “and now they have run for office, and some of them have already won their office.” She added, “We want women to know their power … by showing up not only on the day of the march, but … in town halls.”
According to NPR correspondent Leila Fadel, “One of the big criticisms” of last year’s march in Washington was that protesters were “mostly white, liberal women.” She said this year, organizers were trying “to access a cross section of America, from minorities to the disenfranchised to women in low-income communities.""
Trump tweeted on Saturday, ""Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!"" The unemployment rate for women over the age of 20 has decreased since 2012, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
On Friday, Trump spoke in Washington at the March for Life, an anti-abortion demonstration. He told protesters, “We are with you all the way.”

22889,2018-01-23,"Voting in the US Senate: What’s a filibuster or the ‘nuclear option,’ anyway?","Filibusters, cloture votes, the “nuclear option;” people reading about the latest budget bill in the U.S. Senate may have come across these terms and wondered what they mean. In general, they’re specific to how the Senate votes on a bill. We break down each term and process below.
First let’s start with a bill itself:
How a bill becomes law in the Senate

	A bill is drafted (it can be drafted by lawmakers, scholars, the White House or even constituents).
	If it goes to the Senate first (as opposed to the House of Representatives), a senator introduces it in the Senate chamber.
	If no senators object, the bill is read twice and referred to a particular committee, such as the appropriations committee, for review.
	The bill is entered into the Senate journal and given a number.
	Once entered into the legislative system, it is printed for Senate, House and committee members.
	The bill is then placed on the legislative calendar.
	The Senate majority leader requests “unanimous consent” to present the bill before the Senate.
	If consent is granted, the senators debate the bill; they may also submit or propose amendments.
	After a third reading of the bill, it is brought to the Senate chamber for a vote.
	If the bill passes there, a final copy is prepared and delivered to the House of Representatives for a vote.
	The House may vote on the bill as is or amend it. If it is amended and passes, it must return to the Senate for another vote.
	If passed in the House as is, the bill is sent to the White House for the president’s signature.
	Once the president signs a bill that both chambers approved, it becomes law.

Voting in the Senate
A bill typically requires a simple majority to pass, though senators may seek 60 votes to avoid a filibuster (explained in the next section). In the case of a tie, the vice president casts the tie breaking vote.
There are three methods of voting used in the Senate: roll-call, voice or division.

Roll call vote: Each senator votes ""Yes"" or ""No"" (or “yea” and “nay”) as the chamber clerk calls his or her name, and records the votes on a tally sheet. A roll call vote must be taken if requested by at least one-fifth of senators (20).
Voice vote: The presiding officer in the Senate states the question or motion, and then asks for those in favor to say “yea” and those against to say “no.” The officer uses his or her “best judgement” to determine the ruling and then announces the results. In a voice vote, senators’ names and the exact number of votes are not recorded.
Division vote: If a senator disagrees with the presiding officer’s “best judgement” when declaring a voice vote, he or she may request that the presiding officer count the “yea’s” and “no’s” to confirm the voice vote.

The filibuster
According to the U.S. Senate, the term “filibuster” comes from a Dutch word meaning “pirate.” Senators usually have the right to speak on the Senate floor for as long as he or she wants, as long as no other senator is speaking. “Filibustering” is when a senator prevents voting on a bill by holding the Senate floor and continuing to speak. Filibustering is not allowed during House votes.
In 1917, the Senate adopted a rule that allowed it to end a filibuster with a two-thirds majority of 67 votes, also called a “cloture” vote. In 1975, the Senate lowered the number needed for a cloture vote to 60. For example, if the Senate majority leader wanted a bill to pass, and he or she knew that senators who opposed the bill planned to filibuster, the majority leader may seek 60 senators to vote to end the debate process, which ends a filibuster. (For Hollywood’s take on the filibuster, watch Jimmy Stewart’s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.)
Reconciliation
The Senate can bypass a filibuster and vote via a “simple majority” (51 votes) if the bill meets “reconciliation” rules created by the Congressional Budget Act. Reconciliation pertains to legislation that affects mandatory spending programs or taxes. It was recently used to pass the tax bill.
The ‘nuclear option’
The “nuclear option” is a term supposedly coined by The Washington Times after an interview with former Republican Sen. Trent Lott. It refers to the process of changing Senate rules and eliminating the filibuster so that legislation can pass with a simple majority. 
The Senate has used the “nuclear option,” or changed rules, to confirm nominees to judicial posts. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer changed Senate confirmation rules for posts in lower courts to help confirm President Obama’s judicial nominees. Last year, current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell changed Senate confirmation rules for the U.S. Supreme Court to confirm Neil Gorsuch.
Once the Senate rules are changed, they’re changed; it sets a precedent for the required number of votes on a topic. Changing the rules for legislative votes can limit the minority party’s ability to object to bills, so a majority party may not want to change the rules because it would set a precedent that might affect the party when it’s a minority in the future, according to USA Today. According to Politifact, the “nuclear option” has not been used to change legislative voting rules.",Context|Law &amp; Justice,USA,,Congress|Senate,Washington,,world_news,publish
22904,2018-01-23,"Facebook releases new ‘Hard Questions’ blog series discussing social media, democracy","On Monday, Facebook released a new blog post series discussing social media and its purported effects on democracy. The new “Hard Questions” series included three new posts featuring two Facebook executives and a Harvard Law School professor. 
Facebook's head of civic engagement, Samidh Chakrabarti, said in his post that ""Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family — and it has excelled at that. But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it's being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.""
Chakrabarti also said social media “amplifies human intent — both good and bad,” and that in 2016 Facebook was “far too slow to recognize how bad actors were abusing our platform.” He added that the social network is working to “neutralize” potential risks, and that it has implemented a fact-checking process on news posted on the platform, as well as new transparency rules for political advertising, among other initiatives. 
In her post, Facebook Global Politics and Government Outreach Director Katie Harbath said, ""From the Arab Spring to robust elections around the globe, social media seemed like a positive. The last US presidential campaign changed that, with foreign interference that Facebook should have been quicker to identify to the rise of 'fake news' and echo chambers.""
Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein wrote, “The uses of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others depends on a variety of factors, including individual choices, relevant algorithms, social norms, and the architectural judgments of the platform designers themselves.”
As part of the new series, Facebook will reportedly invite other experts to discuss the matter, including social media scholar and former president of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves and University of Sydney professor Ariadne Vromen.
The “Hard Questions” series has included posts about hate speech, children’s use of online platforms, the benefits and disadvantages of spending time on social media networks, and safety considerations regarding face recognition technology, among others.

22907,2018-01-23,Former soccer player George Weah sworn in as Liberian president,"On Monday, former Liberian soccer player George Weah was sworn in as the country’s 25th president.
“My pledge to you today is that my administration, with your help, will make steady and deliberate progress towards achieving [Liberians’] hopes and aspirations,” he said in his first address to the nation. The Guardian described the inauguration as the country’s “first peaceful, democratic transition of power in 47 years.”
Weah also said he would address corruption in the country during his term: “It is my belief that the most effective way to directly impact the poor, and to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor is to make sure that public resources do not end up in the pockets of government officials.”
Weah, 51, first ran for president in 2005, and lost to former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who served from 2006 to 2018. Sirleaf became the first elected female head of state in Africa, as well as a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Weah began his soccer career in 1987 and retired in 2002. As an international professional athlete, Weah played for the Milan, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain soccer teams. In 1995, he was named FIFA’s World Player of the Year.
In 2003, Weah returned to Liberia as a U.N. goodwill ambassador.

22909,2018-01-23,TSA orders additional screening of US-bound cargo flights from 5 Middle Eastern countries,"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued an emergency order on Monday requiring additional screening of U.S.-bound cargo on flights departing from five Middle East countries: Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The new regulation is part of the 2010 Air Cargo Advance Screening program, and may affect an estimated 250 flights per week, NBC News reported.
In its statement, the U.S. agency said it included these countries because of “demonstrated intent by terrorist groups to attack aviation from them.” A TSA spokesperson added that there is no “current specific threat to U.S.-bound cargo.”
Under the order, airlines must now provide U.S.-bound shipment information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection prior to loading and departure, including cargo, sender and recipient information. The TSA is then to compare shipment information against government data on terror threats. 
The TSA’s statement also noted that most of the order’s requirements are already being carried out voluntarily by airlines in some countries. The statement did not elaborate on which countries are in compliance.

22911,2018-01-23,"Trump approves tariffs on solar energy, washing machines","On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump approved tariffs on imported solar panel components and washing machines. The decision followed a recommendation from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC).
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer issued a statement saying that “Injury to U.S. washing machine manufacturers stems from a sharp increase in imports that began in 2012. The ITC found that imports of large residential washers increased ‘steadily’ from 2012 to 2016, and that domestic producers’ financial performance ‘declined precipitously.’” 
According to the decision, an immediate tariff of 30 percent will apply to most imported solar modules, with the rate declining 5 percent each year over the next four years. Solar cell imports will be exempt from the tariff, The Associated Press (AP) reported. Regarding washing machines, a 20 percent tariff will be applied to the first 1.2 million units, and a 50 percent tariff to subsequent imports during the next two years.
Suniva Inc. and the U.S. subsidiary of Germany’s SolarWorld reportedly sought the tariffs on solar panels after they claimed imported components over five years led to a decrease in prices.
Solar installers opposed the decision, saying it would raise prices and lower demand. The Solar Energy Industries Association said the decision will lead to “billions of dollars of solar investment [being] delayed or canceled, leading to the loss of 23,000 jobs this year” presumably in the U.S., AP reported.
Whirlpool Corp. supported the tariffs on washing machines, saying they would create manufacturing jobs in the U.S.
A 1974 trade law allows U.S. companies to seek trade protections if they can prove damages from a rise in imports. Countries affected by the decision may appeal to the World Trade Organization, according to AP.

23008,2018-01-24,Sessions questioned by special counsel Mueller’s office,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was questioned last Wednesday as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, The New York Times reported Tuesday. The meeting was confirmed by Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores. CNN reported that Sessions was not under subpoena and that he was the fifteenth person connected with the Trump campaign to be questioned by Mueller’s office. He is also the first cabinet member to be interviewed.
The Times also reported Tuesday that Mueller’s office interviewed former FBI director James Comey last year. Investigators reportedly asked Comey about the memos he wrote describing his interactions with President Donald Trump. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the memos last June.
As Attorney General, Sessions had oversight of an FBI investigation into whether Russia had attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He recused himself from all matters related to this investigation in March 2017. Sessions’ Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein then appointed Mueller as special counsel to carry out the investigation in May last year. The appointment followed President Trump’s dismissal of Comey from his post as FBI director on the recommendation of Sessions and Rosenstein.
Mueller’s investigation was initially focused on Russia’s alleged attempt to interfere in the election. It has since expanded to also investigate whether Trump attempted to obstruct the investigation. Trump told reporters Tuesday that he was “not at all concerned” that a member of his cabinet was questioned.

23011,2018-01-24,Turkey troops take control of areas in northern Syria,"Turkish media reported Tuesday that Turkish government troops had taken control of 11 areas in northwestern Syria, and created “safe zones” on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey. The troops have reportedly taken control of four villages, four hills and three rural areas in Afrin province. The action by the troops is part of a campaign to remove the armed Kurdish YPG group from Afrin province, which started on Saturday.
The Turkish military said one of its soldiers was killed in the border town of Gulbaba. Fifty-four Syrian fighters and 24 civilians have also been killed, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Turkish government said that there have been no civilian casualties. According to a U.N. report released on Tuesday, around 5,000 people have fled their homes in border communities and moved towards more central parts of Afrin province since the campaign began.
Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group with ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). PKK has fought for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The YPG denies any direct links to PKK. The U.S. has previously supported the YPG with arms as part of its fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said the campaign and the resulting fighting “disrupts what was a relatively stable area of Syria” and that it “distracts from the international efforts to ensure the defeat” of IS. BBC previously reported that Ankara had said the U.S. “had to stop backing the YPG if [it] wanted cooperation.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday that the U.S. recognized Turkey’s “legitimate concerns"" for its security, and that the U.S. is willing to work with the country to address said concerns, according to BBC.

23019,2018-01-24,Philippine volcano Mount Mayon erupts,"On Monday afternoon, the Mount Mayon volcano in the Philippines erupted for eight minutes. The eruption sent lava between 1,640 and 2,300 feet up into the air and created a column of ash and volcanic gas between 1.6 and 1.9 miles high, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries.
The Volcanology Institute said two ""explosion-type earthquakes"" and 18 tremors had happened since Monday afternoon. Some of the tremors sent out streams of lava, one of which flowed close to 2 kilometers from the crater. Filipino authorities have raised the volcano alert level to four, out of a maximum of five, and extended the danger zone to 5 miles around the crater. NPR reported that level four indicates ""intense unrest"" and the possibility of a hazardous eruption within days.
More than 56,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and are currently taking shelter in 46 evacuation camps. More than 30,000 ash masks, along with 5,000 sacks of rice, water and medicine are being sent to these shelters, according to the Office of Civil Defense. The Legazpi airport has been shut down by the Civil Aviation Authority due to falling ash.
Mount Mayon, which is located 210 miles southeast of Manila, has erupted around 50 times in the last 500 years. In 1814, more than 1,200 people were buried by volcanic mud. In 2013, five climbers were killed by an ash eruption.

23148,2018-01-25,USA Gymnastics doctor sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexual misconduct,"A judge in Michigan sentenced former U.S.A. Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday for sexual misconduct. The sentence comes after he pleaded guilty to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct in Ingham County last November. During a seven-day hearing that started on Jan. 12, more than 160 women and girls said in court that Nassar sexually abused them, The New York Times reported.
Nassar, 54, apologized before the sentencing, saying the words of the women who testified had “shaken” him to his “core.” He said, “I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.” Before delivering the sentence, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina read a letter Nassar submitted to the court last week in which he said he was “manipulated” into pleading guilty, his treatments were “medical, not sexual,” and the media had convinced his accusers that “everything I did was wrong and bad.” Judge Aquilina said to Nassar, “I find that you don't get it, that you're a danger. That you remain a danger.”
Nassar’s accusers include five Olympic gold medal gymnasts: Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Jordyn Wieber and Simone Biles. Among other accusations, Nassar was accused of penetrating some of his patients with ungloved fingers and touching their bare breasts. Some of the accusers were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged events. 
U.S.A. Gymnastics fired Nassar in 2015 citing “athlete concerns.” Nassar disputed this claim, saying he left voluntarily. After he was fired, Nassar continued to work as a doctor at Michigan State University. The university received a complaint about Nassar in 2014. The school found no violations of its policies, and allowed him to continue his work there under some restrictions, such as not being allowed to make skin-to-skin contact in certain areas of patients’ bodies without another person in the room. The school fired Nassar in September 2016 after the Indianapolis Star reported allegations of sexual misconduct against him. 
On Tuesday, the N.C.A.A. opened an investigation of Michigan State University’s actions regarding Nassar. The school has asked the state attorney general to investigate as well. Following the sentencing on Wednesday, Michigan state lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the university’s president to be removed.
The chairman and some of the board of the U.S. gymnastics national governing body, U.S.A. Gymnastics, resigned this week. The U.S. Olympic Committee called for all U.S.A. Gymnastics board members to resign following the announcement of the sentence.
In a separate case, Nassar was convicted on child pornography charges and sentenced in December to 60 years in federal prison. He has also pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County; the sentencing hearing will begin on Jan. 31.

23142,2018-01-25,US Treasury sanctions parties suspected of supporting North Korea’s WMD program,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions on nine entities, 16 individuals and six ships suspected of supporting North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs and “other illicit businesses.” The department also said the sanctions were “in response to North Korea’s ongoing development of” WMD’s and “continued violations” of U.N. resolutions. The sanctions bar Americans from “dealing with any of the designated parties.”
One of the 16 individuals sanctioned by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) was an official from the Workers' Party of Korea, North Korea’s ruling party. OFAC also sanctioned ten individuals working with the Korea Ryonbong General Corporation, some of them operating out of China, Russia and Georgia. The Ryonbong General Corporation supplies North Korean defense industries with goods, according to OFAC. OFAC’s list of sanctioned individuals also included five North Korean “financial representatives.” 
Of the nine entities sanctioned by OFAC, two were Chinese companies: Beijing Chengxing Trading Co., Ltd. and Dandong Jinxiang Trade Co., Ltd. OFAC also sanctioned five North Korean shipping companies, a North Korean electronics company, Hana Electronics JVC, and North Korea’s Ministry of Crude Oil Industry.
Last week U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended a meeting in Vancouver to discuss North Korea with representatives from 19 other countries. China and Russia did not attend. Among other topics, attendees reportedly discussed how to ensure sanctions on North Korea were being enforced. There have been recent reports of ships, including Chinese ones, suspected of violating U.N. sanctions by transferring certain goods to North Korean ships.

23136,2018-01-25,Two monkeys are first primates cloned using method that produced Dolly the sheep,"Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers announced Tuesday that a lab in Shanghai had cloned two identical monkeys, born 10 days apart. The lab used the same technique that was used to produce a cloned sheep named Dolly over 20 years ago. The monkeys, named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, were the first primates cloned by this technique, according to Kevin Sinclair, a developmental biologist who was not involved in the experiment. Scientists said cloned monkeys could aid in disease research.
Catherine VandeVoort, a scientist from the California National Primate Research Center, said primates that are genetically the same could help researchers isolate effects resulting from behavioral or drug treatments. Qiang Sun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience said cloned monkeys would be useful for studying genetic illnesses such as some cancers, metabolic and immune disorders.
The technique used to clone the long-tailed macaque monkeys is called somatic cell nuclear transfer. The method involves taking a cell nucleus – where a monkey’s genetic material is stored – from a primate scientists want to clone, and inserting it into a donated egg. After treating the egg with chemicals, it is then implanted into a surrogate monkey. The technique resulted in two successful births out of 79 attempts, when tissue from monkey fetuses were used.
The Chinese scientists who performed the cloning said they followed U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research during their studies. A member of the cloning team said, “There is no intention for us to apply this method to humans.”

23145,2018-01-25,"Trump immigration plan would grant provisional legal status, path to citizenship to DACA enrollees","U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to offer a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. The plan, to be released Monday, would also grant provisional legal status to DACA enrollees, according to White House aides. As part of the deal, Trump said he wants $25 billion in funding for a U.S.-Mexican border wall and $5 billion for increased border security.
Trump’s plan would also eliminate or change the diversity visa lottery system and put a limit on family-based immigration, the White House said.
Trump said the immigrants covered under DACA, known as “dreamers,” could pursue full U.S. citizenship in 10 to 12 years. Dreamers would have to satisfy certain requirements to qualify for citizenship. 
DACA granted work permits to immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump’s administration announced in September that it was ending DACA and gave Congress six months to pass legislation to continue the program. Enrollees of the program whose permits expired before Mar. 5, 2018 were allowed to apply before Oct. 5, 2017 for a two-year renewal. New permits would not be approved, the announcement said.
A partial government shutdown occurred on Saturday after lawmakers failed to approve a short-term spending bill the night before. On Monday, the Senate voted to extend government funding until Feb. 8. If they don’t pass a spending plan by then, the government may shutdown again. Some lawmakers have indicated that they would not vote for a long-term spending bill unless DACA is addressed.

23225,2018-01-26,US Justice Department recovers missing FBI text messages,"The U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Inspector General said that some missing text messages between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page have been recovered. The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, said that some messages sent between the two during a five month period last year had been recovered using forensic tools. Strzok and Page, two senior FBI officials, are former members of Robert Mueller’s investigative team. Strzok was removed after a text message allegedly showed he had a bias against the president. 
Strzok and Page have investigated both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. They participated in the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, as well as the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russian agents during the 2016 presidential election. 
In December, The Washington Post reported that in July 2017 Strzok was removed from the Mueller investigation into Trump’s campaign, after an internal investigation found he and Page exchanged messages critical of Trump and messages in support of Clinton while investigating both politicians. Page had left the investigative team two weeks prior, reportedly due to an unrelated reason.  
On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated that Strzok and Page exchanged more than 50,000 texts between Dec. 14, 2016 and May 17, 2017. Federal officials announced Wednesday that thousands of FBI cell phones had a technical glitch, preventing Strzok and Page from uploading messages into the FBI’s archive system. 
Horowitz said that copies of the messages would be provided to the DOJ and that attempts to recover additional messages are “ongoing.”

23228,2018-01-26,Trump arrives at World Economic Forum to meet with business and political leaders,"U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday to attend the World Economic Forum, an annual meeting of business and political leaders. After his arrival on Thursday, Trump met individually with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with British Prime Minister Theresa May. He then met with European business executives Thursday night, and was due to meet with Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Swiss President Alain Berset on Friday. Trump is scheduled to address the Forum on Friday.
Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to attend the annual meeting since Bill Clinton went in 2000. Trump said he was going to meet people “who want to invest lots of money” in the U.S. “It’s about coming to America, investing your money, creating jobs, companies coming in,” he said.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S.’ goal for attending the summit is to “interact with important counterparts,” adding that “economic growth in the U.S. is obviously good for the rest of the world.” 
Earlier this week, Mnuchin commented that “a weaker dollar is good for us ... as it relates to trade and opportunities.” On Thursday, he remarked that the U.S. is “not concerned” about the short-term value of the dollar, which declined to a three-year low compared to the Euro this week. 
On Monday, Trump approved new tariffs on imported washing machines and most imported solar modules. Mnuchin said the Trump administration believes in “free and fair trade” and wants U.S. “opportunities” to equal “other people’s opportunities in the U.S.”

23231,2018-01-26,EU court bans testing sexual orientation of refugee applicants,"On Thursday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that European Union (EU) countries could not use psychological tests to determine whether people applying for refugee status are homosexual. EU countries can grant asylum to individuals who are jailed for homosexuality in their home countries, according to a 2013 ECJ decision. Some EU countries use psychological tests to determine whether refugee applicants are telling the truth about their sexual orientation.
The ECJ ruling said the psychological tests are only “approximate in nature,” and that “the performance of such a test amounts to a disproportionate interference in the private life of the asylum seeker.”
Thursday’s ruling relates to a 2015 case between a Nigerian national and the Hungarian Office for Immigration and Citizenship. Same-sex acts are illegal in many African nations, including Nigeria, and the man applied for asylum in Hungary on that basis. The applicant, referred to as “F,” was denied asylum in Hungary after a psychological test he was given concluded it “was not possible to confirm” his sexual orientation. 
The tests included an examination of his personality and three specific personality tests, including a Rorschach inkblot test. The ECJ determined on Thursday that the tests had not given an assessment “of the plausibility of his sexual orientation.” The ECJ asked a court in Hungary to reconsider F’s application.
The ECJ ruling is legally binding in all 28 EU countries, and the Hungarian court cannot appeal the decision.

23236,2018-01-26,South Africa: Cape Town’s mayor predicts city will run out of water in April,"Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille said earlier this week that the South African city could run out of water on April 12 due to drought. Cape Town officials originally predicted that water would run out on April 21, a date referred to as “Day Zero.” Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said on Tuesday that “due to a drop in the dam levels of 1.4 percent, Day Zero has, as of today, moved forward.” 
Neilson said that desalination (the removal of salt from sea water) and aquifer projects would not produce enough water to prevent the city from running out of drinking water.
In a statement released on Monday, the mayor’s office said that starting Feb. 2, Cape Town’s 3.7 million residents would have a daily allowance of 50 liters, or slightly more than 13 gallons, per person for the next 150 days, or face fines for exceeding use. Residents have been asked to limit showers to 90 seconds, and some are reusing bath water to flush toilets, CNN reported. 
“We can no longer ask people to stop wasting water. We must force them,” the mayor’s statement said. The city council is scheduled to vote on Friday to impose a punitive tariff for water usage over 6,000 liters (1,585 gallons) per month.

23379,2018-01-29,Trump to give his first State of the Union address on Tuesday,"U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to give his first State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Jan. 30.
In a briefing to reporters on Friday, an administration official said Trump’s address would be bipartisan, optimistic and “forward-looking.” The official said the speech would cover the topics of jobs and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security.
What is the State of the Union?
The State of the Union address is written into the U.S. Constitution’s Article ll, Section 3, which says the president “shall from time to time give to the Congress Information on the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” Since 1790, with some exceptions, it has been given annually, except in inauguration years, when the speech is considered an ""address to Congress.” Each year, one member of the president’s cabinet is absent from the address in order to ensure a line of succession in case of an emergency.
In 1966, members of the opposition party began giving a televised response to the president’s address. This year’s response will be given by Representative Joseph Kennedy lll (D-Mass.), according to Fox News.
Over the years, the address has been given both orally and as a written address. President Harry Truman’s 1947 address was the first to be televised. The New York Times reported that 48 million people watched President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech in 2010.

23382,2018-01-29,Spanish court ruling: Puigdemont cannot be sworn in as new Catalan president while abroad,"Spain’s Constitutional Court ruled on Saturday that former Catalan leader and current presidential candidate Carles Puigdemont could only attend a swearing-in ceremony if he is physically present in parliament and had a judge’s approval to attend. The court’s decision was unanimous. Puigdemont left Spain for Belgium in October last year, after Spain dissolved Catalan’s parliament following its declaration of independence.
Puigdemont is currently the only candidate proposed for the Catalan presidency. The Catalan parliament is due to vote for a new president on Tuesday.
The Constitutional Court also said it would decide whether it would accept the government’s request to challenge the legitimacy of Puigdemont’s candidacy once it had spoken to all parties concerned. Under Spanish law, if the court accepts the request, Puigdemont’s candidacy will be suspended while the court deliberates its legitimacy.
After an independence referendum on Oct. 1, which a Spanish court ruled unconstitutional, Puigdemont declared Catalan independence from Spain. As a result, the Spanish government brought charges of sedition and rebellion against Puigdemont and other Catalan lawmakers. If convicted of these charges, Puigdemont could be sentenced to as many as 30 years in prison.
After imposing direct rule in Catalonia, the Spanish government called for a new election for the regional parliament on Dec. 20. Independence supporters won a majority in this election. Puigdemont’s party, Junts per Catalunya (“Together for Catalonia”), said on Saturday that there was no legal basis to bar him from being president. His supporters have argued he could rule remotely from Brussels using video link technology.

Thirty police officers were among the injured, according to Kabul police chief Basir Mojahid. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which happened in an area with shops, government offices, foreign embassies and the office of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council. The head of Afghanistan’s intelligence service, Masoom Stanekzai, said four people have been arrested in connection with the attack.
Interior Minister Wais Ahmad Barmak said the bomb had been concealed in an ambulance, and exploded after the ambulance passed a security checkpoint. The driver told police officers he was transferring a patient to the hospital, according to ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi. The ambulance was then stopped and identified at a second checkpoint, Rahimi said, and the attacker detonated the explosives before authorities could apprehend him.
The Afghan government declared Monday to be a public holiday and Tuesday a day of prayer for the victims, according to presidential spokesperson Shah Hussain Murtazawi.

23388,2018-01-29,Steve Wynn resigns as RNC finance committee chairman,"Steve Wynn resigned as the Republican National Congress (RNC) finance committee chairman on Saturday. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel confirmed the resignation. Wynn's announcement occurred a day after allegations were published that he had engaged in sexual misconduct with employees of casinos he owns. Wynn denied the allegations.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on Friday about the accusations, which include that Wynn allegedly pressured female employees to engage in sexual intercourse or to give him naked massages.
Wynn, 76, released a statement Saturday saying, “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” adding that, “We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits.” He said the accusations we a “distraction” to the Republican agenda.
Wynn is a Las Vegas casino owner. After the 2016 election, President Donald Trump selected him to oversee the RNC’s fundraising activities as chairman of the finance committee. Wynn has personally donated more than $2.5 million to the Republican Governors Association and $411,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee since 2012. He has also donated to Democratic candidates, according to the New York Times.
It has not yet been announced who will replace Wynn as chairman.

23460,2018-01-30,US Senate blocks bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy,"On Monday, the U.S. Senate voted 51 to 46 to reject a bill banning abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy. To pass, the bill required 60 votes from the Senate, where 51 Republican senators hold a majority over 47 Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) co-sponsored the bill. The 1973 “Roe v. Wade” Supreme Court ruling legalized abortion through about 28 weeks of pregnancy.
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act argued that a fetus could begin feeling pain after 20 weeks gestation. The bill sought to make performing or attempting to perform an abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy illegal. If passed, doctors would face fines and up to five years in prison if found in violation. The bill exempted women whose lives are deemed at risk, as well as rape and incest victims, provided they reported the crime to authorities, and received medical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours before the abortion.
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists President Haywood L. Brown said the bill “ignor[ed] scientific evidence regarding fetal inability to experience pain at the gestational age.”
The House of Representatives passed an identical bill in October, voting 237 to 189.
President Donald Trump backed the 2018 bill, Politico reported. The Trump administration has allowed states to exclude abortion providers from Medicaid and Title X family planning programs. 
Twenty U.S. states have passed similar bills, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research group that tracks reproductive health policy.

23463,2018-01-30,House Intelligence Committee votes to release memo on Russia investigation,"The House Intelligence Committee voted Monday to release a memorandum alleging the Justice Department (DOJ) and the FBI misused their authority to obtain a warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
The memo, written by the committee’s Chairman Devin Nunes, alleges both the FBI and the DOJ violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to obtain and extend a warrant for Page. Republicans said the agencies failed to disclose that “the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign helped finance research that was used to obtain a warrant” for Page’s surveillance, the New York Times reported.
The Times also said the memo indicates Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein authorized a surveillance extension on Page, saying there was reason to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.
President Donald Trump now has five days to decide whether to make the document public, according to voting rules invoked by the committee.
Last week, the DOJ sent a letter to Nunes asking to review the memo before releasing it, citing possible concerns with national security and the potential obstruction of ongoing investigations. The letter adds that the DOJ is “unaware of any wrongdoing related to the FISA process.”
U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether any members of Trump’s campaign team cooperated with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

23469,2018-01-30,Andrew McCabe resigns as FBI Deputy Director,"FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe resigned on Monday, sources speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press (AP). Sources told Fox News that McCabe was “removed” from his post. FBI Assistant Deputy Director David Bowdich was appointed acting deputy director, effective Monday.
McCabe is a lawyer who joined the FBI in 1996 and worked on organized crime in New York. He became deputy director in 2016, and served as acting director following former FBI Director James Comey’s firing on May 9 of last year.
McCabe was eligible to retire in March of this year, but due to accumulated leave, he was able to step down earlier, CNN reported. Fox News said he was “taking vacation until he reaches his planned retirement in a matter of weeks.”
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later on Monday that neither President Donald Trump nor the White House had been part of McCabe’s decision to retire, which the media first reported on in December.
Trump has accused McCabe of “bias because of his wife’s political connections and an FBI investigation that produced no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton,” AP reported.

23613,2018-01-31,Trump gives first State of the Union address,"U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. During his 80-minute speech, Trump discussed infrastructure investment, immigration and foreign affairs. He also spoke about the tax legislation passed in December, lower unemployment rates and efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Trump said his administration had met with Democrats and Republicans recently to collaborate on immigration reform. He also reviewed his plan to offer “a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age,” also known as “Dreamers.” The plan also calls for funding a border wall, ending the visa lottery and limiting family-sponsored immigration.
On foreign affairs, Trump said North Korea’s nuclear missile program could “soon threaten” the United States, and asked Congress to remove budget caps and increase military spending. “We must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it,” Trump said.
As for potential initiatives in 2018, Trump called on Congress “to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.”
Regarding tax cuts in the recently passed legislation, Trump said “a typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000.” He also said unemployment rates were at a 45-year low, with African-American unemployment at its lowest level “ever recorded.”
In his speech, Trump also reported efforts to defeat the Islamic State had “liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held” by the group in Iraq and Syria.

23592,2018-01-31,Texas Rangers to investigate allegations of misconduct at Karolyi Ranch,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday asked the Texas Rangers to conduct a criminal investigation into allegations of misconduct at the Karolyi Ranch, a former USA Gymnastics training facility north of Houston. The announcement comes after Dr. Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison last week for sexual misconduct involving female gymnasts. Some of the female athletes have said Nassar abused them while they were being treated at the Karolyi Ranch.
Nassar did not have a Texas medical license while treating athletes at the ranch, according to The Dallas Morning News.
The Karolyi Ranch is owned by former national team coordinators Bela and Martha Karolyi. A 2016 California lawsuit alleged that the Karolyi couple had knowledge of abuses at the facility but did not stop them. USA Gymnastics ended its collaboration with the ranch on Jan. 18 after Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles said Nassar abused her at the ranch.
The Walker County Sheriff’s Office announced last week that it was investigating what happened at the Karolyi Ranch. Abbott asked the Rangers and the Sheriff’s Office to collaborate on the case, which involves allegations spread over several states.

23595,2018-01-31,US Treasury Department releases list naming 210 Russian ‘political figures’ and businesspeople,"The U.S. Treasury Department published a list late Monday with the names of 210 Russian “senior political figures” and businesspeople. The publication of the list was required as part of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The act was adopted in August last year and imposed sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The names on the list included 114 government officials or people allegedly linked to the Russian government. The remaining 96 names are those of businesspeople, all with a net worth of more than $1 billion, according to BBC. The Treasury Department press release stated the list does not impose sanctions on those named on the list, and inclusion on the list does not “indicate that the US government has information about the individual's involvement in malign activities.”
Some of the sanctions imposed on Russia by CAATSA were limitations on the amount of money U.S. citizens can invest in Russian energy projects and restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with Russia.

23572,2018-01-31,Fetal pain and abortion,"On Monday, the U.S. Senate voted on the “Pain-Capable Unborn Child” bill, which seeks to restrict abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill didn’t receive enough votes to prevent a filibuster, meaning it can be voted on again, reworked or tabled. The following information, although not by any means complete, is intended to outline some of the research available on fetal pain.
The bill focuses on the argument that there’s “substantial medical evidence” that a fetus is capable of experiencing pain by at least 20 weeks after conception as its reason to ban abortion after this stage. Although there are other considerations in the broader debate on abortion, we will focus here on exploring some of the science behind this specific issue. 
Note: The bill’s use of “unborn child” refers to a 20-week old fetus. According to the Merck Manual, the embryo is considered a fetus at the end of the eighth week after conception, or after 10 weeks of pregnancy.
What does the bill say about fetal pain?
The bill says there’s medical research that shows “strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.” Some physicians disagree, saying a fetus requires certain neurological development to sense pain, specifically, that it needs the cerebral cortex as well as nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. 
The bill said Congress had two findings: One, that “by no later than 20 weeks,” pain receptors (nociceptors) exist throughout the fetus’ body, and that nerves link those receptors to the brain’s thalamus and subcortical plate. Two, that by 8 weeks after conception, the embryo reacts to touch. The bill added that after 20 weeks, the fetus reacts to stimuli that an adult would recognize as painful, for example, by recoiling.
What is the cerebral cortex?
The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the brain, or cerebrum. The cerebral cortex is divided into four parts or “lobes”: frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal. At the bottom of the cerebral cortex is the thalamus, which is part of the limbic system (a system of nerves and networks in the brain that relate to instinct and mood). The thalamus relays sensory input to the cerebral cortex.
What data supports fetuses sensing pain?
According to a 2006 article by Dr. Kanwaljeet Anand, fetal pain may not be connected to the cerebral cortex because some adults who’ve had cortex tissue removed can continue to feel pain. This would support the conclusion cited in the bill that says a functioning cortex isn’t necessary to sense pain. 
In a 2008 paper entitled “Developmental Perspectives: Is the Fetus Conscious?”, Dr. Roland Brusseau wrote that connections to the thalamus are involved in responses to nociception that are observed in fetuses as early as 18 weeks. He said “perhaps” the subcortex, which includes the thalamus, is “sufficient” for “minimal” consciousness that “may render an integrated experience of nociception that we might call pain.”
What data supports fetuses not sensing pain?
Factcheck.org noted that a fetus’ reaction to touch as possible evidence of pain perception (which the Senate bill mentions) may be reflexive and not necessarily connected to pain. A 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said withdrawal reflexes and hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures don’t prove that fetuses sense pain, because those things “can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing.”
Other medical organizations say the cerebral cortex is needed to feel pain. In 2010, Britain’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists concluded that a fetus cannot feel pain prior to 24 weeks gestation: “the periphery to the cortex are not intact before 24 weeks of gestation and, as most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception, it can be concluded that the fetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior to this gestation.” It also noted evidence that the fetus doesn’t experience “a state of true wakefulness in utero” due to its chemical environment. It said the fetus in utero is in a “continuous sleep-like unconsciousness or sedation.” 
A 2013 memo by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists came to a similar conclusion, saying the connections needed to transmit signals from “peripheral sensory nerves to the brain,” and the brain structures necessary to process those signals, don’t develop until at least 24 weeks of gestation.
The 2005 JAMA study found that the “conscious perception of pain” occurs after thalamocortical pathways begin to function, which it estimated to be around 29 to 30 weeks’ gestation, “based on the limited data available.”
How frequent are abortions after 20 weeks?
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) tracks abortion data voluntarily provided by states and other “reporting areas.” Below is the CDC’s 2014 abortion data based on the number of weeks of gestation:

	91.5 percent of abortions were performed by 13 weeks’ gestation or earlier.
	7.2 percent were performed between 14 and 20 weeks' gestation.
	1.3 percent were performed at 21 weeks' gestation or later.

What do people in the US think of abortion?
National Review, which was one of the outlets we analyzed, cited a Marist poll that said, “nearly two-thirds of Americans support a 20-week abortion ban.” The poll, sponsored by The Knights of Columbus, was based on the aggregate of two surveys: one of 1,267 adults conducted Dec. 4-7, 2017, and another of 1,350 adults conducted Jan. 8-10, 2018. Other U.S. polls provide different results. Below are some examples.
Marist: “More than three quarters of Americans would limit abortion to — at most — the first three months of pregnancy.”

23721,2018-02-01,UK Channel 4 interviews Jordan Peterson; presenter receives online threats,"On Jan. 16, British Channel 4 News journalist Cathy Newman interviewed Canadian clinical psychologist and University of Toronto professor Jordan B. Peterson. During the interview Newman and Peterson discussed the gender pay gap in the U.K., gender equality and gender neutral pronouns, among other topics. After the interview, Channel 4 News said Newman received “unwarranted and unacceptable misogynistic abuse and threats” online. Peterson responded on Twitter asking his followers to refrain from threatening Newman and to be “civilized” in their criticism.
Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear said the media company was calling in “security specialists in to carry out an analysis” of the threats. British news outlet The Independent reported that a search of Twitter showed messages calling Newman a “b - - - -,” and a “f - - -ing idiot.”
A Twitter search shows Peterson also received abusive comments following the interview, such as ones calling him a “d - - - head” or saying it “must have taken huge self-control not to punch” him.
Peterson became publicly known in 2016, after he published a YouTube video explaining his objections to Bill C-16 – Canadian legislation that adds “gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination” under the Canadian Human Rights Act. This subject came up in Peterson’s interview with Newman when he explained his objections to “compelled speech” laws mandating the use of gender-neutral pronouns.
Peterson was in the U.K. to promote his new book called “12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos.”

23682,2018-02-01,"1 dead, 1 in critical condition after train carrying GOP lawmakers collides with garbage truck","A chartered train carrying Republican lawmakers collided with a garbage truck at a railway crossing in Crozet, Virginia, on Wednesday morning. One of the three men in the truck was killed. Six other people were injured, one of whom is in critical condition. None of the lawmakers, their families or aides were seriously injured. The train was headed to a retreat for Republicans in West Virginia. The National Transportation Safety Board said it is starting an investigation.
Following the accident, some of the lawmakers who were physicians helped treat the men in the truck and carried at least one to an ambulance. Six people were taken to the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville for treatment. Rep. Jason Lewis (R-Minn.) sustained a concussion and was released from hospital after treatment, according to his spokesman.
Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.) was walking to the train’s restroom when the train hit the truck. He sustained neck, back and foot injuries as a result of the collision, USA Today reported.
According to The Washington Post, the lead car of the train derailed “slightly” and was unhooked from the rest of the train and left at the scene. The rest of the train then returned to Charlottesville Union Station. Lawmakers took buses from there to the retreat in White Sulphur Springs.
The Congressional Institute said the GOP retreat would still be held, with an “adjusted program.” U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at the retreat on Thursday.

23685,2018-02-01,CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald resigns over stock holdings,"The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, resigned on Wednesday. After assuming the role in July, she was recused from working on certain issues due to conflicts of interest with stocks she held. She reportedly still holds some of them. On Tuesday, Politico reported that Fitzgerald had bought tobacco stock in August. Following Fitzgerald’s resignation, CDC’s principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, became acting director. 
A statement from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said, “Dr. Fitzgerald owns certain complex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all of her duties as the CDC Director. Due to the nature of these financial interests, Dr. Fitzgerald could not divest from them in a definitive time period. After advising [HHS Secretary Alex Azar] of both the status of the financial interests and the scope of her recusal, Dr. Fitzgerald tendered, and the Secretary accepted, her resignation. The Secretary thanks Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald for her service and wishes her the best in all her endeavors."" 
After she became CDC head, Fitzgerald’s financial manager reportedly bought stocks for her that presented conflict of interest issues. On Aug. 8, Fitzgerald bought between $1,001 and $15,000 in stock in Japan Tobacco, which owns four brands of cigarettes sold in the United States. After July, she also bought stock in two pharmaceutical companies, Merck  Co. and Bayer, and a health insurance company, Humana. 
Fitzgerald reportedly sold the tobacco stock in October. By November, she had reportedly sold the rest of the aforementioned stocks, at least those above the $1,000 value limit that must be reported due to the Stock Act.
Fitzgerald hasn’t attended some meetings due to her recusals. Sen. Patricia Murray (D-Wash.) said that Fitzgerald had deputies testify at Congressional hearings on opioid use on at least three occasions. 
Former HHS Secretary Tom Price appointed Fitzgerald as CDC director. Fitzgerald is an obstetrician and gynecologist from Georgia.

23686,2018-02-01,"US State Department designates 3 groups, Hamas political leader as ‘terrorists’","On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of State designated three groups and one individual as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), and imposed sanctions against them. The State Department named three groups operating in Israel or Egypt — Harakat al-Sabireen, Liwa al-Thawra and HASM — as SDGTs. It also designated Ismail Haniyeh, president of the Palestinian Hamas Political Bureau, as an SDGT, saying he “has close links with Hamas’ military wing.”
According to Al Jazeera, Haniyeh, 54, was born in Gaza and was elected president of Hamas’ political wing in May 2017. The State Department said Haniyeh was allegedly “involved” in terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens and “has been a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians.”
The department designated Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997 and an SDGT in 2001. Israel, the EU and the U.K. have also designated Hamas a terrorist group. Hamas was founded in 1987 and through its military wing, has waged three wars against Israel and its occupation of the Gaza Strip since 2008. The State Department said Hamas is responsible for terrorist attacks that have killed an estimated 17 Americans.
The department said two of the groups it designated as SDGTs, Liwa al-Thawra and HASM, are active in Egypt, and have each claimed responsibility for assassinations and attacks there. It said the third group, Harakat al-Sabireen, is Iranian-backed, and operates primarily in Gaza and the West Bank, carrying out terrorist attacks against Israel.
As a result of these designations, the State Department issued sanctions saying, “Among other consequences, all of their property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them.” A travel ban to the U.S. is also placed on SDGT designees.

23691,2018-02-01,Hong Kong to ban all sales of ivory by 2021,"On Wednesday, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council voted 49-4 to ban all ivory sales by 2021. Only “antique” ivory, acquired before the 1970s, had been legal for sale in Hong Kong since 1990 under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Hong Kong’s legislation is to phase out all ivory trade over the next three years by not renewing sellers’ licenses that expire before 2021. The legislation also increased penalties for crimes related to wildlife.
Last year, Hong Kong authorities discovered two ivory dealers selling chopsticks made from non-antique ivory, obtained from elephants after 1990, in violation of CITES.
WildAid, a non-governmental wildlife organization, estimates that up to 30,000 elephants are illegally killed each year, some for their tusks.
China, the world’s largest consumer of ivory, banned its sale a month ago. Ivory has been traded in Hong Kong for more than 150 years, according to Reuters.

23931,2018-02-02,Poland's senate approves bill outlawing references to Polish complicity in the Holocaust,"On Thursday, the Polish senate voted to approve a bill that prohibits certain speech alleging Poland was complicit in crimes committed by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. The legislation allows exceptions for academic research and works of art. The Senate passed the bill 57 to 23, with two abstentions, and Polish President Andrzej Duda has 21 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law. If enacted, phrases like “Polish death camp” would be illegal, and penalties for violations could include fines and up to three years in prison. 
The Polish Foreign Ministry said the purpose of the legislation was to “fight all forms of denying and distorting the truth about the Holocaust as well as belittling the responsibility of its actual perpetrators.”
“We hold the view that accusing — publicly and despite facts to the contrary — the Polish Nation and the Polish State of complicity with the German Third Reich in Nazi crimes is inaccurate, misleading, and hurtful to the victims who are Polish citizens of both Jewish and Polish descent,” the ministry added.
On Monday, Duda said the nation has the right to defend itself from “evident slander.” 
The U.S. State Department has said the U.S. opposes the legislation, saying it could “undermine free speech.” Israel also opposes the bill, saying that it misrepresents history. The Polish foreign ministry said the bill would not inhibit freedom of research and scholarship, freedom of historical debate or “artistic activity.”
The Holocaust in Poland 
Nazi Germany occupied Poland in 1939, and established concentration camps on Polish soil. The camps include Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. Although no single wartime count exists, an estimated 18.5 million people were killed by Nazis, including in concentration camps, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. This includes around 6 million Jewish people.
Up to 3 million Polish Jews were killed in the Holocaust, as well as an estimated 2.7 million non-Jewish Poles. According to Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial, only 380,000 of Poland’s pre-war Jewish population survived the war.
Yad Vashem has commemorated people for rescuing Jews from execution, including 6,700 Poles, the largest number of any country. They were honored with the title, “Righteous Among the Nations.” The Yad Vashem memorial also said that there were instances where Polish citizens helped the Germans.
Response to the bill
The Israel Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that the country “adamantly opposes” the bill, and “any attempt to challenge historical truth.”
Prior to Thursday’s vote, the U.S. State Department said, “We encourage Poland to reevaluate the legislation in light of its potential impact on the principle of free speech and on our ability to be effective partners.” The department said the legislation could “undermine free speech and academic discourse.” 
In response to the U.S.’ statement, the Polish foreign ministry said, “despite differences of opinion on the draft legislation,” the bill to “protect historical truth” would not “affect Poland’s strategic partnership with the United States.”

23934,2018-02-02,DHS extends protection for Syrians currently under TPS,"The U.S. will extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to the estimated 6,900 Syrian nationals in the U.S. who are already part of the program. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the 18-month extension on Wednesday. Under the extension, new Syrian immigrants will not be able to apply for TPS.
TPS allows immigrants to work in the U.S. and gives them temporary relief from deportation if conditions in their home countries are deemed unsafe. DHS first granted the TPS designation to Syria in 2012, about a year into its ongoing civil war. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the department is granting the extension because the conditions still exist in Syria that qualify it for the designation. 
Current TPS protections were due to end in two months.  The DHS said it would evaluate and make a new decision about TPS status for Syrians after the 18-month extension expires.
Eligibility for the TPS extension requires that the Syrians have continuously lived in the U.S. since Aug. 1, 2016. and have remained physically present in the country since Oct. 1, 2016. This will be the first time since 2012 that the U.S. will not allow new applicants from Syria.

23937,2018-02-02,Canada passes bill to make national anthem gender neutral,"The Canadian government voted to amend the text of the English-language version of the country’s national anthem, O Canada, to make it gender neutral. The measure would change the phrase “in all thy sons command” to “in all of us command.” The legislation will be sent to the Governor General, the Queen’s representative in Canada, to be signed before officially becoming law. 
The Canadian Senate passed the bill on Wednesday, with a voice vote between Liberal and independent senators. Conservative senators boycotted the motion and missed the final vote. The amendment had previously passed the House of Commons in 2016.
O Canada, written in 1908 by Robert Stanley Weir, officially became Canada’s anthem in 1980. Since then, 12 bills have been introduced into the House, attempting to remove the reference to “sons.”

24020,2018-02-03,Get the facts without spin on the House committee's memo,"U.S. House Republicans released a declassified memorandum on Friday that says there were “concerns with legitimacy and legality” in FBI and Department of Justice efforts to obtain a 2016 surveillance warrant for a member of Trump’s presidential campaign. President Donald Trump approved the release of the memo and did not request any redactions, according to White House spokesman Raj Shah.
The memo relates to the process used to obtain a warrant through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to surveil Carter Page, a U.S. citizen and volunteer adviser on the Trump campaign. The document, written by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his staff to the Republican majority on the committee, is based on testimony from then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who resigned last week.
The House committee voted along party lines on Jan. 29 to publicly release the previously classified memo, and then sent it to Trump for approval, in accordance with House Rule X, clause 11(g). (The committee could then release the memo unless the president sent a written notification within five days that release would be a “threat to the national interest.”) 
In a letter to the committee chair, Trump’s attorney Donald McGahn II wrote that, after review with a legal team, Trump determined it was “appropriate” to release the memo in accordance with standards that “permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to protect the information.”
Prior to release, the FBI had advised against releasing the memo publicly, citing “concerns” over “material omissions” that impact the memo’s accuracy. The FBI statement did not specify what was omitted. 
Democrats on the intelligence committee wrote a memo in response that claims the Republican memo mischaracterizes McCabe’s testimony. The committee voted in favor of releasing the minority’s memo to the full House, but against releasing it to the public. 
The Nunes memo
The memo concludes that the FBI’s use of FISA “raises concerns about the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions” with the court that grants FISA requests, and a “troubling breakdown” of the FISA process. According to the memo, the application for a probable cause FISA warrant on Page, which was granted on Oct. 21, 2016, cited a “dossier” on Trump that was compiled by Christopher Steele. McCabe testified that the FBI would not have sought the warrant without the dossier, according to the memo.
Steele, a former British intelligence agent, had worked as an FBI source, but compiled the dossier as opposition research for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. In the dossier, Steele alleged that Page met with Russian officials while on the Trump campaign and discussed the possibility of deals about sanctions, business opportunities and alleged Russian interference in the election. Page denies he engaged in any illegal acts or political deals with Russian officials.
The Nunes memo reports that the FISA warrant application, and three subsequent renewal applications, did not disclose that the DNC funded the dossier. It alleged the FBI and Department of Justice knew how the dossier was funded at the time. The FISA warrant also cited a September 2016 Yahoo News article, as supporting evidence for the application. The memo concludes that the news article “does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information” that Steele himself leaked to the outlet. Steele was later terminated as an FBI source for unauthorized disclosures to a separate media source, the memo reported.
Steele is quoted as allegedly saying he was “desperate” for Trump to not be elected, according to the memo. It says the FISA application relied on Steele’s past record of “credible reporting,” but “ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations.”
Read the full memo, as well as the letter from Trump’s lawyer, here.
In addition to the initial October 2016 FISA application, the warrant on Page was renewed three times. In order to grant renewals of the FISA warrant, which are needed every 90 days to stay in effect, the court would have determined that the investigation was resulting in enough information to merit renewal, CNN reported.
Comments on the release
On Wednesday, prior to the release of the memo, the FBI released a public statement that said the bureau had received “limited” time to review it, but that it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”
California Rep. Adam Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said on Friday that the memo “cherry picks” information from the McCabe testimony and misrepresents it.
In a statement released on Friday, the minority members of the committee said the Republican memo was a “shameful effort to discredit these institutions, undermine the Special Counsel’s ongoing investigation, and undercut congressional probes.”
“The Majority suggests that the FBI failed to alert the court as to Mr. Steele’s potential political motivations or the political motivations of those who hired him, but this is not accurate,” the statement said. “The GOP memo also claims that a Yahoo News article was used to corroborate Steele, but this is not at all why the article was referenced. These are but a few of the serious mischaracterizations of the FISA application,” the statement said.
Nunes told Fox News that he supported the release because he has “an obligation to the American people when we see FISA abuse.”
Page, who had been surveilled, said in a statement on Friday that the Congressional leaders discovered an “unprecedented abuse of process,” calling it a “historic leap in the repair of America's democracy.”

24084,2018-02-05,Pentagon announces change to US nuclear weapons policy,"The U.S. Department of Defense announced a new nuclear arms policy on Friday. The policy change is the first since 2010 and is the result of a Nuclear Posture Review requested by President Donald Trump last January. 
The previous policy called for a reduction in nuclear arms as part of U.S. commitments under a non-proliferation agreement. The new policy aims to “modernize” the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal and make it more flexible to address a changed “array of threats,” according to a White House statement. The statement said the new policy is needed because other nations have continued to develop their nuclear capabilities while the U.S. has reduced its arsenal. 
The policy introduces two new types of weapons: so-called “low-yield” weapons mounted on submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a nuclear submarine-launched cruise missile, or SLCM. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy John C. Rood said the plan would not increase the overall amount of stockpiled nuclear warheads. 
The SLCM has been in the U.S. arsenal before, but was removed under former President Barack Obama. The “low-yield” nuclear weapons, if detonated, could have destructive impact similar to the 1945 Hiroshima bomb, according to Financial Times and The Washington Post.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the goal for the new policy is to “convince adversaries they have nothing to gain and everything to lose from the use of nuclear weapons.” The new policy document states that the U.S. would only consider a nuclear attack under “extreme” circumstances. These circumstances could include “significant non-nuclear strategic attacks.” FT reported that these might include large-scale terrorist incidents like the September 11 attack.
In order to carry out the changes, the plan seeks to double the percentage of the Pentagon’s annual budget allocated to its nuclear program, bringing it up to 6.4 percent. Congress would need to approve this change. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the plan would cost around $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years.

24085,2018-02-05,White House to withdraw nomination for chair of environment body,"The White House confirmed Saturday that it would withdraw Kathleen Hartnett White’s nomination for the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). The chair of the CEQ is responsible for the development of new environmental policies and coordination among government agencies to carry them out. The Washington Post, which first reported the decision, said the nomination couldn’t win enough support, and that some Republican senators were “raising questions about her expertise.”
White has previously served on a commission overseeing Texas’ state environment agency, and as a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. White does not have a background in science.
White was originally nominated by President Donald Trump in October of last year. By the time the Senate adjourned for the year, it had not confirmed White. Trump subsequently renominated her in January.
In her November Senate confirmation hearing, White said “that while humans probably contribute to current warming, the extent to which, I think, is very uncertain,” according to NPR. She has called some climate scientists’ arguments “the dogmatic claims of ideologues.” During her Senate hearing, Democrats opposed her nomination.

24088,2018-02-05,Russian plane shot down in Syria; pilot killed,"Syrian opposition fighters shot down a Russian SU-25 warplane over Idlib province in northwestern Syria on Saturday, Russia’s Defense Ministry confirmed. The pilot ejected from the plane. He was later killed on the ground by opposition fighters attempting to capture him, according to Reuters. Tharir al-Sham, an armed opposition group, claimed responsibility for downing the plane with a portable shoulder launched anti-aircraft missile. Tharir al-Sham was previously known as al-Nusra Front and was connected with Al-Qaeda.
The plane was shot down in an area where the Syrian government is attempting to take back control from the opposition. Opposition fighters said the plane had participated in a strike targeting a civilian convoy, according to Reuters. The Russian Defense Ministry denied this.
Russian forces have supported the Syrian government in its fight against the opposition fighters since 2015. After the plane was shot down, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had carried out a precision strike killing more than 30 opposition fighters in the area.

24095,2018-02-05,US House Speaker Paul Ryan tweets about tax reform benefits; later deletes tweet,"On Saturday, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted about a number of people benefiting from the tax reform adopted by Congress in December. One of his tweets, which linked to an Associated Press article about the tax reform, cited a woman whose paycheck increased $1.50 per week. Ryan later deleted the tweet after some people responded on Twitter with negative comments, such as criticisms that a $1.50 increase was not a good endorsement for the tax plan.
The tweet that Ryan deleted said: “A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, PA, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week … she said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year.” The tweet linked to the AP article titled “Tax bill beginning to deliver bigger paychecks to workers.”
The AP article described how the new tax reform is affecting net pay for employees around the country, as their employers begin to implement the new tax rates. The article gave examples of people receiving from increases of $1.50 to $200 in last week’s paycheck. AP also cited the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center saying that a middle-income household would get an average tax cut of $930 in 2018, equalling an after-tax income increase of about 1.6 percent.
Ryan did not respond to requests for comment from AP or CNN.

24203,2018-02-06,Maldives declares 15-day state of emergency,"On Monday, Maldives President Abdulla Yameen declared a 15-day state of emergency. The measure follows a Supreme Court ruling that ordered the release of political prisoners. Legal Affairs Minister Azima Shakoor said the prisoners’ release “resulted in the disruption of the functions of the executive power, and the infringement of national security and public interest.” 
Shakoor announced the measure during a televised address, adding that “the government [did] not believe that the Supreme Court ruling ... [could] be enforced.” Under the state of emergency, judges will no longer be granted special privileges if they face arrest, Reuters reported.  
Yameen has been president of the Maldives since 2013, and has been reportedly accused of corruption and violations against freedom of speech. He has denied the allegations.
Last week, the court ordered the release of 12 lawmakers and ruled that the 2015 trial of former President Mohamed Nasheed was unconstitutional. Nasheed was convicted of ordering the arrest of a judge and was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He has resided in the U.K. as a political refugee since 2016, after traveling there for medical treatment.
Following Monday’s declaration, security forces blocked the court building with justices inside, according to a Supreme Court spokesman. Police arrested former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Al Jazeera reported. Gayoom is Yameen’s half-brother. The government also suspended congress and declared any court order to arrest Yameen illegal. 
Lawmakers from the opposition Maldivian Democratic party have signed a resolution asking the government to respect “the rule of law, and implement last Thursday’s Supreme Court ruling.”

24206,2018-02-06,USA Gymnastics doctor sentenced to additional 40 to 125 years for sexual misconduct,"U.S.A. Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced on Monday to an additional 40 to 125 years in prison after pleading guilty to molesting girls and young women at a Michigan gymnastics club.
For two days, Nassar listened to the testimonies of at least 48 athletes who said they were molested by him. Some of the accusations date back over two decades.
""The words expressed by everyone that has spoken, including the parents, have impacted me to my innermost core. I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotions that you all are feeling. It's impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved,"" Nassar said before his sentence at Michigan’s Eaton County Circuit Court.
“I do not believe there's a likelihood that you could be reformed,"" Judge Janice Cunningham told Nassar.
In 1997, two gymnasts reported Nassar, but an investigation was not initiated until 2004, when another girl reported abuse. The Associated Press said those reports did not result in criminal charges.
Monday’s was Nassar’s third and final sentence. Last month, a judge from Michigan’s Ingham County sentenced him to another 40 to 175 years in prison for sexual misconduct. In December, a U.S. district judge sentenced Nassar 54 to 60 years in federal prison on child pornography charges.

24209,2018-02-06,Supreme Court declines Pennsylvania GOP request to delay redistricting congressional map,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to delay redistricting the state congressional map ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Changing district boundaries can affect election outcomes depending on how voters are grouped. Currently, Republicans hold 12 of 18 of the state’s seats.
Following a challenge from Democrats, Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court said in January that existing congressional districts “clearly, plainly and palpably violat[ed] the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” and that these violations provided Republicans with a political advantage. The court requested redistricting the congressional map.
Republicans appealed the lower court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the federal constitution only granted legislatures, not state courts, the power to draw congressional districts, HuffPost reported. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito denied the appeal without referring it to the whole court.
According to the state ruling, Pennsylvania’s General Assembly must now submit a redistricting plan. “If the governor accepts the [...] plan, it shall be submitted to this court on or before February 15. If no plan is submitted, that court would adopt a plan based on the evidentiary record developed in the Commonwealth Court.""
Pennsylvania House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R) issued a statement saying they do not believe the state’s congressional map is unconstitutional.
In a 2017 report, the Brennan Center for Justice said, “Every decade, states redraw congressional maps after the decennial census. Redistricting allows districts to be rebalanced, ensuring in theory that all districts are both equally populated and representative.” The 2010 census marked the last time Pennsylvania's congressional maps were redrawn. 
Primary elections in Pennsylvania are scheduled for May 15.

24358,2018-02-07,Trump says if immigration legislation doesn’t change ‘let’s have a shutdown’,"On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said at a White House roundtable, “if we don’t change [the immigration legislation], let’s have a [government] shutdown.” The focus of the roundtable was on immigration and the crime group known as MS-13.
Trump said, “incredible professionals at the table cannot do their job unless we change, really, the legislation,"" and ""if we don’t rid of these loopholes"" that allow violent criminals into the country, ""let’s have a shutdown."" He said, ""it's worth it for our country. I’d love to see a shutdown if we don’t get this stuff taken care of.” 
At the end of the meeting, when Trump was asked to clarify his remarks on the issue, he said, ""I would shut it down over this issue. ... I can’t speak for our great representatives here, but I have a feeling they may agree with me."" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said the administration was “not advocating for a shutdown.”
If Congress doesn’t pass a spending plan by Thursday, the government may shutdown for the second time this year. Lawmakers have been discussing changes to immigration law as part of the spending deal negotiations.
January’s government shutdown
A three-day partial government shutdown took place last month when the Senate failed to approve a short-term spending bill. As part of the spending bill negotiations, Senate Democrats sought to extend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Democrats also asked for increased funding for disaster relief and opioid treatment programs.
The shutdown ended on Jan. 22 when the Senate approved a temporary spending bill to fund the government through Feb. 8. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate would discuss legal protections for DACA recipients in the following weeks.
Trump’s immigration plan
Trump has proposed an immigration plan, which includes:

	A path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants enrolled in the DACA program.
	$25 billion in funding for a U.S.-Mexican border wall and $5 billion for increased border security.
	Changing or eliminating the diversity visa lottery system.
	Limiting family-based immigration.

Senate negotiations
Earlier on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said a meeting with McConnell went “very well” and that there was “progress on a spending deal.” The Senate leaders said they were working on a two-year budget agreement.
House bill
Separately, the House passed another short-term spending bill Tuesday night, in a 245 to 182 vote. The bill, which would fund the government through March 23, now goes to the Senate.

24362,2018-02-07,House Intelligence Committee votes to release Democrats’ memo,"On Monday evening, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to approve the release of a classified memorandum from Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff. Schiff said the memo responds to points made in the Nunes memo, which was released last Friday and indicated “concerns with legitimacy and legality” in the investigation of a Trump campaign advisor.
As with the Nunes memo, President Donald Trump has five days to decide whether to release the Democrats’ document.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Schiff memo would undergo the same process as the Nunes memo and that it was in the “middle” of a “full and thorough national security review.”

24474,2018-02-08,Trudeau says he ‘shouldn’t make ‘dumb’ jokes after ‘peoplekind’ comment,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday he ""shouldn't be making jokes even when I think they're funny,"" referring to his use of ""peoplekind"" during a town hall meeting in Edmonton last week. At the meeting, a woman from the audience said, ""Maternal love is the love that's going to change the future of mankind."" Trudeau responded by saying, “We like to say ‘peoplekind,’ not necessarily ‘mankind,’ because it’s more inclusive.” The crowd then cheered and the woman laughed, saying, ""There you go, exactly. Yes, thank you."" Some media outlets and social media users criticized Trudeau's comment.
On Wednesday, Trudeau said he made a ""dumb"" joke that ""played well"" at the time, adding that ""out of context, it doesn't play so well."" He said it was a reminder to him that ""I shouldn't be making jokes even when I think they're funny.""
Some media outlets and individuals on social media criticized Trudeau for being ""too politically correct,"" according to The Globe and Mail.
Before the exchange at the meeting, the woman who spoke to Trudeau thanked him for “recently fill[ing] the seats of your cabinet with female leaders.” Trudeau has called himself a “feminist.” He appointed an equal number of men and women to his cabinet, and has nominated a woman to Canada's Supreme Court. 
Trudeau began a four-day visit to the U.S. Wednesday, first visiting the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics, where he spoke about trade.

24484,2018-02-08,US Senate leaders reach two-year budget deal,"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Wednesday that Senate leaders had agreed on a bipartisan two-year budget plan. CNBC reported that about $165 billion would be allocated to the military, and about $131 billion more would go towards domestic programs. The plan would increase debt limits to accommodate an estimated additional $400 billion in spending over two years. The Senate must first vote on the plan by Thursday afternoon or evening; the House would then vote on it before a midnight deadline for a government shutdown.
President Donald Trump tweeted in support of the bill on Wednesday. CNBC said the House Freedom Caucus does not support the spending increases.
The increase in spending would include about $90 billion for disaster aid, such as hurricanes and wildfires, The Washington Post reported. Some of this aid would be allocated to Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. Some of the increased domestic spending would include the following areas: community health centers, an extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program to ten years, opioid abuse, and infrastructure, including transportation, drinking water and broadband internet access. 
The current short-term spending bill expires at midnight Thursday, and a government shutdown would follow unless other legislation is passed. As part of the Senate deal, another short-term spending bill would be passed to fund the government until the two-year budget agreement is finalized and passed. The House passed a separate short-term spending bill on Tuesday.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she and a ""large number"" of Democratic representatives would not support the short-term spending bill unless House Majority Leader Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) assured them that a debate on immigration legislation would take place. 
In September, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program be phased out. The program, which began in 2012 under the Obama administration, grants work permits to approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants — also known as “Dreamers” — who came to the U.S. under the age of 16. Some DACA beneficiaries’ work permits are set to expire on Mar. 5, unless Congress passes legislation or a court order extends the deadline.
As part of the deal to pass the previous short-term spending bill, McConnell told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) that the Senate would debate immigration legislation next week.

24482,2018-02-08,SpaceX launches Falcon Heavy rocket into space,"On Tuesday, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) launched its Falcon Heavy rocket into space from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. According to the company, the rocket has the ability to launch 140,660 pounds (63,800 kg), the equivalent of a loaded Boeing 737 airplane, into ""low Earth orbit.” SpaceX said the rocket is designed to be reusable, making launches about a third of the cost of the next largest payload-carrying rocket, the Delta IV Heavy.
The Falcon Heavy is equipped with three of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket boosters, with nine engines in each booster. Upon takeoff, two-side booster rockets detached from the rocket and landed on launchpads. The rockets had been reused from previous Falcon 9 flights with planned landings. The center booster rocket did not land on a floating platform in the ocean as planned. According to SpaceX, a malfunction led to only one of the center booster’s engines firing during its descent; at least three were required for a successful landing. 
The Falcon Heavy launched carrying a Tesla car belonging to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, with a spacesuit-fitted mannequin in the driver's seat. The car was launched into an orbit around the sun that would take it further away from Earth than Mars. Musk has said he wants to launch a mission to Mars in the next decade.
The company also said it plans to use the Falcon Heavy this year to launch its Dragon spacecraft around the moon with two paying customers on board. Musk said the rocket’s next flight would be in three to six months. SpaceX has planned flights for the the U.S. Air Force and Arabsat, a Saudi Arabian communications company.
SpaceX said the Falcon Heavy cost about $500 million to develop, and it has priced flights at $90 million.
The company added that the only rocket to have had a higher payload capacity was the Saturn V moon rocket, last launched in 1973. The payload capacity of the Falcon Heavy is more than two and a half times that of either the now-retired space shuttle from NASA or the Delta IV Heavy rocket, according to SpaceX. The Delta IV Heavy has been flown by United Launch Alliance since 2002. The Alliance is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Boeing Defense, Space  Security. According to the Alliance, the Delta IV Heavy has flown 35 missions with a 100 percent mission success rate through the end of 2017.

24476,2018-02-08,"Machine learning identifies diabetics with 85% accuracy using wearable heart rate monitors, study says","On Wednesday, App developer Cardiogram announced results of a study that showed 85 percent accuracy in detecting diabetes using smart watches or activity trackers that monitor heart rate and activity. The study took more than 200 million data points from 14,000 Apple Watch and Android Wear users, and put them into a neural network program called DeepHeart. According to Cardiogram, DeepHeart has been used in past studies to detect atrial fibrillation, hypertension and sleep apnea. 
Cardiogram performed the study with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Researchers used some of the available data to ""train"" Cardiogram's DeepHeart program. Once the program was “trained” to detect diabetes, a separate set of data was used to establish the program’s accuracy in identifying which of the participants were diabetics.
In the past, heart beat behavior has been found to correlate with diabetes. A 2015 Framingham Heart Study determined that ""low"" heart rate variability and ""high"" resting heart rate correlated with the development of Type 2 diabetes over a 12-year period. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 100 million U.S. adults have diabetes or prediabetes. The CDC said about 25 percent of  diabetes cases are undiagnosed.

24466,2018-02-08,A brief look at the MS-13 gang,"President Donald Trump held an immigration roundtable discussion on Tuesday about the gang known as MS-13, in which he mentioned the need for more border control legislation. Media articles describe the gang as “violent,” yet many omit specific information about the gang, its origins, what it does and the degree to which the gang is a potential “threat” to U.S. residents.
This context will look at what MS-13 is, its creation, what it does and how the U.S. has responded to it. (The potential reasons for why gangs like MS-13 exist and what social structures may contribute to their development is beyond the scope of this piece.) 
What is MS-13?
MS-13 is a criminal organization with members in various countries, including the U.S. The FBI defines a gang as “an association of three or more individuals” with a collective identity that the groups use to “create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation.”
MS-13 is short for “La Mara Salvatrucha.” “Mara” is the term used for “gang,” and “Salvatrucha” is a combination of the words “Salva” and “trucha.” Salva is an abbreviation for “Salvadoran,” and “trucha” (literally meaning “trout”) is a slang term for “alert,” “look out,” or “cunning.” The “13” refers to the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, or “M,” which denotes the gang’s alleged ties to a prison gang called the Mexican Mafia.
Ioan Grillo, author of “Gangster Warlords,” said the term “Mara” comes from a movie title. A 1950s-era Charlton Heston movie called The Naked Jungle, which was popular in El Salvador, was translated as “Cuando Ruge la Marabunta"" or “When the Ants Roar.” Grillo said Salvadorans took the name “Mara” to refer to a group of friends, who protect each other like ants. The group started in Los Angeles as heavy metal music enthusiasts who called themselves the Mara Stoners. By 1984, the Mara Stoners rebranded as Mara Salvatrucha to incorporate their Salvadoran origins. After several members went to jail in Los Angeles, they aligned themselves with the Mexican Mafia and became MS-13.
When was MS-13 created?
The gang was established in L.A. in the 1980s by El Salvadoran immigrants who fled civil war in their home country. The migrants settled in California in neighborhoods that already had gang activity. Some Salvadoran immigrants eventually joined gangs such as the Barrio 18, started by Mexican immigrants, before establishing MS-13.
What’s the scope of its U.S. operation?
Although official numbers may vary, the DOJ estimates MS-13’s worldwide membership to be about 30,000, with about 10,000 members in the U.S. In addition to Los Angeles, law enforcement officials have noted the gang’s presence in Alaska, Connecticut, Florida, New York, Virginia and the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, among other areas. MS-13 includes members from Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and the U.S. They reportedly recruit minors and other immigrants.
The FBI estimated that the U.S has a total of about 33,000 street, motorcycle and prison gangs with approximately 1.4 million members considered “criminally active.” 
What crimes has MS-13 been associated with?
The crime the FBI attributes to MS-13 members include murder, assault, racketeering, robbery, human trafficking, drug trafficking, prostitution, property damage and weapons smuggling. Below are some of the recent documented examples of MS-13-linked crimes:

	Jan. 2018: A teenaged female MS-13 member is convicted of fatally stabbing another girl in Virginia. 
	Nov. 2017: A MS-13 leader in Massachusetts was convicted of racketeering.
	Aug. 2017: Five suspects allegedly connected to MS-13 were arrested for a 2015 murder of man in Washington. 
	Mar. 2017: At least a dozen members of the MS-13 gang were indicted on seven killings on Long Island spanning three years.
	Feb. 2015: Three MS-13 “members or associates” were arrested for human trafficking in Fairfax County, Virginia.
	Dec. 2014: MS-13 members allegedly wrote “a cop will be killed New Year’s” on the wall of a gas station in Rogers, Arkansas.
	Feb. 2011: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials indicted 11 MS-13 members for murders, stabbings, assaults, robberies and drug distribution.

What actions has law enforcement taken against gangs in general?
In the late 1980s, the Los Angeles police department began “Operation Hammer” to increase law enforcement of suspected gang members. The operation included mass arrests and raids. 
According to The Atlantic, the U.S. began increasing deportations of convicted immigrants in the 1990s, during the Clinton  administration.  Insight Crime estimated that about 20,000 people were sent back to Central America between 2000 and 2004 as part of the deportation initiative.
What actions has law enforcement taken against MS-13?
In 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department designated MS-13 as a “transnational criminal organization” (TCO). The Treasury said MS-13 had been involved in “serious transnational criminal activities, including drug trafficking, kidnapping, human smuggling, sex trafficking, murder, assassinations, racketeering, blackmail, extortion and immigration offenses.” The TCO designation allowed the U.S. to target the gang’s international associates and financial networks. 
In 2016, the Treasury sanctioned two alleged MS-13 leaders: Salvadoran nationals José Roberto Orellana and Dany Balmore Romero García. The sanctions froze all U.S.-based assets controlled by the two men.
A 2017 DOJ memo concluded: “Through the combined efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement, great progress was made diminishing or severely disrupt[ing] the gang within certain targeted areas of the US by 2009 and 2010.” It didn’t provide specifics about what the efforts were. 
The Trump administration has continued to make arrests of alleged MS-13 members. For example, in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security arrested 796 MS-13 “members and associates,” and U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 228 people affiliated with MS-13.

24594,2018-02-09,Trump signs new spending bill; US government ‘shutdown’ ends after a few hours,"U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new spending bill early Friday morning, ending a government “shutdown” that lasted a few hours after the previous temporary funding bill expired at midnight. The House of representative approved the bill around 5:30 a.m. in a 240-to-186 vote. The Senate had voted to approve the bill 71 to 28, with bipartisan support, after 1:00 a.m. Friday. 
The ‘shutdown’
The government had automatically entered a “shutdown,” its second shutdown in two months, after the midnight deadline passed without the Senate approving a spending bill. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ken.) had spoken on the floor multiple times on Thursday and did not agree to move the time for a vote on a budget deal that Senate leaders announced they had reached on Wednesday. By not agreeing to move the time earlier, which required consent from all 100 senators, Paul delayed the vote until 1 a.m. Friday.
House Minority Leader gives 8 hour speech
On Wednesday, the day before the funding deadline, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) held the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives for eight hours and seven minutes. Her address, given in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), set a record for the longest continuous speech in the House chamber. It surpassed a previous record from 1909 of five hours and 15 minutes. Most members of the House have limits on the time they may hold the floor, but the House speaker, the majority leader and the minority leader may speak indefinitely under a special privilege known as the “magic-minute.” 
Pelosi, 77, said she would vote no on the budget deal unless House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) allowed a vote on a plan that would provide protection for DACA recipients, also known as “Dreamers,” who are immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. DACA grants temporary work permits to qualifying applicants. The House had been scheduled to vote on the budget bill at midnight, before the Senate failed to pass it.. 
On Sept. 5, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration was rescinding the DACA program. On Jan. 9, a federal judge ruled that the administration must continue to renew DACA permits while there was a pending lawsuit against the repeal, filed by 15 states. The Justice Department said it would appeal that ruling. On Jan. 24, President Donald Trump announced a plan that would include a path to citizenship for immigrants enrolled in DACA.
Approximately 800,000 “Dreamers” have received work permits and other benefits since 2012.

24597,2018-02-09,Syrian military kills 230 near Damascus; US-led airstrikes kill 100 in Deir al-Zour,"More than 300 deaths have been reported in airstrikes in Syria over the past four days. Syrian military airstrikes killed at least 230 people, including civilians, according to the U.K.-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Elsewhere in Syria, U.S.-led airstrikes killed 100 Syrian government fighters, the Pentagon said. 
The Syrian military airstrikes began in eastern Ghouta, outside Damascus, on Monday. The strikes killed 73 people on Thursday, according to SOHR.
Separately, the U.S.-led air and artillery strikes began overnight Wednesday in Deir al-Zour province. The Pentagon said the strikes were in response to an attack by the Syrian military on the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) headquarters near the town of Khusham. 
The Pentagon said that earlier on Wednesday evening, an estimated 500 Syrian government fighters and heavy artillery had crossed an agreed “demarcation line” along the Euphrates river and had launched an “unprovoked attack” on the SDF headquarters. Syrian forces control the western side of the line, and the SDF controls the eastern side of the line. 
SOHR said the fighters that attacked the SDF headquarters consisted of Afghan Shiite forces and local tribesmen in support of President Bashar Assad. A spokesman for the U.S. coalition said Russia told the coalition that it was not involved in the attack on the SDF headquarters. 
The U.S. said Russian mercenaries were among the casualties in Wednesday’s strikes. Russia said it did not have personnel in the area, and its defense ministry said it only confirmed 25 Syrian militia were wounded, and no deaths. 
The Syrian foreign ministry said it wrote to the U.N., saying the U.S.-led strikes Wednesday night are “a war crime and crime against humanity” and asked for international condemnation of the attacks.
The U.N. had called for a month-long ceasefire in Syria on Tuesday.

The Labor Department also reported that the unemployment rate has been at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent for the last four months. Average hourly earnings rose by 2.9 percent in January compared to a year earlier, and 200,000 more jobs were created last month. In addition, the number of those receiving benefits on an ongoing basis fell by 33,000 to 1,923,000  in the week ending Jan. 27. 
This week, the Dow Jones experienced the largest single-day decline in the index’s history, declining 1,175 points, or 4.6 percent, on Monday.

24604,2018-02-09,Former prime minister of Bangladesh sentenced for corruption,"Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia was jailed on Thursday on corruption charges and sentenced to five years in prison. Zia, the current head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), was convicted of stealing 21 million taka ($253,000) while prime minister from 2001 to 2006. She, along with her son and four aides, were charged with stealing foreign donations received by an orphanage trust she had created. Zia, 72, has denied the charges, and her attorney said she will appeal the verdict.
Demonstrators in the capital city of Dhaka and other cities protested the charges. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in the northeastern city of Sylhet to disperse protesters. Media outlets broadcast images of motorcycles on fire. According to a BNP spokesman, about 3,500 opposition activists and officials were arrested during the protest.
The BNP secretary general said the case was politically motivated, calling it “false and staged.” Human Rights Watch director Brad Adams said the Bangladeshi government is trying to stop political dissent and asked that it cease “arbitrary arrests and detentions.”
Bangladeshi Law Minister Anisul Hug said Zia’s conviction “proves” that “no one is above the law.”
Zia is scheduled to run in parliamentary polls in December. She may still run for office if an appeal is pending at the time, The Guardian reported.

24928,2018-02-12,UK government reviews sexual misconduct claims against charity Oxfam,"Britain’s International Development Minister Penny Mordaunt said on Sunday that she was considering whether charity aid organization Oxfam should continue to receive government funding. Mordaunt’s comment was in response to an article published by the Times on Friday reported that Oxfam mishandled allegations of sexual misconduct by its employees in Haiti. The article reported that Oxfam failed to notify legal authorities after conducting an internal investigation and dismissing certain employees. 
The allegations of sexual misconduct are from 2011, when Oxfam was working in Haiti after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that killed up to 300,000 people. The allegations include a claim that Oxfam’s country director Roland Van Hauwermeiren used prostitutes. The Times investigation report said it could not “be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged.” It alleged there was a “culture of impunity” among some staff in Haiti.
The charity conducted an internal investigation at the time, which led to four people being fired. Three others, including Van Hauwermeiren, resigned. The details of the allegations were not published in the organization’s concluding report, which referred to “serious misconduct.”
Oxfam said in a statement on Friday that its misconduct findings had “related to offences including bullying, harassment, intimidation and failure to protect staff as well as sexual misconduct.” It neither confirmed nor denied specific allegations in The Times’ article. 
Mordaunt said the organization did the “wrong thing” by not reporting the details of the allegations. She said she wrote to British organizations about their efforts to “safeguard” staff and people they work with from harm. She said the ministry expected organizations with “safeguarding issues” to “cooperate fully” with the authorities, and would “cease to fund any organization that does not.” The minister is scheduled to meet with an Oxfam representative about the allegations on Monday.
The charitable organization received £32 million ($44m) from the U.K. government in the last financial year.
Oxfam’s chair of trustees Caroline Thompson said it was introducing new measures to increase vetting and induction of new staff, as well as reporting between aid agencies about people who have been found guilty of sexual misconduct. She added that improvements had already been made since 2011.

Moon has also asked that North Korea resume dialogue with the U.S., the spokesperson said. If the meeting happens, it would be the first between Korean leaders in more than 10 years.
Kim Yo Jong is a member of North Korea’s politburo. She is included on a U.S. list of sanctions related to alleged links to human rights abuses. Kim is the first member of the Kim family to visit South Korea since the 1950-1953 Korean War.
Kim Yong Nam, president of North Korea’s Presidium of the Supreme People’s assembly, also attended the ceremonies. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence attended the opening ceremony as well. Pence's office confirmed that he did not meet with or speak directly to Kim. The vice president also did not attend a dinner hosted by Moon before the ceremony. Pence said the U.S. would continue to apply “maximum sanctions” to the North.
2018 Winter Olympics
The Olympic Games officially began on Friday in Pyeongchang. Last month, in his New Year’s address, Kim Jong Un said he would be willing to send a delegation to the Games. A meeting to discuss the details was held in South Korea on Jan. 9. On Jan. 17, the two countries announced that the delegation would include players for a joint Korean women’s ice hockey team.
North Korea has participated in the Olympics since 1972. It boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

24920,2018-02-12,Russian airliner crashes outside Moscow; 71 presumed dead,"A Russian airplane crashed shortly after takeoff from Moscow’s Domodedovo airport Sunday afternoon. All 65 passengers and six crew members are presumed dead. The cause of the crash is still unknown. 
The Antonov An-148 plane operated by Saratov Airlines was headed for the city of Orsk in the Ural Mountains when it crashed 50 miles southeast of Moscow.
Russia’s Investigative Committee has opened an investigation into the crash and rescue services are working at the site. Russian broadcaster RT reported that one of the flight recorders, the so-called black boxes, has been found. The authorities said all possible causes are being considered, including weather conditions, human error and technical failure.
BBC reported that contact with the plane was lost four minutes after takeoff. The pilot reported a technical malfunction and that he was attempting an emergency landing, according to RT, citing Russian outlet Gazeta.ru. Other outlets refuted the report, and the Associated Press quoted Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko saying: “It has been found out that no reports about technical malfunctions were received from the plane’s crew.” 
The plane was manufactured less than eight years ago, according to Interfax news agency, and the pilot had more than 5,000 hours of flight time, according to Ria-Novosti news agency. Saratov Airlines flies mostly domestic routes in Russia. It also has destinations in Armenia and Georgia.
This was the first crash in the world for a commercial airliner in more than a year.

24883,2018-02-12,"Trump tweets about due process, says lives being ‘destroyed’ by allegations","On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that lives are being “destroyed” by allegations, and he questioned whether there is a lack of “due process.” The tweet did not mention any specific people or allegations.
Trump’s full tweet said, “Peoples (sic) lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?”
This week, two White House aides resigned after allegations of domestic abuse from their ex-wives were made public. While reporting on the tweet, some media outlets related Trump’s tweet to the #MeToo movement and the concern expressed by some that accused men have been judged in the media and punished without due process. Some outlets also mentioned previous allegations of sexual misconduct against the president himself.
About the resignations
White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter resigned on Wednesday. The Washington Post published a restraining order that Porter’s ex-wife Jennifer Willoughby had obtained against him in 2010. A reporter from The Intercept also published photographs showing Porter’s other ex-wife Colbie Holderness with a black eye, which she said was the result of Porter hitting her while they were on vacation in 2003. Porter denied the allegations. 
White House speech writer David Sorensen resigned Friday after his ex-wife Jessica Corbett alleged that he had run over her foot with a car and extinguished a cigarette on her hand while they were married. Their two-and-a-half year marriage began in 2014.  Sorensen has also denied the allegations.
In both cases, the information came to the attention of the FBI while agents were conducting background checks on Porter and Sorensen to issue security clearances for them. The FBI passed on the information to the White House.
On Thursday, Chief of Staff John Kelly sent an email to White House staff saying, “I want you to know that we all take matters of domestic violence very seriously. Domestic violence is abhorrent and has no place in our society.”

25002,2018-02-13,Family of fatally shot man to meet with Canada cabinet members,"The family of Colten Boushie, a 22-year old man who was fatally shot in August 2016, is scheduled to meet with Canadian cabinet members in Ottawa, following the acquittal of Gerald Stanley, 56, who shot Boushie. After the verdict, Boushie’s family members said they “saw no justice.” Rallies protesting the verdict and calling for legal reforms were held in several Canadian cities during the weekend. In Canada, an appeal court cannot overturn a jury acquittal.
On Monday, Boushie’s mother, uncle and cousin reportedly met with two ministers responsible for indigenous affairs, The New York Times reported. Chris Murphy, a lawyer for the family, confirmed they would also meet with Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould on Tuesday. 
Last Friday, a 12-person jury in Battleford, Saskatchewan, found Stanley not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Boushie, who was a member of the Red Pheasant Cree First Nation. According to the prosecution, Boushie and a group of friends pulled into Stanley’s farm due to a flat tire. Stanley said he thought they were trying to steal a vehicle from the farm. The Times reported that evidence at the trial indicated the group had tried to steal a car at another farm, and that a toxicology report indicated a high level of alcohol in Boushie’s system.
Although Canadian law prohibits using a firearm for self-defense or to defend private property, Stanley approached the car armed with a semiautomatic pistol and shot three times. One bullet struck Boushie in the back of the head. Stanley said it was an accidental shooting. In his testimony, he said he thought the gun was not loaded and that it went off. The Times wrote that experts were unable to replicate the mechanical failure.
The Boushie family cited possible irregularities in the investigation, such as that police inspected the victim’s home and surrounding property, and not Stanley’s. They said forensic experts were not brought to the farm, and that two days of rain washed away evidence. 
 
 The family and advocates have also attributed the ruling to an all-white jury, consisting of seven women and five men. Their identities and deliberations are to remain classified under Canadian law. 
The Boushie family said it would ask for the end of peremptory challenges in jury selection, according to The Globe and Mail. Under Canada’s legal system, defense lawyers are allowed to reject up to 14 jury candidates without providing justification. Boushie’s cousin Jade Tootoosis and Murphy said five people who appeared to be indigenous were rejected as part of the jury. 
“We expect to return [...] with a list of commitments from parliamentarians outlining the specific steps the government will take to remedy these injustices,"" Murphy added.

25005,2018-02-13,Trump proposes $4.4 trillion budget to Congress,"On Monday, President Donald Trump proposed a $4.4 trillion budget to Congress for the 2019 fiscal year. 
Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the president must submit a budget outlining his priorities to the Senate. The budget requires 60 votes to pass. Currently, Republican senators hold a majority with 51 seats. The Senate and House Budget Committees must now work on a new proposal that considers Trump’s proposed budget. The final budget would be approved by Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year begins. 
Some of the budget’s proposed allocations and cuts are:

	$716 billion in military programs and for the maintenance of the country’s nuclear arsenal.
	$540 billion in non-defense spending.
	$200 billion for infrastructure over the next decade.
	$85.5 billion in discretionary funding for veteran medical care.
	$23 billion for border security, most of which would fund the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border aimed at stopping illegal immigration.
	$571 million to hire 2,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and agents.
	$13 billion for opioid abuse prevention, treatment, recovery and mental health programs.
	A $2.8 billion (34 percent) budget reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency.
	The budget for the EPA's Office of Science and Technology would be reduced from $762 million to $489 million, the New York Times reported.
	An 4.5 percent increase in U.S. contributions to the U.N.

The White House estimated that the reductions in spending on certain programs will save $600 million in government spending compared to 2017. The budget also estimated an annual gross domestic product growth of at least 3 percent over the next three years.
Note: This Raw Data was corrected to reflect the proposed funding reduction for the EPA's Office of Science and Technology from $762 to $489 million. We had previously reported the proposed reduction as $273 billion.

25008,2018-02-13,"White House says US, Israel did not discuss annexation of West Bank settlements","On Monday, the White House said the U.S. and Israel had not discussed the possible annexation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ""on the subject of applying sovereignty [to West Bank settlements], I can say that I have been talking to the Americans about it for some time.”
After Netanyahu’s claim, White House spokesman Josh Raffel said, “Reports that the United States discussed with Israel an annexation plan for the West Bank are false. The United States and Israel have never discussed such a proposal, and the President's focus remains squarely on his Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative.""
Netanyahu’s spokesman David Keyes said he was not aware that any “concrete proposal had been discussed,” CNN reported.
Israeli communities have been established in the West Bank since Israel’s occupation in 1967. Palestinians and Israelis both claim the West Bank to be their territory. Under Israel’s Sovereignty Law, the country could annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which are currently under the jurisdiction of the Israeli military.
During the Obama administration, the U.N. passed a resolution that considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law.

25011,2018-02-13,Georgia’s former president deported from Ukraine to Poland,"On Monday, Georgia’s former President Mikheil Saakashvili was deported from Ukraine to Poland, after Ukrainian officials captured him while at a restaurant in Kiev.
“This person was on Ukrainian territory illegally and therefore, in compliance with all legal procedures, he was returned to the country from where he arrived,” Ukrainian Border Service spokesman Oleh Slobodyan said in statement. 
Saakashvili’s press secretary claimed that “he was kidnapped by men in camouflage gear in a restaurant near our party offices. They pushed him into a white van and drove off” without showing any identification. 
Saakashvili, 49, was president of Georgia from 2004 to 2007, and from 2008 to 2013. Accused of corruption charges, he moved to the Ukraine, where he lost his Georgian citizenship to become a citizen of Ukraine. In 2015, Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko appointed him governor of the Odessa region. Saakashvili resigned from his position a year later, claiming corruption in the government, and called for Poroshenko’s resignation. The president reportedly revoked Saakashvili’s Ukrainian citizenship in July last year while he was visiting the United States. Saakashvili has remained stateless since.
He later returned to Ukraine, where the government initiated criminal proceedings against him over his illegal entrance. He then requested political asylum, which was rejected last month.
In Georgia, Saakashvili faces criminal charges over illegally pardoning police officers accused of murder, embezzlement and abuses of authority. In Kiev, he was accused of being involved in a plot to “destabilize” Ukraine, The Guardian reported. He has denied the allegations.

25078,2018-02-14,A brief look at Canada-First Nation relations,"Last Friday, a 12-person jury in Battleford, Saskatchewan, found Gerald Stanley not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Colten Boushie, who was a member of the Red Pheasant Cree First Nation. After the verdict, there were rallies and protests for legal reform, with advocates claiming that the court system, and the reported all-white jury, did not provide justice for Boushie. Much of the coverage of these recent developments alluded to the history and complexities between First Nations and the Canadian government. However, they provided little or no specifics to better understand these current issues. Here is a brief explainer on the subject.
Who are the First Nations?
First Nations peoples are the descendants of Canada’s original inhabitants. They are also referred to as “Indigenous” or “Aboriginal” people. According to the government, 901,053 people have registered as First Nations. Canada has 617 First Nations communities. About 52 percent of those who are registered live on reserves.
What’s the history of Canada’s relations with First Nations?
Prior to the 1800s, the First Nations’ role in government under British rule was primarily militaristic and commercial. For example, during the U.S. Revolutionary War, First Nations fought alongside the British (they did so again during the War of 1812). After the war, some First Nations lost land to the U.S. under the Treaty of Versailles; others lost land to new British settlers. As more settlers arrived and Canada’s population grew, more First Nation land was “surrendered” through various land treaties.
Assimilation
Around 1820, the government attempted to assimilate First Nation peoples into British “civilization.” They were encouraged to convert to Christianity. In 1876, the Canadian government enacted the Indian Act, which gave the Department of Indian Affairs the ability to determine who could be considered “Indian.” It allowed the government to manage First Nation lands, resources and currency. The Act also allowed the government to control access to “intoxicants” such as alcohol, and continue to promote Canada’s version of “civilization.” 
Although the Act was amended multiple times, at one point it banned certain religious ceremonies, and in 1927 it was amended to prevent fundraising by First Nations to pursue land claims without government permission. That amendment, as well as restrictions on certain religious ceremonies, was repealed in 1951.
Part of the “assimilation” process involved educating First Nations children in government-funded “residential” schools, which most children attended and resided in for 10 months out of the year. The schools, which existed since 1857, forced the children to forgo their traditional languages, dress, religion and culture. The last of the residential schools closed in 1996. 
Physical and sexual abuse reportedly took place at some of these schools; some of the claims led to convictions. The abuse claims eventually resulted in internal and government inquiries, and in 2007, the government established a $1.9 billion compensation package for those who were forced to attend the schools. In 2008, the government issued a formal apology to all former students of residential schools. According to CBC, $1.6 billion had been paid out to former students as of 2013. 
Representation
In 1960, First Nations were given the right to vote in federal elections. In the early 1970s, First Nations began to form representative organizations to promote their interests nationally. Such organizations also made claims to land. For example, in 1971, when a hydroelectric project was proposed in Quebec, Cree and Inuit successfully argued that they had aboriginal rights to the land.
First Nations also advocated changes to the Indian Act. For example, the Act had stipulated that First Nations women lost their Indian “status” if they married non-Aboriginal men. After groups lobbied to change the law, parliament passed Bill C-31 in 1985, which removed such provisions from the Act.
After a 1990 land claim conflict between Mohawks and land developers resulted in the death of one police officer and led to the involvement of Canadian Armed Forces, the government established the Indian Specific Claims Commission and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP). The commission was created to arbitrate issues between the government, Canadian society and First Nation peoples.
In 1995, the government began negotiating with Indigenous groups to establish systems of self-government. At least 17 self-government agreements between the groups and the federal government have been completed.
In 1996, after about 14 years of lobbying for a holiday to recognize First Nations people, the government designated June 21 as National Aboriginal Day.
First Nations and crime
In a 2006 report, Canada’s Justice Department cited 2004 data indicating that 40 percent of indigenous Canadians reported having been victims of crime the year leading up to the survey, compared to 28 percent of non-indigenous Canadians. The same report noted that indigenous people were three times more likely to have been victims of violent crime compared to the general population (319 incidents versus 101 incidents per 1,000 people). The report goes on to say:

These statistics confirm that Aboriginal people are disproportionately represented as victims of crime in Canada. Perpetrators of violence against Aboriginal people are most often other members of the Aboriginal community such as spouses, relatives, or friends of the victim, and as such, victimization among Aboriginal people in Canada is often regarded as a mirror image of Aboriginal offending.

A 2016 report by Canada’s Office of the Correctional Investigator found that indigenous people constitute less than five percent of Canada’s overall population, and 26.4 percent of its federal prison inmate population. The report noted that for the last three decades, there has been an increase every year in the federal incarceration rate of First Nations peoples. It also said parole grant rates were “much lower for Indigenous than non-Indigenous offenders,” and that Indigenous inmates are more likely to experience segregation and stay imprisoned longer than any other group. For example, if an offender was sentenced to three to six years, he or she may be more likely to serve the full six years.",Context|Law &amp; Justice|Politics,Canada,acquittal|ruling,Colten Boushie|First Nations,,history,world_news,publish
25199,2018-02-14,US intelligence leaders testify before Senate Intelligence Committee,"National intelligence leaders testified before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday during its annual open hearing on ""worldwide threats."" Among those who spoke at the hearing were Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, FBI Director Christopher Wray and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers. The meeting, which lasted approximately two hours and 40 minutes, covered topics including North Korea, Russian interference, cyberattacks, terrorism, economics and energy.
The intelligence community’s “Statement for the Record” can be read here, and a video of the full hearing can be watched here.
Russia
The intelligence directors were asked to confirm if they supported the conclusions of a Jan. 2017 report that concluded with “high confidence” that Russia had attempted to influence the 2016 election. All restated their support.
Coats said, ""There should be no doubt that Russia perceived its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian midterm operations."" His assessment was supported by the other intelligence leaders at the hearing.
North Korea
Pompeo spoke about an analysis his agency completed on what it would take to hold talks with North Korea and how it would react to a possible U.S. military attack. The results of the analysis are classified and were not discussed in the open session.
National debt
Coats said the U.S. national debt of more than $20 trillion is “unsustainable,” and poses a risk “to our economic and national security.”
The Rob Porter case
FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked for information about the allegations of domestic abuse against former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, and when this information was made available to the White House. Wray said the agency delivered an initial report in July of last year and subsequently received a request for further information, which was handed in by November. He said the FBI file on Porter was closed in January this year.

25195,2018-02-14,Israeli police recommend Netanyahu be charged with corruption,"On Tuesday, Israeli police recommended that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two separate cases, known as File 1000 and File 2000. The recommendation will now go to Attorney General Avihai Mendelblit for review, who will decide whether to file charges. Netanyahu can remain in office during the review; he has denied the allegations.
In a televised address Netanyahu said he would remain Israel’s leader as long as its citizens continue to elect him.
File 1000 includes allegations that Netanyahu accepted gifts, such as cigars and champagne, worth about $285,000 in total from Arnon Milchan and James Packer. Milchan is an Israeli Hollywood film producer and Packer is an Australian businessman. Police said in return, Netanyahu allegedly provided assistance with visa matters and suggested legislation that would exempt Israelis returning from abroad from paying taxes for 10 years. The finance ministry eventually rejected this proposal.
File 2000 alleges that Netanyahu asked for positive coverage from an Israeli newspaper in return for supporting legislation that would disadvantage one of its competitors.
Netanyahu, 68, became prime minister in 2009 and previously served in the role between 1996 and 1999.

25186,2018-02-14,ANC formally requests President Zuma’s resignation,"On Tuesday, South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party formally asked President Jacob Zuma to resign. Zuma is not legally required to comply with the request. ANC’s Secretary General Ace Magashule said Zuma had agreed to step down if he could oversee a transition period of three to six months. The ANC leadership did not accept Zuma’s request. If he doesn’t resign, a vote of no confidence has been scheduled in parliament for Feb. 22, which could lead to Zuma’s removal from office.
South Africa’s parliament has previously held votes of no confidence in Zuma. The two most recent ones were held in 2016 and 2017, but did not pass.
Zuma, 75, became president in 2009. In 2016, South Africa’s Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma had violated the constitution by failing to repay government money he spent on renovating his private home. In 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that 18 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering related to a 1999 arms deal should be reinstated. The charges had previously been dropped. Zuma has denied all allegations of corruption.
In December of last year, Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Zuma as leader of the ANC. Zuma’s presidential term expires next year. Only parliament can remove him from office before then.

25299,2018-02-15,US Veterans Affairs Office reports on investigation of Secretary Shulkin’s travel expenses,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on a trip VA Secretary David Shulkin made to Europe last year. The OIG investigated Shulkin’s 11-day trip to Copenhagen and London in July, after an anonymous complaint of misuse of VA funds. The VA Department paid $4,312 for his wife’s airfare; the report said this was the result of Shulkin's chief of staff altering an ""official record” email. The report also cited incidents involving Shulkin accepting Wimbledon tickets, and directing a VA employee to coordinate leisure activities on the trip. Shulkin has denied any wrongdoing.
About the email
According to the OIG report, Shulkin's chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, altered an email she received from a staff member before forwarding it to the VA's ethics office. The email suggested Shulkin would be receiving an award while in the Netherlands. The supposed award was allegedly used to justify the department paying for Shulkin's wife to accompany him as an ""invitational traveler."" Shulkin did not receive an award in the Netherlands.
The OIG concluded that Shulkin did not know about Simpson allegedly altering the email. The office referred Simpson's actions to the Department of Justice (DOJ), saying they ""may have violated federal criminal statutes."" The DOJ decided not to prosecute at that time, according to the OIG report. Simpson responded to the report in a statement on Wednesday, saying, ""I look forward to inserting facts into the record so it may reflect truth and accuracy and illuminate any further confusion or misrepresentation.""
Wimbledon tickets
The IOG report also said Shulkin accepted two tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament from Victoria Gosling. Gosling served as CEO of the 2016 Invictus Games for wounded veterans in Orlando, Florida. Gosling said she spent time there with Shulkin and his wife, Merle Bari, after initially meeting them in 2015. Gosling said she had extra tickets because of a cancellation, and offered them to Shulkin and Bari ""out of friendship."" 
The OIG concluded Shulkin had ""improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets."" Its report said federal ethics rules prohibit the ""acceptance of any gift given because of the employee's official position,"" or if it comes from a ""prohibited source."" The OIG concluded the tickets were offered due to Shulkin’s position in the VA. Shulkin’s lawyers said Gosling offered the tickets due to her “personal relationship” with Shulkin and Bari. 
The OIG also said Shulkin did not seek the advice of the VA ethics counsel before accepting the tickets as a gift. Shulkin's lawyers said Gosling was not a ""prohibited source"" because Gosling does not do business or seek to do business with the VA. 
Use of official staff's time
The OIG concluded that Shulkin directed a VA employee to coordinate Shulkin's leisure time on the European trip, such as tourist activities with his wife, and that it was a ""misuse"" of that employee's official work time. Shulkin's lawyers said the employee started coordinating the leisure time of his own initiative, and later was referred by Shulkin to his wife for further coordination since Shulkin was ""too busy.""
Recommendations and response
The OIG's report made recommendations, including a review and enhancement of employee training on ""travel planning, approvals, and the solicitation or acceptance of gifts."" It also recommended that Shulkin pay for his wife's airfare of $4,312, and for the Wimbledon tickets. Shulkin's office responded that he does not agree with the OIG's conclusions on these two recommendations, and that he will consult with the Office of General Counsel before deciding how to act on them.
Shulkin's attorneys wrote the OIG a 16-page letter in response to a draft of its report. They said the report presented a ""one-sided account"" and omitted ""critical facts"" that ""make clear the Secretary has done nothing wrong."" 
The OIG report said that in Copenhagen, Shulkin had meetings related to veterans’ health issues and the Danish healthcare system. In England, Shulkin attended a London Summit in which mental health issues of veterans were discussed. The entire trip cost the government at least $122,334, according to the OIG.

File 1000 includes allegations that Netanyahu accepted gifts, such as cigars and champagne, worth about $285,000 in total from Arnon Milchan and James Packer. Milchan is an Israeli Hollywood film producer and Packer is an Australian businessman. Police said in return, Netanyahu allegedly provided assistance with visa matters and suggested legislation that would exempt Israelis returning from abroad from paying taxes for 10 years. The finance ministry eventually rejected this proposal.
File 2000 alleges that Netanyahu asked for positive coverage from an Israeli newspaper in return for supporting legislation that would disadvantage one of its competitors.
Netanyahu, 68, became prime minister in 2009 and previously served in the role between 1996 and 1999.

25375,2018-02-16,Trump addresses the public after shooting at Florida school,"President Donald Trump responded to Wednesday’s shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 students and teachers, saying that the nation is “praying for the victims and their families.” Speaking from the White House on Thursday, Trump told “America’s children, especially those who feel lost, alone, confused or even scared” that they “are never alone” and “have people who care about” them. 
Trump said America must “work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life, that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.” 
The president added that his administration was “committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” He announced he would meet with the nation’s governors and attorney generals, and the “top priority” of the meeting would be “making our schools and our children safer.” He did not elaborate on any specific measures or policies the administration would consider. 
Prior to his speech, Trump tweeted: “So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!”
The shooting
Police identified Nikolas Cruz, 19, as the suspect who fatally shot 17 people and injured 14 more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He had been a student until he was “recently” expelled. The county sheriff said Cruz was armed with a AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and multiple magazines.
Cruz was charged on Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, one for each person killed. He is being held without bail at a local jail, and was placed on suicide watch, according to the county’s chief assistant public defender Gordon Weekes.
The New York Times reported that the AR-15 used in the attack had been purchased legally. Peter Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami, said, “no laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon.” 
Florida Senator Bill Nelson said the FBI also indicated the shooter wore a gas mask and carried smoke grenades. On the Senate floor on Thursday, Nelson said, “let’s talk about that 19-year-old carrying an AR-15.” He called for better “background checks.”

25379,2018-02-16,US Senate votes against four immigration proposals,"The U.S. Senate voted against four immigration proposals on Thursday afternoon. The votes followed a week of negotiations on four immigration issues: citizenship for undocumented immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, funding for a U.S.-Mexican border wall and security, the diversity visa lottery system, and family-based immigration. An immigration proposal must receive 60 votes to pass in the Senate and a majority of support in the House before being signed into law by the president.
The first bill that the Senate voted on failed to advance after a 52-47 vote in favor of the measure. The bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), proposed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients and funding for border security, but not for a border wall. It would not end the diversity lottery program or the family-based migration program. 
Next, the senate voted 54-45 in support of a proposal to restrict funding for so called “sanctuary cities,” introduced by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.). This legislation would require that state and local law enforcement officials cooperate with federal immigration officials, or the cities could risk losing certain federal funding.
Third, a bill sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D.-N.Y.), failed to pass in a 54-45 vote. Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Angus King (I-Maine) had also introduced the bill, CBS News reported. The bill would have given protection to DACA recipients, such as granting qualified recipients conditional, lawful permanent residence. It also called for $25 billion in funding for border security. 
The final bill the Senate voted on, introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), failed to pass in a 39 to 60 vote. That bill, endorsed by President Donald Trump, proposed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, $25 billion for border security, an end to the diversity visa lottery system and an end to sponsoring extended family members for immigration to the U.S.

25382,2018-02-16,Ethiopian prime minister resigns,"Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced on Thursday he would step down, citing ongoing “unrest and political crisis” in the country. He said he would also resign as the chairman of the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). 
“Unrest and political crisis have led to the loss of lives and displacement of many,” Hailemariam said in a televised address. “I see my resignation as vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy.” Protests since 2015 have led to hundreds of deaths.
Hailemariam, 52, is a former university dean and has been prime minister since 2012. He said he would temporarily fill the role of caretaker until Parliament named a new prime minister and EPRDF chair. The coalition, which controls every seat in Ethiopia’s 547-member parliament, accepted the prime minister’s resignation and is scheduled to hold a session next month.
Protests and state of emergency
In 2015, demonstrators in Ethiopia’s two largest regions, Oromia and Amhara, began protesting a government-backed urban development plan in the capital city of Addis Ababa. 
The government planned to develop farmland belonging to the Oromos, Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, in order to expand the capital region. The Oromos make up about a third of Ethiopia’s population of 100 million, and there have been no Oromo representatives in Ethiopia’s current or past government leadership, CNN reported. 
The government later ended it’s plan to expand the capital, but protests continued. Demonstrators called for political and economic reforms, and for the end of alleged state corruption.
In October 2016, the government implemented a six-month state of emergency, which was later extended to 10 months, after hundreds of people died during ongoing demonstrations. The United Nations has criticized Ethiopian authorities’ alleged use of lethal force against protestors. 
Political reforms 
In January of this year, the Ethiopian government announced it would release political prisoners, including opposition figures and journalists detained for involvement in mass protests. Since then, more than 6,000 prisoners have been released. 
Since Monday, protesters in three regions of the country have demonstrated, demanding the release of all political prisoners, BBC reported.

25385,2018-02-16,Cyril Ramaphosa elected president of South Africa,"Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as South Africa’s president on Thursday in a parliamentary vote, after Jacob Zuma resigned from the presidency the day before. In his address to the nation, Ramaphosa, 65, said his intent was to “continue to improve the lives of our people.” He was sworn in as president later on Thursday.
Ramaphosa, a former union leader and business executive, replaced Zuma as leader of the African National Congress (ANC) in December. Zuma’s presidential term was scheduled to expire next year, but the ANC requested Zuma’s resignation on Tuesday.
In 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal reinstated charges against Zuma that were previously dropped. Zuma, who became president in 2009, denies the allegations of 18 counts of corruption, which include fraud, racketeering and money laundering. Parliament had scheduled a vote of no confidence for Feb. 22 if Zuma did not resign. Protesters had called for his resignation.

25462,2018-02-17,"Mueller investigation indicts 13 Russian nationals, 3 entities for alleged US election interference","Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Department of Justice announced on Friday. 
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said, “The defendants allegedly conducted what they called information warfare against the United States, with the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.” 
The Russians were charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Three were also charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five were charged with aggravated identity theft. 
Mueller has convened a grand jury as part of his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election and whether any members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. 
Rodenstein said the indictment did not allege that any American was a “knowing participant” in illegal activity, or that the actions “altered the outcome of the 2016 election.” He repeated that the investigation is ongoing. 
The White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump had been “fully briefed” on the matter. It said the indictment “indicates” there was “no collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia, given that the charges allege an interference “strategy” began in 2014, before Trump declared his candidacy.
What the indictment alleges
The indictment names Russian organization Internet Research Agency LLC, along with its employees, as a defendant, claiming that as early as May 2014 it began a strategy to interfere with the election. The company’s stated goal was to “spread distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,” according to the indictment.
The charge alleges that defendants created false American personas, social media accounts and groups. They are accused of spreading “derogatory information” about candidates, as well as organizing rallies for or against candidates. 
The indictment refers to a memo the Internet Research Agency sent its staff in February 2016 about posting content to U.S. social media sites, instructing them to ""use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump — we support them).” At the time, Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders were competing in the Democratic primaries. 
The indictment also alleges that one of the false personas contacted an “unwitting” Trump campaign official to request “assistance” in rally locations. It does not indicate whether the campaign official responded. 
The Russian nationals are accused of organized competing rallies, including two in New York on Nov. 12: a “Trump is NOT my President” rally and a “show your support for President-elect Donald Trump"" rally.
The indictment further alleges that employees of the Internet Research Agency committed identity theft to obtain PayPal accounts that were used to purchase advertisements on social media sites, and to pay for expenses including buttons, banners and flags at the rallies.
Russian Foreign Ministry reponse
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova questioned the indictment on a Facebook post. “13 people intervened in the elections in the US? 13 against billion-dollar budgets of special services? Against intelligence and counterespionage, against the newest technologies? Absurd? – Yes. ”

25541,2018-02-19,Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 2 after bomb wounds 4 Israeli soldiers,"Israel’s army carried out 18 strikes on targets in the Gaza strip overnight between Saturday and Sunday, killing two Palestinians. The strikes came as a response to a bomb that injured four Israeli soldiers east of the town of Khan Younis in the Gaza strip on Saturday afternoon. The strikes were carried out by planes and tanks.
The Israeli army said the 18 targets it hit were all linked to Hamas. The sites included “weapons manufacturing infrastructure,” two observation posts and a tunnel being dug by militants, according to the army. Hamas has controlled the Gaza strip since a disputed election in 2006 led to an armed conflict the following year. Israel and Hamas has fought three wars since then.
No person or group has claimed responsibility for the initial bomb on Saturday. The Israeli army said the explosive was attached to a flag during a demonstration on Friday. It exploded when the soldiers attempted to remove the flag, according to the army. 
Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the bomb had been detonated by the Popular Resistance Committees, a smaller Palestinian resistance group.

25547,2018-02-19,Iranian airliner crashes; 65 presumed dead,"A commercial airliner with 65 people on board crashed in the Mount Dena region of central Iran on Sunday. Everyone on board is presumed dead, including 59 passengers and six crew members, according to a spokesperson for the carrier, Aseman Airlines. The cause of the crash is unknown. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has asked the transport minister to carry out an investigation into the crash.
The Aseman Airlines ATR-72 twin turboprop plane was on its way from Mehrabad airport in Iran’s capital city of Tehran to the city of Yasuj, located 485 miles (780 km) to the south. The control tower was last in contact with the plane 14 miles (22.5 km) from the airport where it was due to land, according to Iranian state TV. The channel also reported that the weather in the area was foggy, windy and snowy at the time of the crash. An Aseman Airlines spokesperson confirmed that the airline had been unable to reach the presumed crash site to confirm whether all on board had died.
Aseman Airlines operates mainly domestic routes in Iran, but also runs international routes. The company is banned from flying in the European Union due to “safety concerns,” the Associated Press reported.
The crashed plane was 25 years old, according to Iranian officials. Aseman Airlines posted about the plane on Instagram in October of last year, saying that after being grounded for seven years, it was being repaired, tested and reinstated.
International sanctions relating to Iran’s nuclear program have prohibited the supply, sale or transfer of airplane parts to Iranian companies since at least 2008. After the 2015 nuclear agreement lifting some of these sanctions, Iran has regained access to the international market for airplanes and parts.

25749,2018-02-21,Lawyer connected to former Trump adviser pleads guilty to false statements in Mueller investigation,"Prosecutors for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation have charged lawyer Alex van der Zwaan with lying to investigators about his communication with former Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates. Van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to the charges, which do not involve alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Van der Zwaan was accused of making the false statements during an interview with investigators regarding work he did in 2012 for the Ukrainian government, according to court documents.
Gates, along with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, were indicted by Mueller in October on charges related to political consulting they did in the Ukraine. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment cited a 2012 report that was produced for the Ukrainian government by van der Zwaan’s firm. According to Ukrainian court documents, Manafort worked to set up the contract between Ukraine and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP. In November, prosecutors questioned van der Zwaan about the 2012 report. It was during this interview that van der Zwaan allegedly lied about his communication with Gates.
Mueller on Tuesday released a two-page indictment which said van der Zwaan told the FBI his last contact with Gates was in Aug. 2016, and that his last communication with an unidentified “Person A” was in 2014. The FBI alleges van der Zwaan’s last contact with both people was in Sep. 2016. Van der Zwaan also allegedly told the FBI he didn't know why an email he had written to ""Person A"" in Sep. 2016 had not been passed to Mueller's office. The indictment said van der Zwaan “deleted and otherwise did not produce emails sought by” Mueller's office, including the email with ""Person A.""
Van der Zwaan’s sentencing is scheduled for April 3. Sentencing could include prison time of up to six months and a fine as high as $9,500. His former law firm said on Tuesday it had fired van der Zwaan last year and is cooperating with authorities.
Van der Zwaan is a Dutch national and is the son-in-law of Russian billionaire German Khan.

25756,2018-02-21,US proposes rule to extend short-term health care limit to 12 months,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on Tuesday it was proposing a rule to extend the maximum length of short-term health coverage to 12 months, an increase from the current three months. The rule, which has not been finalized, was in response to a 2017 executive order by President Donald Trump and was proposed jointly with the Labor and Treasury Departments.
Trump's Executive Order 13813 directed the HHS, Labor and Treasury Departments to propose regulations to increase the maximum duration of short-term health insurance. Such insurance could cost less than insurance obtained under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Short-term health care plans don’t have to offer comprehensive coverage and would come with a disclaimer that they don’t meet the ACA's consumer protection requirements, such as guaranteed coverage.
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said it would accept comments on the proposed rule for 60 days.

CNN reported the trip was to sell “luxury condos,” and added that he was scheduled to meet with buyers in at least two different cities.
""I don't want to be glib but you can see the poorest of the poor [in India] and there is still a smile on a face,"" he said during an interview with TV channel CNBC-TV18. “It is a different spirit than that which you see in other parts of the world, and I think there is something unique about that.” 
Referring to India’s residents, Trump Jr. also said, “there’s that spirit that really shines through, and I think that speaks to the future potential of what this country can do.”
Trump Jr. is scheduled to deliver a foreign policy speech alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. The eldest son of President Donald Trump, Trump Jr. is not officially part of his father’s administration.
A 2016 World Bank report said India is “by far the country with the largest number of people living under the international US$1.90-aday poverty line, 224 million.” The report is based on 2013 data.
Media reactions
When reporting the story in its WorldViews foreign news blog, The Washington Post published the headline, “Donald Trump Jr. says he likes India’s poor people because they ‘smile.’” Fox News later published an article alleging the Post attempted to “smear” Trump Jr. with the “misleading” headline and to portray him as a “xenophobic villain.” The Post’s opinion piece did not refer to Trump Jr. as such.
The Post reportedly changed its headline. As of Wednesday, it read, ""Donald Trump Jr. says he admires India’s poor people because of their spirit and smiles.""

25809,2018-02-22,Israel’s former communications director to testify in corruption investigation,"On Tuesday, Israel’s former Communications Ministry Director General Shlomo Filber agreed to serve as a government witness in a corruption investigation, according to Israeli media. Filber will testify in a case involving Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq, known as Case 4000.
Police are investigating whether the ministry illegally provided classified information to Bezeq executives, and whether the same executives illegally received $48 million in funds intended for Shaul Elovitch, Bezeq’s controlling shareholder. Seven people in total, including Filber, have been arrested on charges of bribery, fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice in connection with the case. All have denied the allegations.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was communications minister during the period when the illegal transactions allegedly took place. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu allegedly received favorable media coverage from a Bezeq website known as Walla, in return for the classified information. He has not been named a suspect in Case 4000.
Last week, Israeli police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two other cases known as Case 1000 and Case 2000. The Attorney General is to decide whether Netanyahu will be charged in those cases. The Attorney General’s office declined to comment on Case 4000.

25812,2018-02-22,"SCOTUS votes 9-0 to reverse, remand case to broaden ‘whistleblower’ protections","On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously to reverse and remand a case that would broaden corporate “whistleblower” protections. The case, Digital Realty v. Somers, argued that whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation (such as dismissal or demotion) from employers whose misconduct they seek to expose in cases in which they have not report alleged violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In the decision, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the anti-retaliation protections for whistleblowers in the 2010 Dodd-Frank bill only apply to those who have reported alleged wrongdoings to the SEC. Quoting a Senate report, she said the purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions was to “motivate people who know of securities law violations to tell the SEC.”
The lawsuit was filed by Paul Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, who was fired after he filed an internal complaint against his supervisor, alleging violations of federal securities laws. Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Somers, who argued that whistleblowers should be protected even if they do not report to the SEC. Digital Realty appealed that ruling.
The SEC received over 4,200 reports of alleged misconduct in 2016, according to Bloomberg.
Note: This article was corrected to state that the Supreme Court voted to reverse and remand. A previous version of the article stated the court declined to hear the case.

He was convicted under laws that prohibit “insulting a foreign country” and “insulting national institutions,” according to The Guardian. Bahrain’s government said Rajab’s convictions “did not, in any way, relate to any political views he may hold.”
Al Jazeera reported that one of the tweets was posted on Mar. 26, 2015, the day Saudi Arabia entered into the Yemen conflict. The tweet said that wars ""bring hatred, destruction and horrors.”
Rajab, 53, is currently serving a two-year sentence for giving an interview in which he criticized Bahrain. At that sentencing, the court stated the sentence was for ""spreading rumors and untruthful information"" against the government. Rajab has spent some of his incarceration in the hospital due to heart problems and ulcers.

25921,2018-02-23,"Trump calls for raising gun buyers’ age to 21, says ‘adept’ teachers should have guns in schools","U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that he would be “strongly pushing” Congress on “comprehensive background checks,” increasing the minimum age to purchase guns to 21, and ending the sale of bump stocks. He also said on Thursday that he thinks that if “adept” teachers with weapons training carried concealed guns in school, they would “solve the problem” of shootings at school “before police arrive.” The previous day, Trump met with some parents and students of the high school in Florida where a shooting killed 17 people and injured 14 others last week.
The president tweeted: “I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!” 
Earlier this week, Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations that would ban “bump fire stocks and similar devices.” Bump fire stocks are devices that allow semi-automatic guns to fire faster.
Trump also met with law enforcement and school officials from across the country at the White House on Thursday. At the meeting he recommended having some teachers carry concealed weapons and to “give them a bonus” as an incentive. He said, “you can’t hire enough security guards” to protect schools, and argued that teachers with concealed weapons would deter shooters from entering schools. 
Trump addressed the public after the Feb. 14 shooting, saying at the time that his administration was “committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.”  
White House spokesman Raj Shah said Trump has not decided whether to request a gun control bill for Congress to consider, or allow members of Congress to draft their own measure.
On Wednesday, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he’d support a proposal to raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons, such as AR-15s, from 18 to 21. He opposed the idea of teachers carrying weapons. 
The National Rifle Association (NRA) responded on Wednesday to the proposal to raise the minimum age to purchase guns, saying this would limit people’s “constitutional right to self-protection.” At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, NRA CEO Wayne La Pierre opposed “more restrictions on the law-abiding.” He argued that “to stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.”

25924,2018-02-23,Nigeria apologizes after army incorrectly says military rescues 76 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram (Update),"Nigerian Minister of Information Alhaji Lai Mohammed told reporters on Friday that local officials had mistakenly said that the army rescued 76 schoolgirls on Wednesday who are suspected to have been abducted by the Boko Haram militant group. The minister said the girls remain unaccounted for and apologized. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari called the situation a “national disaster” on Friday. 
Boko Haram members had taken the girls from the Government Girls Science Technical School in the town of Dapchi, Yobe state, on Monday, after firing guns and setting off explosives. Witnesses told reporters the abducted girls had been taken away in trucks. There are inconsistent reports of the number of girls missing.
The president said in a statement on Friday, “We are sorry that this could have happened. We pray that our gallant armed forces will locate and safely return your missing family members.”
The state government had incorrectly said some of the girls had been rescued from the “terrorists who abducted them,” and were now with the Nigerian army. The Yobe police commissioner told reporters on Tuesday that Boko Haram had also abducted three people from the nearby town of Gaidam.
Dapchi is about 170 miles (275 km) northwest of Chibok, the town where Boko Haram kidnapped more than 270 girls in 2014. About 60 of those girls escaped the group shortly after, and others have since been released in exchange for money or for the release of imprisoned Boko Haram members. About 100 of the girls who were kidnapped then are believed to still be in captivity.
Boko Haram’s insurgency campaign has displaced an estimated 2.4 million people in the region since 2013, according to the United Nations. Reuters reports that 20,000 people have been killed by the group. 

Note: We initially reported on the local officials’ statement that 76 girls had been rescued. This article has been updated to reflect the Minister of Information’s statement to the contrary.

25927,2018-02-23,UN Security Council debates Syria ceasefire resolution; Russia proposes amendments,"The United Nations Security Council continued to debate a draft resolution for a temporary ceasefire in the Syrian conflict, and the Russian ambassador to the U.N. announced an agreement had not been reached. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia presented new amendments to a draft resolution that calls for a ceasefire and the delivery of medical and humanitarian aid in Syria. He said the Security Council needs a “feasible” agreement, questioning how it would be enforced and whether the aid operation could reach civilians. Russia holds veto power on the council.
Russia proposed the amendments after two weeks of negotiations on a draft resolution presented by Sweden and Kuwait, which began on Feb. 9. That draft calls for a 30-day ceasefire to take effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. After another 48 hours, aid deliveries and medical evacuations would start.
Last week, Russia negotiated an amendment that specified the ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, which would allow the Syrian government to continue to fight against the groups. Russia provides support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government. 
The Swedish ambassador to the U.N., Olof Skoog, said the council was “leaning towards” holding a vote on the resolution on Friday. The U.S., U.K. and France have said they support the resolution. Nebenzia said Skoog was calling for a vote “fully aware there is no agreement on it.”
Speaking at the U.N. in New York on Thursday, the Russian ambassador said, “what we need is not symbolism, not decisions for the sake of decisions, but rather measures that are undertaken that are commensurate with conditions on the ground.” Nebenzia also said that supporters of the ceasefire were creating a “scandal in order to step up pressure on the Syrian government and taint the Russian government.” 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group, said at least 403 people have been killed in Syria since Sunday. The draft resolution says that 5.6 million people are in ""acute need"" of aid. During the almost 8 year war, an estimated 340,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced.

25930,2018-02-23,Canadian PM Trudeau visits India,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in India for a weeklong state visit. Visiting with his wife and three children, he has announced investment deals, attended a business forum and toured landmarks. He is scheduled to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Friday. Trudeau also rescinded an invitation that had previously been extended to meet with a member of a group that is prohibited in India. 
On Tuesday in Mumbai, Trudeau announced more than $1 billion in investment agreements between Canadian and Indian businesses. The prime minister’s office said the deals would lead to the creation of more than 5,800 “good, well-paying middle class jobs for Canadians.” The office did not provide details about the agreements. Trudeau also participated with a women’s leadership roundtable, joined a discussion at the Canada-India Business Forum, and met with Bollywood actors on Tuesday.
The Canadian leader was initially scheduled to attend a reception with Jaspal Atwal, who was convicted of attempted murder in 1986 for trying to kill an Indian politician visiting Canada. The Canadian delegation rescinded the invitation when it learned who Atwal was and that he’s a member of a banned separatist group, Reuters reported. Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that the member of parliament who included Atwal on a list of invitees assumed “full responsibility” for his actions. 
Politicians and people on social media criticized Trudeau’s and his family’s decision to dress in traditional Indian apparel on multiple occasions, including an outfit traditionally worn by grooms at weddings. Indian opposition politician Omar Abdullah tweeted, “FYI we Indians don’t dress like this every day sir, not even in Bollywood.”
Canadian-Indian ties
Last year, Canadian merchandise exports to India totaled $4.18 billion, and imports from India were $4.16 billion.
There are about 1.4 million people in Canada with Indian heritage, out of the country’s total population of about 35.2 million. Indians were the second-largest group of immigrants arriving in Canada in 2016.

25994,2018-02-24,"Mueller investigation files new charges against Gates, Manafort; Gates pleads guilty to 2 charges","Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed new charges against former Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. The 32 charges, which were released on Thursday, include filing false tax returns, failure to report on foreign accounts, and bank fraud. Gates pleaded guilty on Friday afternoon to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges in Washington.
These charges are part of Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and “related matters.”
The 37-page indictment alleges that Manafort, with the help of Gates, “laundered” more than $30 million, concealing it from the Treasury and Justice Departments. The document alleges more than $75 million was channeled through offshore accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Seychelles. The charge of bank fraud can carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison and a fine of as much as $1 million.
This week’s indictment adds to the 12 charges that Mueller’s investigation already filed against Manafort and Gates in October of last year. Those charges were filed in the District of Columbia. The new charges were filed in the Eastern District of Virginia. Mueller’s investigators reportedly told Manafort and Gates that they could defend the new charges in Washington, and, according to CNN, Manafort declined. 
Manafort and Gates allegedly acted as “unregistered agents” of foreign governments and political parties, specifically the government of then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, according to the previous charges against the two men. The indictment alleges that they did not pay taxes on “tens of millions” of dollars earned from the Ukraine work. 
Manafort pleaded not guilty to the charges from last October. Gates initially pleaded not guilty last year. Then on Friday, Gates signed a plea deal that admitted to two charges: conspiracy against the United States, relating to seven counts from the October indictment on conspiring to obstruct the Justice and Treasury departments, and the charge of “false statement,” for making willful misrepresentations to the FBI. The deal said he would “cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly” with the special counsel’s office.
Manafort has not entered a plea for the new charges. His lawyer released a statement saying he is innocent and “confident that he will be acquitted of all charges.” After Gates’ plea, Manafort said it “does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.”
Manafort filed a lawsuit in January against Mueller alleging the investigation “exceeded the scope” of its authority, as the charges brought against Manafort and Gates relate to work from before joining the Trump campaign.

26130,2018-02-26,The Facts: House Intel Committee Democrats release memo,"Democrats from the House Intelligence Committee publicly released a partially redacted memorandum on Saturday that aimed to “correct the record” after committee Republicans released a memorandum earlier this month. The Democratic document concluded the Department of Justice (DOJ) “did not ‘abuse’” the process to obtain a surveillance warrant on a former adviser to the Trump campaign, Carter Page, and that it did not omit “material information.” On the same day, committee Republicans released a “refutation” of the Democrats’ memo. 
Democrats on the committee drafted the memo as a response to one released on Feb. 2 by Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). The Nunes memo said there were “concerns with legitimacy and legality” in DOJ and FBI efforts to obtain a warrant to surveil Page in October 2016. The application for that warrant was made through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and there were three subsequent renewals every 90 days. Page has not been indicted or charged as part of the investigation.
The Democratic memo concluded that the DOJ met the “rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA’s probable cause requirement.” It also called the GOP memo a “move to undermine” the FBI and DOJ that risked “public exposure of sensitive sources and methods for no legitimate purpose.” (More details below.)
Timeline 

	Jan. 29, 2017: The House committee votes to declassify and release the Nunes memo, giving the president five days to determine whether the release would be a “threat to the national interest.” The committee votes to release a Democrat counter-memo to the full House, but not to the public.
	Feb. 2: The Nunes memo is released (read that Raw Data here), with the approval of President Trump. On the same day, the FBI releases a statement that it had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy.” House committee Democrats release a response that calls the GOP memo an “effort to discredit” the DOJ and FBI, and “undermine” the ongoing investigation.
	Feb. 5: The House committee votes to release the Democrats’ counter-memo, sending it to Trump for review.
	Feb. 9: Trump blocks the release of the Democratic memo in its current form. A letter from his lawyer says that given “numerous classified and especially sensitive passages,” Trump cannot release the memo. It says “given the public interest in transparency,” Trump directed DOJ personnel to “be available” if the committee wanted to revise the memo to “mitigate the risks identified” by the DOJ.
	Feb. 24: The Democratic memo is released. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), says it’s “the product of a good faith negotiation between the Minority and the FBI and DOJ.” On the same day, Nunes releases a statement calling the memo an “unpersuasive attempt to distract from the Committee’s key findings on FISA abuse.” The committee Republicans also release a “point by point refutation” of the Democrats’ memo.

The Democratic memo and Republican response
Role of the ‘dossier’
The Democratic memo said the DOJ met the evidentiary basis for the FISA warrant against Page due to: “contemporaneous evidence of Russia’s election interference,” “Russian links and outreach to Trump campaign officials,” Page’s history with Russian intelligence, and another redacted claim. It also said “FISA was not used to spy on Trump or his campaign,” given Page had left the campaign “months before” the warrant application.
The memo alleged that a report, or “dossier,” compiled by former-British intelligence agent Christopher Steele “did not inform” and “played no role” in the FBI’s decision to investigate “Russian interference and links to the Trump campaign.” Steele had worked as an FBI source on other previous cases.  
That Steele report had been funded by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign as opposition research on then-presidential candidate Trump. The Democratic memo said the dossier didn’t “inform” the decision to investigate; the FBI did not receive it until mid-September 2016, and the investigation began in July of that year. The Democratic memo says “the FBI would have continued” the investigation “even if” it did not receive the Steele report or if the FISA warrant for Page had been rejected.
The Republican rebuttal alleges that “once underway, the investigation was fueled by Christopher Steele’s dossier.” It further states that the “DOJ and FBI’s reliance on the DNC- and Clinton-campaign funded dossier in court filings, not the overall investigation, is the focus of the GOP memo.”
‘Independent’ probable cause
The Democratic memo says the DOJ had an “independent basis” for looking into Page, including work he did with Russian state-owned companies while living in Moscow for three years, and that Russian spies allegedly tried to recruit Page. The memo says that only a “specific sub-section” of the FISA warrant mentions the Steele report, regarding his alleged visit to Russia in March 2016 while a member of the Trump campaign. The document also says it was “consistent with the FBI’s assessment of Russian intelligence efforts to recruit” Page.
The Republican response said “the Steele dossier was the FBI’s only source for the allegations in the initial application that Page met with particular Russians in July 2016.” It also stated that the Democratic memo “fails to explain why” if there was enough evidence on Page, the Steele dossier was cited in the warrant application, and why the DOJ did not apply for the warrant until after getting the dossier. Republicans also said that senators confirmed the Steele dossier was a “significant portion” of the FISA application.
Disclosure of Steele’s political motivations
The original Republican memo had alleged that the FBI did not disclose in the FISA warrant or renewal applications that Steele’s report was financed by the DNC with a political agenda. The Democratic memo says the FBI did disclose to the judges approving the FISA warrants “the assessed political motivation of those who hired” Steele, while still “appropriately” upholding the practice of protecting a U.S. citizen’s information. It says the DOJ revealed to the court that the FBI speculates “the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s campaign.” The candidate refers to Trump, and the “identified U.S. person” refers to the person who hired Steele.
The Republican rebuttal alleges that none of the Page FISA applications “disclose or reference” the role of the DNC and Clinton campaign, and “instead, the FISA application relies on a convoluted statement buried in a footnote.” 
Notification of Steele’s dismissal
The Democratic memo says the FBI “properly notified” the court after terminating Steele, adding that the Republican memo cited “no evidence” that the FBI “actually knew or should have known” about Steele’s disclosures to the media before the bureau made the initial warrant application. 
The Republican response alleges the DOJ told the court four times (at the initial application and three renewals) an “incorrect assessment that Steele had not been a source for an earlier, September 2016 Yahoo News” article, adding that the reporter “publicly confirmed that Steele was a source.” It says the FBI’s “reliance on Steele’s credibility was badly misplaced” given his disclosures to the media. 
Strzok and Page
The Democratic memo alleged the GOP memo “gratuitously” mentioned intelligence agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page (no relation to Carter Page) to “imply that political bias infected the FBI’s investigation and DOJ’s FISA applications.” Strzok and Page both left Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation after texts they sent each other had included pro-Clinton and anti-Trump messages. The Democratic memo says neither “served as affiants on the applications, which were the product of extensive and senior DOJ and FBI review.”
The Republican response asserted that “given the small size of the team, the apparent bias of the investigators displayed in Strzok-Page text messages is highly relevant to an analysis of the investigation.”
The Democratic memo and Republican response address other claims of what the Democratic memo calls “omissions, errors and distortions,” including the citing of a 2016 Yahoo News article in a FISA application and more.

26219,2018-02-27,Chinese Communist Party proposes removing presidential term limits,"On Sunday, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) announced it had proposed amendments to China's Constitution, including a proposal that would allow the president and vice president to stay in power beyond the current limit of two consecutive five-year terms. If approved, the change would allow incumbent President Xi Jinping to remain in office past 2023, when his second term ends.
The CCP made the announcement on Sunday via the state-run news agency Xinhua. Here is the full announcement as it appeared on Xinhua’s English-language site the day of the announcement.

-- Chinese President and Vice-President
The [CCP] Central Committee proposed revising the clause “The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the People’s Republic of China is the same as that of the National People’s Congress, and they shall serve no more than two consecutive terms” to “The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the People’s Republic of China is the same as that of the National People’s Congress.”

The CCP parliament is scheduled to vote on this and other proposed constitutional amendments on Mar. 5 during the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress. The congress is made up entirely of members who support the CCP. Parliament would also vote then to formally confirm Xi to his second five-year term as president. 
Xi, 64, is also general secretary of the CCP and commander in chief of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). He is the son of a founding member of the CCP and joined the party in 1974.
Other CCP proposals
Among other proposed changes to China’s constitution are:

	Adding the policy guideline “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,” which provides a 14-point theory for upholding and developing socialism.
	Adding the policy guideline, “The Scientific Outlook on Development,” which provides a theory for economic and social development.
	Adding a clause that all state functionaries take a public oath of allegiance to the constitution upon assuming office.
	Making the supervisory commission a new state organ, responsible for a national system of supervision for “all public servants exercising public power.”

Xi’s roles in China’s government structure
The CCP is the main political party in China, with 85 million members, and has the power to set the country’s policy directions and supervise the implementation of those policies. The party is also responsible for selecting and appointing government officials. 
Xi became party leader when he was elected general secretary of the CCP Central Committee in 2012. There are no term limits to being general secretary of the CCP. Xi was named the “core” or core leader of the Central Committee in 2016.
China’s national legislative body, the National People’s Congress, is responsible for enacting laws and appointing the president. Xi became president of China in 2013.
The PLA is led by the Central Military Commission of the CCP. Xi was named chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming the commander-in-chief of the PLA in 2012. There are no term limits to being chairman of the Central Military Commission.

26210,2018-02-27,US Supreme Court declines to review DACA ruling before appeals court,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined the Trump administration’s request for an immediate review of a January injunction from a federal district court on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The injunction ordered parts of DACA to remain in place, challenging the administration’s stated plans to rescind the program. The latest decision means that while the legal case is pending, individuals who are currently part of DACA can continue to work legally in the U.S. and renew their status, which expires every two years. 
The administration had also appealed the ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. No dates have been set for hearing arguments, though lawyers have been given dates through April to file briefs. After the appeals court ruling, the case could be returned to the Supreme Court. 
If Congress passes legislation to grant current and potential DACA recipients legal status, then further court rulings will be unnecessary. There has been a bipartisan effort in the Senate to legislate a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, although the latest bill proposed did not pass. Ending DACA would potentially make 800,000 young adults currently under the program eligible for deportation.

26294,2018-02-28,What the Chinese are saying online about the proposed constitutional change,"In their coverage of China’s proposed constitutional change, some Western media outlets suggested the move would allow President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely and could lead to more authoritarian rule. Many outlets didn’t include much about Chinese public opinion regarding the move. Access to such information may be curtailed by internet censorship and limited press freedom, but we searched Chinese media outlets, search engines and social media on the day of the announcement to see what we could find. 
Chinese media coverage
China’s state-run Xinhua news agency covered the announcement on its English- and Chinese-language sites, as did the English-language version of China’s Global Times. None of the outlets discussed the possible effects the change in policy might have on the country’s leadership. Here is the extent of the announcement as it appeared on Xinhua’s English-language site. Note: this was the eighth point in a list of 11 possible policy changes announced within the same article.

-- Chinese President and Vice-President
The [CCP] Central Committee proposed revising the clause “The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the People’s Republic of China is the same as that of the National People’s Congress, and they shall serve no more than two consecutive terms” to “The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the People’s Republic of China is the same as that of the National People’s Congress.”

Search results in China
On the day of the announcement, western and Chinese search engine results indicated Chinese-language media outlets either briefly mentioned the policy change (as noted above), along with other proposed changes, or they did not include the information at all. Here’s a snapshot of search results from four of China’s most frequented sites or portals.

	SINA displayed one article titled, “Cadres and the masses firmly support the [CCP] Central Committee to amend part of the Constitution.” The article didn’t list specific changes relating to presidential terms.
	WANGYI displayed one article titled, “The great significance of Carrying the Socialist Thoughts with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era of Xi Jinping into the Constitution.” The article also didn’t contain specifics about the term changes. 
	SOHU featured the same article as Xinhua. This change to presidential terms was listed as 14th out of 21 points, and it was bolded. However, the article was positioned in the “finance and stock market” sidebar on the site’s home page. 
	QQ also featured the same article as Xinhua and, as in SOHU, it listed the point in question as 14 out of a total of 21 points.

The exposure the announcement reportedly had in Chinese media may have contributed to public opinion being limited on the matter. Search results may also have been impacted by limited press freedom. For instance, Reporters Without Borders ranked China 176 out of 180 countries in its 2016 worldwide index of press freedom. For more on media censorship in China, see this Council on Foreign Relations report.
Social media
Reuters reported that “though positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets like the People’s Daily, the move was not welcomed by everyone on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service.” The outlet cited one such opinion from a Weibo user: “If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!”
Some articles on the aforementioned Chinese portals allowed user comments. On the day of the announcement, we reviewed the available comments on the following portals: 25 comments on SINA, 11,877 on QQ and 554 on WANGYI. We briefly reviewed other online forums as well. No comments voicing opposition to the proposed constitutional changes were found in our sample. 
Many of the comments we reviewed were similarly worded. Here are a few such examples from one online forum under “Topic: Proposal of the CPC Central Committee on Revising Part of the Constitution.”

	“Resolutely support the resolution of the Party Central Committee.”
	“Resolutely support the resolution of the Party Central Committee. Amending the constitution is the most solid step in realizing the Chinese dream. In order to actualize the Chinese dream, [let's] work hard. Come on!”
	“Amending the constitution is a step toward realizing the Chinese dream. We resolutely support the resolutions of the Party Central Committee. In order to actualize the Chinese dream, [let’s] roll up our sleeves and do it. Come on!!!”
	“Every amendment to the constitution is to enrich and perfect the rights of the Chinese people. Both are the result of the Party Central Committee and the government conforming to public opinions and respecting public opinion, and they uphold their support. [I] support and praise [it].”

The above comments, and the lack of comments voicing disapproval, may have been influenced by the government’s monitoring of social media platforms in China. Given the limitations in data, it’s difficult to determine whether Chinese citizens agree or disagree with the constitutional change to term limits. We did obtain data from the China-based family and associates of one of our media analysts. Although not an indicator of overall opinion, the individuals we surveyed appeared to either not have an opinion on the issue, or expressed support for Xi’s leadership.
Public opinion on Xi Jinping
We were unable to locate Chinese opinion polls on Xi or the constitutional changes. At least one U.S.-based poll has published his, and other world leaders’, overall public support.
A 2014 study conducted by Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation showed majority public support for Xi’s policies. (Note: the report did not include its methodology). When asked about domestic and international affairs, 94.8 percent and 93.8 percent of Chinese respondents, respectively, had confidence in Xi’s handling of those issues. When ranked on a 10-point scale, with 10 being the best, his citizens gave him an average score of 9. Regarding these points, the study’s researchers noted:

We see a clear correlation between political systems and the ratings of their own leaders by the respondents. In countries where discussion of leaders is more constrained, the national leaders rate very highly.

When compared with the ratings of nine other world leaders, Xi’s was the highest. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who scored an 8.7 out of 10, came in second. The study also noted that citizens in countries with two or more dominant political parties are “more critical” of their national leaders and policies, compared to nations where politics are “less contested.”",Context|Politics|World,Asia,,CCP|Chinese Communist Party|Xi Jinping,Beijing|China,constitutional amendment|government,world_news,publish
26304,2018-02-28,Supreme Court rules against granting detained immigrants the right to periodic bond hearings,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that detained immigrants involved in removal proceedings do not have the right to bond hearings every six months. Such immigrants include asylum seekers and legal permanent residents who have been detained for suspected criminal activity. The court voted 5-3 to reverse a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that had ruled immigrant detainees had the right to periodic bond hearings at which the government must show “clear and convincing evidence” that continued detention is necessary in order to keep the immigrant in custody.
The case, Jennings et al. v. Rodriguez, involved permanent legal resident Alejandro Rodriguez, who was brought to the U.S. as a child. Rodriguez had been convicted of joyriding while a teenager, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for possessing a controlled substance when he was 24. He was detained for three years without bond hearings, pending a decision on whether to deport him. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a class action lawsuit on his behalf. Others who joined the suit had been detained without a bond hearing for an average of 13 months.
The Supreme Court ruled that the lower court “detected ambiguity” in the wording of the law in question that said the aliens “may be detained” and “noted the absence of any explicit statutory limit on the length of permissible detention.” A section of the U.S. Criminal Code specifies that the Attorney General “may release” one of the detained aliens “only if the Attorney General decides” both that the person is not a “flight risk” and it is “necessary for witness-protection purposes,” according to the Supreme Court ruling.
Justices Samuel Alito Jr., Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts voted to overturn the Ninth Court's ruling; Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor voted to uphold the right to periodic bond hearings. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case. The Washington Post said she did not provide a reason for the recusal, though she had been involved in the case while she was solicitor general in the Obama administration.
The case is now scheduled to return to the Ninth Court for further consideration, including whether detained immigrants have a constitutional right to bond hearings.

26297,2018-02-28,US Cyber Command head tells Senate committee he doesn’t have ‘additional authorities’ to address alleged Russian interference,"During a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, the Director of U.S. Cyber Command, Adm. Mike Rogers, said he has not been granted “additional authorities” to take measures to deter Russian cyber interference efforts at the “origin” of the alleged attacks. That authority would need to be granted by U.S. President Donald Trump through Defense Secretary James Mattis. Rogers said he had not requested more authority. 
“I’ve never been given any specific direction to take additional steps outside my authority,” said Rogers, who also heads the National Security Agency (NSA). He said there are “some things” he has the authority to do and he is “acting on that authority.” He told the questioning senator that he could go into more detail in a classified setting. 
When asked about whether economic deterrents, such as sanctions, are “effective” as part of the effort to address cybersecurity threats, Rogers replied he thought they were “positive.” He said he believed Russia had “not paid a price that is sufficient to change” its behavior over alleged cyber interference efforts in American elections.
At a White House press briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked why Rogers had not been granted “additional authority” to “confront” alleged Russian cyber interference in the U.S. Sanders said the Secretary of Homeland Security had “met with a number of both state, local, and federal officials working on ways that we can best prevent things like this in the future.”
In a written statement, Rogers said that U.S. Cyber Command has an operating budget of more than $600 million this fiscal year and a full-time staff of 1,060. At the end of last year, 5,070 people, civilians and members of the military worked for the Cyber Mission Force.

Recent updates on alleged Russian cyber interference
Two weeks ago, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats testified at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that there “should be no doubt that Russia perceived its past efforts as successful.” He alleged that Russia “views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian midterm operations.”
Last week, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. 
Congress authorized new sanctions against Russia in August of last year, for Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, its ongoing military actions in eastern Ukraine and its alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump delayed the implementation of new sanctions against Russia in January of this year.

26307,2018-02-28,UN source says illicit shipments from North Korea to Syria could be used for chemical weapons,"A U.N. report indicated North Korea has shipped supplies to Syria that may constitute a violation of U.N. sanctions, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. North Korea allegedly sent Syria acid-resistant tiles, valves and thermometers, the report said. Such materials have multiple potential uses, one of which is the production of chemical weapons. 
The U.N. report has not been publicly released. The Times reported that it reviewed a copy of the document. The report said there were at least 40 shipments of prohibited materials from North Korea to Syria between 2012 and 2017, according to the Times. The U.N. document alleged that North Korean missile technicians had been seen at “known” chemical weapons and missile facilities in Syria in 2016.
A U.N. spokesman said that since 2006, the U.N. Security Council has required North Korea “to cease export of arms and related material as well as items relevant to nuclear, ballistic missiles and other weapons of mass destruction-related programs.” In 2010, the council mandated that a panel of eight experts to investigate and report possible sanction violations by North Korea. That panel reportedly drafted the document cited by the Times.
In 2013, two years into the Syrian civil war, the Obama administration alleged that the Syrian government had used sarin gas in Ghouta. After that, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad agreed to destroy Syria's chemical weapons and his country joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. A U.N. panel said that Syrian government forces used sarin gas in Khan Sheikhoun in April of last year, killing at least 83 people. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons.

A Boeing official said that Air Force One includes a “communications suite, internal and external stairs, large galleys and other equipment.” The Hill reports that Air Force One also comes with “sophisticated defenses.” 
Trump had been negotiating a new Air Force One contract since after he was elected in 2016, Fox News reported. The current Air Force One aircraft are modified Boeing 747s from when Ronald Reagan was president.

26370,2018-03-01,Syria begins ground offensive in eastern Ghouta; no civilians evacuate during daily 'ceasefires',"Syria initiated a ground offensive into eastern Ghouta on Wednesday. A commander in the forces backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Syria's Tiger Force elite unit was participating in the operation. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said a ground assault had begun on Sunday and resumed Wednesday, and that government forces were advancing and taking losses. No civilians reportedly left eastern Ghouta during a five-hour daily ceasefire called for by Russia.
Russia called for the daily five-hour ceasefires starting Tuesday so aid could enter Ghouta, and civilians and the wounded could leave through a ""humanitarian corridor."" Bombing and mortar shelling reportedly occurred during the ceasefire hours on Tuesday. SOHR reported no bombing from the air during Wednesday's ceasefire. Russia and Syria said rebels shelled the humanitarian corridor so that people would not leave. Rebels denied the claim, and said fear of the Syrian government was preventing people from leaving Ghouta. No aid was reported to have entered Ghouta.
On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling for a 30-day nationwide ceasefire in Syria. It called for weekly humanitarian aid deliveries in addition to medical evacuations. It also called for an end to sieges of populated areas including eastern Ghouta, Yarmouk, Foua and Kefraya. The ceasefire did not apply to the Islamic State, Al-Qaida, Al-Nusra Front and others associated with organizations designated as ""terrorist groups"" by the Security Council.
On Monday, a medical official in Damascus said 36 people had been killed there by rebel shelling over four days. Russian President Vladimir Putin said shells had hit the territory of the Russian Embassy and trade mission in Damascus. He said some mortar strikes came from groups designated as terrorist organizations by the U.N.
Syria's civil war began in 2011. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by government forces since 2013. At least 500 people have been killed there since Feb. 18. The USAID  government agency said there were three suspected chemical attacks by Syria in eastern Ghouta in 2018, including the alleged use of chlorine gas on Feb. 1. Syria has denied using chemical weapons.

26375,2018-03-01,Afghan President Ghani calls for peace talks with Taliban,"At the 2nd Kabul Process Conference on Wednesday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he was willing to recognize the Taliban as a political group if it recognized the Afghan government and respected Afghan laws. He said, ""We will consider the Taliban's view in the peace talks."" He mentioned some possible negotiation items for a peace agreement with the Taliban, such as new elections that included the group, release of prisoners and a constitutional review. 
Ghani also said the government could provide passports and visa services to Taliban members and consider removing sanctions against its leaders. He called upon the Taliban to declare itself a political group and negotiate a ceasefire. He said, ""We are making this offer without preconditions in order to lead to a peace agreement."" The U.N. mission in Afghanistan said it ""strongly supports the vision for peace through intra-Afghan dialogue.""
Ghani also called for talks with Pakistan. Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of aiding the Taliban; Pakistan has denied the claim.
A Taliban official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Taliban leaders were studying Ghani's proposal. 
More than 20 countries were present at the conference where Ghani spoke. The first Kabul Process for Peace and Security Cooperation Conference was held in June of last year. 
In 2001, the U.S. led an invasion of Afghanistan that removed the Taliban from power. A new government was set up in Kabul, the capital. The Taliban was still present in parts of the country. Last year more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in conflicts between government forces and the Taliban. The group claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul on Jan. 27 in which an ambulance containing explosives was driven into the city and exploded, killing at least 103 and injuring about 235.

26506,2018-03-02,Putin gives annual state of the nation address,"Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual address to the Russian Federal Assembly, made up of both houses of parliament. In the televised two-hour long speech on Thursday, Putin spent about half of the address speaking about Russia’s domestic development, including plans for improving the economy and education. He spent the remaining half of his speech talking about Russia’s security, including the development of new nuclear-armed weapons. 
Putin, 65, is running for reelection in Russia’s upcoming presidential election, scheduled for Mar. 18. If he wins against the seven candidates running against him, it would be his fourth six-year term. 
Domestic development
Putin spoke about the government’s plans for development, including:

	reforming the national healthcare system, and setting a goal to increase life expectancy in Russia to over 80 years
	introducing more affordable bank loans and housing development projects designed to increase prosperity
	goals to continue to reduce poverty, saying that in the year 2000 there were 42 million people in Russia living below the poverty line, and currently there are 20 million.
	upgrading transport lines to become a route for trade between Europe and Asia
	investing in Russia’s energy grid, internet infrastructure and satellite communications, with a goal to become one of the world’s centers for storing and processing “big data”
	improving the education system, with a focus on job skills training.
	establishing new scientific centers with technologically-advanced equipment, and passing legislation aimed at attracting leading scientists to develop the centers.
	reducing the number of state-owned businesses in Russia’s economy, including privatizing banks.

Security and weapons development
Putin said Russia has developed weapons in response to the U.S.’ withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and the continued development of the U.S.’ anti-ballistic missile capabilities. Through his speech and with the use of video animations, Putin described the new weapons, saying Russia:

	developed a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) known as Sarmat.
	developed a new nuclear reactor which can be mounted on a sea-launched or air-launched cruise missile. The unnamed system with a “practically unlimited range” can travel “an unpredictable flight path,” Putin said.
	possesses an underwater drone with a smaller and more powerful nuclear reactor than earlier models.
	possesses a hypersonic missile called Kinzhal (dagger) that can carry a nuclear warhead.
	developed a hypersonic gliding warhead called Avangard (vanguard) that is being serially produced.

U.S. response
U.S. officials were “not surprised” by Putin’s speech, said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White. Earlier this month, the Pentagon released its “Nuclear Posture Review,” a report that said Russia is developing a “a hypersonic glide vehicle, and a new intercontinental, nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo.”

26503,2018-03-02,"Trump: US to impose steel, aluminum tariffs","On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that starting next week the U.S. would impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports. Trump said, “We’re going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not provide more details and said the tariffs were being finalized. 
The U.S. produced 86.5 million tons of steel in 2016, it imports more than four times the amount it exports, and sources its imports from 110 countries and territories, according to BBC. 
Canada buys over 50 percent of exported U.S. steel and is the largest supplier of steel imports to the U.S., providing 16 percent, according to Reuters. Brazil and South Korea sell the second and third largest amounts to the U.S. China is the eleventh largest supplier of steel to the U.S., providing two percent, according to BBC. 
International response
Canada’s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said any tariffs would be “absolutely unacceptable” and if implemented, Canada would “take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.”
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU would “react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests.” The EU has reportedly drafted a plan to tax $3.5 billion of U.S. imports, including bourbon, blue jeans, orange juice and motorcycles, should the U.S. impose tariffs next week. The EU estimates the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum would cost the bloc $3.5 billion. About 15 percent of the EU’s 2017 steel exports went to the U.S., according to European steel association Eurofer. 
Earlier this month, Wang Hejun, chief of the Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau at China’s Ministry of Commerce, said if the final decision on steel tariffs “impacts China’s interests, China will certainly take necessary measures to protect its own rights.”
Trump’s tweets after the international response
On Saturday, Trump tweeted, “If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!”
The E.U. currently imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. passenger car imports. The U.S. imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on passenger car imports from the EU. In 2016, Europe exported €37.7 billion (then $40.1 billion) worth of passenger cars to the U.S., according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).

26499,2018-03-02,US ambassador to Mexico announces her resignation,"The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, announced on Thursday that she would resign in May. Jacobson made the announcement in a letter sent to embassy staff. She did not give a reason for the resignation. Jacobson said she had “come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures.” A replacement has not been publicly announced. 
Later on Twitter, Jacobson, 57, said in Spanish that after 31 years working for the U.S. government, it has been an “honor and a pleasure to serve” as ambassador. She tweeted that she was leaving to pursue “other opportunities,” and has no information about who would succeed her in the position. Jacobson wrote that she believed relations between the U.S. and Mexico are “strong” and “crucial,” ending her tweet saying, “We are stronger together!”
Jacobson had informed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of her decision to resign while he was visiting Mexico in January, according to U.S. Undersecretary of State Steve Goldstein. He said Jacobson agreed to stay on until May 5, two years after being sworn into the role. She had been appointed ambassador during the Obama administration, and had previously served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.
Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said it had been informed of the decision on February 17. The department said that three days later it had received a request to approve the appointment of a replacement, and did so on Monday, according to AP. The Washington Post reported that, according to anonymous U.S. and Mexican officials, the White House planned to appoint Edward Whitacre, the former CEO of General Motors and ATT, as ambassador. 
US-Mexican relations
Bilateral trade between the U.S. and Mexico totaled $579.7 billion in 2016. The two countries, along with Canada, are currently in the seventh round of talks in Mexico City to renegotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
U.S. President Donald Trump has called for a wall to be built along parts of the U.S.-Mexican border, and previously requested that Mexico provide funding for it. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has said his country would not pay for a border wall. Last week, the countries canceled a plan for Peña Nieto to visit the White House after a disagreement on the issue during a 50-minute phone call.

26493,2018-03-02,South African president says possible land reallocations would be handled with ‘responsibility and care’,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday that a plan to potentially transfer land from some of the white minority to the black majority would be handled with “care and responsibility,” and that there would be “no smash and grab.” Earlier this week, the South African parliament voted to pursue amending the country’s constitution to allow the government to reallocate land from some white people without compensation. The parliament passed the motion 241 to 83 on Tuesday, and instructed a committee to review the constitution and report back by August 30. 
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party brought the motion to parliament, and the ruling African National Congress (ANC) supported an amended version of the measure. EFF leader Julius Malema said, “we must ensure that we restore the dignity of our people without compensating the criminals who stole our land.” Two weeks ago, after Ramaphosa was sworn in as the new president, he said he would prioritize land reform.
The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, opposed the motion, arguing that it would damage property rights and could deter international investment. An unrelated group that represents mostly white South Africans, called AfriForum, said it planned to begin an international campaign against the measure, arguing its position to international governments.
A law from 1913 had granted the majority of fertile farming land to whites and, according to the Associated Press, the possibility of land reform has been discussed since the end of apartheid and the election of the ANC led government in 1994.

26579,2018-03-03,Burkina Faso: Attacks on local army HQ and French embassy kill at least 7,"Attackers killed at least seven soldiers at the French embassy and local army headquarters in the West African nation of Burkina Faso on Friday. According to the Burkinabe communications minister, six attackers were killed at the two sites in the capital city of Ouagadougou. France's foreign minister reported there were no known French casualties. The attack on the army headquarters, which was initiated with an explosion, also injured about 50 people.

Authorities have not identified who was responsible for the attacks, CNN reported.
Witnesses at the national television office said five attackers in a pickup truck drove to the front of the French embassy, set fire to the truck, yelled ""Allahu Akbar"" and began shooting. ""Allahu Akbar"" is Arabic for ""God is greatest.""
France is currently engaged in a counterinsurgency operation against militant groups in the region. As part of its Operation Barkhane, started in 2014, France has sent about 4,000 soldiers to the Sahel region of Africa. The troops support forces in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger against groups such as the Defense Group of Islam and Muslims. 
Last year, attackers shot and killed 18 people outside a Turkish restaurant in Ouagadougou. In 2016, an attack on a cafe and hotel killed 29 in the city.
UNICEF said at least 98 schools have been closed in Burkina Faso for security issues.
Burkina Faso, a former French colony that gained its independence in 1960, used to be called the Republic of Upper Volta.

26576,2018-03-03,Delta Air Lines is reconsidering its discounts for 'politically divisive’ groups,"Delta Air Lines is considering ending “group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature,” according to a statement CEO Ed Bastian released on Friday. Delta’s announcement comes almost a week after it rescinded a discount for National Rifle Association (NRA) members traveling to the firearms organization’s annual meeting. 
Delta previously said it has more than 2,000 group discount contracts.
Last Saturday, Delta canceled a one-time discount it had offered to NRA members, saying the discount could have been seen “as Delta implicitly endorsing” the NRA. “That is not the case,” the airline said, adding that the decision was made to “remain neutral” and remove itself from the “debate” on gun control. The airline also asked to have its logo removed from the NRA website.
Delta said it supported the Second Amendment and the entire Constitution.
Some other companies have also ended discounts for NRA members since the Feb. 14 shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 students and teachers. 
Delta is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The day before Delta announced it would reconsider discounts for “politically divisive” groups, Georgia's legislature passed a tax bill. The version that passed removed a provision that would have exempted jet fuel from sales tax. That tax exemption would have saved Delta an estimated $40 million in taxes, according to Business Insider. 
Delta’s Friday statement said “some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,” and noted that the decision on the NRA discounts “was not made for economic gain.”
Prior to passing the tax bill, Georgia's Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle (R) said the measure would not contain the jet fuel exemption if Delta did not reinstate its discount to NRA members. Georgia's Governor Nathan Deal (R) said he would sign the tax reform bill into law without the exemption.

26582,2018-03-03,Israeli police question PM Netanyahu in corruption case,"Police questioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara on Friday as part of a corruption investigation, Case 4000. The case involves suspected bribes between the Ministry of Communications, which Netanyahu directed during the time period the alleged crimes occurred, and a private company. Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing.  
The Communications Ministry introduced regulatory benefits that prosecutors say were worth up to about 1 billion shekels ($280 million) to Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq. Investigators allege that in exchange, Bezeq provided Netanyahu favorable news coverage on online media outlet Walla! News. 
Netanyahu was questioned for five hours at his residence. At the same time, his wife was questioned at a police station. 
Afterwards, Netanyahu posted a video on Facebook that said he and wife were innocent. “There will be nothing because there is nothing."" 

Earlier this week, Israel's former Communications Ministry Director General Shlomo Filber agreed to be a government witness in Case 4000. As of Tuesday, Filber and six other people had been arrested in the case on charges of bribery, fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. They all denied the accusations. According to CNN, a ninth person was detained in connection to the case on Friday.
Police have previously named Netanyahu as a suspect in corruption Cases 1000 and 2000, and recommended to Israel's attorney general that he be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. He has not been indicted, and denied those allegations as well.

26570,2018-03-03,Italy to hold national elections on Sunday,"On Sunday, Italians will vote in national elections for 630 members of the lower chamber and 315 members of the Senate. A party or coalition that forms a majority government can nominate a prime minister. Sunday’s vote will be the first under a new electoral system that, according to BBC, “encourages” parties to form pre-election coalitions. (Keep reading for more about the electoral changes.) 
The parties running in the election include:

	the Forza Italia (FI) party, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 81
	the Eurosceptic Lega party, (which has formed a coalition with the FI party) led by Matteo Salvini, 44 
	the Democratic Party (PD), led by Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, 43
	the Five Star Movement (M5S), led by Luigi Di Maio, 31

Berlusconi cannot be nominated for prime minister due to a criminal conviction for tax fraud. The current Italian president is Sergio Mattarella and the prime minister is Paolo Gentiloni, of Renzi’s PD party. 
To vote for members of the lower chamber, Italians must be 18 years old, and to vote for the Senate they must be 25 years old, according to BBC. Polls close on Sunday at 11 p.m. local time. 
Italian unemployment is 11 percent, the highest in the EU, and it has the second largest national debt in the union, following that of Greece. Italy has the third largest economy of the 28-member countries of the EU, not including the U.K., which plans to leave the bloc.
New electoral system
This is the first election under a law that includes part first-past-the-post and part proportional representation. First-past-the-post (FPTP) refers to election systems that grant a seat to the candidate who receives the most votes in his or her district, similar to systems in the U.S. 
Proportional representation (PR) electoral systems grant seats to candidates based on the percentage of total votes that party receives. For example, in a basic PR system, if a party receives 25 percent of the votes, it would get to fill 25 percent of the seats with its preferred candidates,regardless of the local area in which each candidate lives.  
The new Italian electoral system allots some seats to be filled by FPTP, and some by PR. For instance, in the lower house of parliament, 232 of the 630 seats (about 37 percent) will be filled by FPTP, another 386 (about 61 percent) by PR, and the remaining seats will be voted in by overseas constituencies.

The minimum required for a majority would be 316 parliamentary seats in the lower house. The Five Star Movement, led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, won the most votes at 32.22 percent. There have been no official coalitions announced that would equal a majority in the government.
Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party won the second most votes at 18.9 percent. Renzi resigned as prime minister in Dec. 2016.
Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party won 13.94 percent, and Giorgia Meloni’s Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) won 4.35 percent. The two parties are already part of a coalition, giving a combined 18.29 of the vote.
Matteo Salvini’s Lega (League) party won 17.69 percent of the vote in third place for a single party.
Berlusconi, 81, cannot hold public office until next year due to a tax fraud conviction, BBC reported.
The Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, the League and the Brothers of Italy have campaigned on issues relating to illegal immigration. At least 600,000 migrants have come to Italy from Libya since 2013, BBC reported. The League, formerly called “The Northern League,” previously promoted secession from the country. The Democratic Party campaigned on economic issues. The First Star Movement has discussed a universal income.

26743,2018-03-05,"Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union, Social Democratic Party agree to form ‘grand coalition’","The Social Democratic Party (SPD) announced the formation of a “grand coalition” with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) on Sunday after SPD members voted to join the CDU/CSU alliance. The agreement was reached more than five months after Merkel’s CDU/CSU party alliance won the most seats in general elections. The CDU/CSU and SPD have governed in a coalition since 2013.
Sixty-six percent of the estimated 463,000 SPD party members who participated in the coalition vote opted to continue with the partnership; 34 percent voted against it. The parties agreed on a deal that included plans regarding health insurance, taxes and refugee intake, and gave SPD the ability to appoint individuals to certain ministerial posts, such as the Finance Ministry. The SPD must now sign the agreement; the CDU signed it last week at a party conference.
SPD’s acting party Chairman Olaf Scholz said the coalition “gives us the strength for the process of renewal we are embarking upon.” Via the CDU’s official Twitter account, Merkel said, “I congratulate the SPD on this clear result and I'm looking forward to continuing our good work together for the good of the country.” Merkel, 63, is scheduled to be sworn in for her fourth term as chancellor on Mar. 14.
Background
In Germany’s general election in September, the CDU/CSU alliance received the most votes, at 33 percent. The ruling party had to form a coalition with one or more political parties to hold at least 50 seats in parliament. At the time, SPD leader Martin Schulz said his party would not enter into a coalition with CDU/CSU in the new parliament. The SPD had received 20.5 percent of votes, making it the second largest political party in Germany. Schulz has since resigned from his SPD position.
In November, Merkel’s CDU/CSU alliance unsuccessfully attempted to form a coalition with the Green Party and Free Democratic Party (FDP). According to German law, if a coalition is not reached, the parties can form a minority government, or the president can call for new elections.

26871,2018-03-06,South Korean delegation meets with Kim Jong Un in North Korea,"South Korean officials visiting the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang met with the North’s leader Kim Jong Un over dinner Monday night. North Korean state media reported that Kim expressed a “firm will” to “advance” north-south relations and “write a new history of national reunification.” The South Korean 10-person delegation extended an invitation to Kim from the South’s President Moon Jae-in to attend further talks. Both sides said there was a “satisfactory agreement” to hold future talks, according to BBC. 
Monday’s state dinner lasted approximately four hours, according to the South Korean government, and was also attended by Kim’s wife Ri Sol-ju and sister Kim Yo-jong.
This was the first group of South Korean officials to meet with Kim since he took power in 2011 after his father’s death. The South’s delegation, which includes National Security Advisor Chung Eui-yong, intelligence chief Suh Hoon and Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung, is scheduled to have another meeting with North Korean officials on Tuesday morning.
Later this week, the delegation is scheduled to travel to the U.S. to brief officials on the outcome of the North-South talks. 
North Korea is currently under U.N. sanctions for its missile development and nuclear program. The U.S. said it is “cautiously optimistic” about improving relations between North and South Korea. President Donald Trump has said talks between Washington and North Korea are possible “under the right conditions.”

26839,2018-03-06,Trump meets with Israeli PM Netanyahu at the White House,"President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Monday, and discussed the U.S. decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. In a press conference, Trump said the decision, which he originally announced in December, was “much appreciated” in Israel and elsewhere. Netanyahu thanked Trump for the the decision on “behalf of the people of Israel” and said the American-Israeli alliance had “never been stronger.” 
Trump said construction of the embassy was already underway, that it would be built “quickly” and would cost about $250,000. Last month, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that the new facility would open by the end of next year, and that this spring the U.S. ambassador and a small staff would begin working at the temporary facility. When asked if Trump would go to Jerusalem for the opening of the new embassy, he said he “may.”
Netanyahu told reporters the leaders would be discussing Iran’s “aggressions” and “nuclear ambitions,” and the Iran nuclear deal. He said, “Iran must be stopped,” calling it their “common challenge.” 
Netanyahu also said they would discuss peace negotiations for the Middle East. Trump said that peace between Israel and the Palestinians “would be a great thing for the world,” the country and “everybody,” and they were “working very hard on it.”
This is the fifth time Trump and Netanyahu have met since Trump took office in 2017. Netanyahu arrived with his wife Sara.

26814,2018-03-06,IS releases video allegedly showing Oct. Niger attack on US soldiers,"Over the weekend, the Islamic State (IS) released a video compilation allegedly showing an attack on four U.S. soldiers in Niger last October. 

The nine-minute long video includes footage showing armed militants walking and running, and U.S. soldiers driving away in a white vehicle. The footage appears to have come from the helmet camera of one of the U.S. soldiers, according to BBC and other media outlets. The alleged helmet-camera footage appears to show U.S. soldiers taking fire, returning fire, running and then the viewpoint of the camera falls and remains still as militants fire shots at point blank range. 
The video also includes still images that allegedly show members of the Sahel-based group Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) pledging allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The video was reportedly released on the Telegram messaging application. 
Speaking at the Pentagon, Col. Rob Manning, director of Defense press operations did not confirm the authenticity of the video footage. “We didn’t produce the video. We can’t confirm something that we didn’t produce.” Manning requested the U.S. media not to purchase or show the videos, so as not to “aid” in IS recruiting. 
October attack
A joint Niger-U.S. patrol was attacked near the village of Tongo Tongo in Niger on Oct. 4 last year while on a mission to search for a particular IS member. Four U.S. soldiers were killed, one of whom was originally reported missing. The troops did not expect to encounter enemy forces at the time of the attack, according to Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
An investigation into the incident was completed by the U.S. Africa Command and the report is currently being reviewed by U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, according to Manning. 
There are about 800 U.S. troops in Niger aiding in counterinsurgency operations, according to BBC.

27030,2018-03-07,US Office of Special Counsel alleges White House adviser Kellyanne Conway violated Hatch Act,"The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) said on Tuesday that White House aide Kellyanne Conway had violated the Hatch Act last year by talking about candidates for Alabama's special election for U.S. senator. The Hatch Act prohibits ""partisan"" “political activity” by federal employees while on duty. The OSC said Conway violated the act by “advocating for and against candidates” during interviews in her “official capacity.” The White House denied this. 
 
 The OSC referred the matter to the president for “consideration of appropriate disciplinary action.
Conway gave interviews to Fox News' ""Fox  Friends"" introduced Conway as a ""counselor to President Trump"" and she spoke about Doug Jones, who was at the time the Democratic Senate candidate from Alabama. Among other things, she said Jones would be ""a vote against tax cuts,” adding that “he's weak on crime, weak on borders. He's strong on raising your taxes."" 
Conway also made comments about what Jones was ""for"" and ""against"" on ""New Day"" on Dec. 6. According to the OSC, Conway was given talking points by the White House for the two interviews and did not adhere to those points when mentioning Jones.
White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Conway “did not advocate for or against the election of any particular candidate.” He added that she “simply expressed” the president's “position” of having “people in the House and Senate who support his agenda.” 
Gidley said Conway's statements showed “her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act -- as she twice declined to respond to the host's specific invitation to encourage Alabamians to vote for the Republican.”
The Hatch Act of 1939 prohibits federal employees from engaging in ""political activity"" while ""on duty or in the workplace."" It falls under the purview of the Office of Special Counsel, which is separate from special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. An OSC fact sheet defines political activity as ""any activity directed at the success or failure of a partisan group or candidate in a partisan election."" The act doesn't apply to the president.

27036,2018-03-07,West Virginia passes 5% raise for state employees after teachers strike for 9 school days,"West Virginia passed a bill on Tuesday that would raise the pay of state employees, including teachers, by five percent. About 22,000 teachers in the state went on strike on Feb. 22, with the support of three school unions. Union leaders said teachers would go back to work if Gov. Jim Justice signed the 5 percent raise into law.
The American Federation of Teachers said the agreement with lawmakers reached on Tuesday would include keeping premiums on teachers’ health plans the same for 16 months. Justice also agreed to form a task force by March 13 to examine the state health insurance program. Senate Finance Chair Craig Blair said the budget would be reduced in other areas to offset the cost of the raises.
The West Virginia teachers' strike is the longest in the state's history, according to Bloomberg. The last time teachers received a state-wide pay raise was in 2014. The state ranks 48th in the U.S. for teachers’ average annual salaries, according to the National Education Association.
Teachers in Oklahoma are reportedly also considering striking over pay. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary for teachers in Oklahoma is the lowest in the U.S. The Oklahoma Education Association (OEA) said teachers could go on strike unless lawmakers pass a bill to give teachers raises by a certain time that it will announce later. The Oklahoma legislature has not passed teacher raises in the past 10 years, according to Bloomberg.

27033,2018-03-07,"Russian military airplane crashes in Syria, killing all 39 onboard","The Russian Defense Ministry reported on Tuesday that one of its An-26 airplanes had crashed in Syria, killing all 39 Russian soldiers onboard. The aircraft crashed while landing, about 1,640 ft (500 m) before the runway at Khmeimim military airbase in western Syria. The Russian ministry said that the plane did not appear to have been fired upon, and an investigation into the crash was underway.
Russian forces have been in Syria since September 2015, supporting President Bashar al-Assad’s fight against opposition groups and the Islamic State. At least 44 Russian soldiers have died in operations there, according to Reuters. The outlet reported that Russian authorities do not have to announce all deaths in Syria because these deaths are classified under a decree. 
Last week, Russia called for a daily five-hour ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta, which has been under siege by government forces since 2013, two years after the start of Syria’s civil war. On Monday, a U.N. envoy brought aid to Eastern Ghouta during the ceasefire. A spokesperson for the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said shelling occurred during the nine hours that the envoy was there, and not all trucks were offloaded before the convoy left for security reasons. 
On Tuesday, local medics reported treating civilians in Eastern Ghouta for respiratory issues after a possible chlorine gas attack. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons.

27193,2018-03-08,Justice Department sues California over state laws affecting immigration enforcement,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued California, its governor and attorney general over three state laws that the department says affect enforcement of federal immigration laws. The lawsuit alleges that the state laws, passed last year, are unconstitutional and have ""the purpose and effect of making it more difficult for federal immigration officers to carry out their responsibilities.” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the laws were “fully constitutional.”
The lawsuit says the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution ""does not allow California to obstruct"" the federal government’s ability to enforce laws. It cites the following three California laws that allegedly violate the clause:

	The ""Immigrant Worker Protection Act"" that prohibits private California employers from ""voluntarily cooperating"" with federal requests for immigration-related information on employees.
	Assembly Bill 103 that creates a ""scheme that requires the Attorney General of California to investigate the immigration enforcement efforts of federal agents."" 
	Senate Bill 54 (SB 54), including the ""California Values Act,"" that ""limits the ability of state and local law enforcement officers"" to provide information to federal authorities on some immigrant detainees and to transfer them to federal immigration custody. SB 54 says including state and local agencies in federal immigration enforcement “diverts already limited resources” and “blurs the lines of accountability between local, state, and federal governments.”

The lawsuit said California's SB 54 law would ""require"" federal immigration officers to sometimes ""engage"" in ""dangerous efforts to re-arrest aliens."" It said this would result in ""endangering immigration officers, the alien at issue, and others who may be nearby."" When California passed SB 54, former U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on behalf of the state Senate that the federal government does not have the authority to make California officials help it enforce its immigration laws.
When California Governor Jerry Brown signed the three bills into law in October, he said they provided a “balance that will protect public safety while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day.""
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke about the lawsuit Wednesday at an annual meeting of law enforcement officials in Sacramento, California. During his speech, Sessions said, “California is using every power it has, and some it does not, to frustrate federal law enforcement.” He added, “So you can be sure I’m going to use every power I have to stop them.”
After the speech, the Trump campaign reportedly sent an email to supporters saying, “Americans across the country now can see that Democrats have officially become the party of obstruction, lawlessness, government shutdowns, and of putting illegal immigrants before American citizens… The President is calling on you to stand by him in the face of such flagrant lawlessness.”
Brown and Becerra said after the speech that Sessions’ characterization of the state's laws was ""untrue.” Brown described the law as a ""carefully balanced measure"" that had been endorsed by law enforcement, CNN reported. Referring to the lawsuit, Brown reportedly said, “This is basically going to war against the state of California.”
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that “Californians will continue to proudly keep our doors open to the immigrants who make America more American. We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities.” 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 20,201 people in California during fiscal year 2017, 81 percent of whom had prior criminal convictions.
About ‘sanctuary cities’
Some California localities are so-called ""sanctuary cities.” The term denotes non-compliance with federal statute 8 U.S.C. 1373 — legislation that, among other things, requires local and state governments to provide federal authorities with people’s immigration status information. Some California cities passed legislation making them sanctuary cities before President Donald Trump's election, as San Francisco did in 1989.
Oakland is a self-proclaimed ""sanctuary city,” according to the Los Angeles Times. In February, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf sent an email to residents saying ICE officials were going to conduct a raid, which it did the following week. ICE’s raid resulted in 232 arrests, the outlet reported. 
During the Sacramento speech, Sessions also criticized Schaaf’s actions, saying they may have led to some illegal immigrants not being captured and had “needlessly” endangered the lives of federal immigration officers. Schaaf said her email “was meant to give all residents time to learn their rights and know their legal options.” She added, “We believe our community is safer when families stay together.” The White House said last week that Schaaf’s actions were under review by the DOJ.

27199,2018-03-08,Israel passes law granting interior minister authority to revoke Palestinian residency for ‘breach of trust’,"On Wednesday, Israel passed a law that grants the minister of the interior the authority to revoke the permanent residency status of Palestinians in Jerusalem on the grounds of a ""breach of trust"" with the country. Under the law, the minister also has the power to revoke residency if it was obtained on false information or if the minister determines the individual to have committed a criminal act. The minister’s decision can be appealed.
Under the law, Palestinians considered to have committed a ""breach of trust"" could include “would-be attackers,” those having connections to terrorist groups, and those convicted of terrorism or treason, according to The Times of Israel. 
The law reportedly applies to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The Times of Israel wrote that the law “appears” to apply only to residents of East Jerusalem who have had permanent residency for more than 15 years or who had a parent with permanent residency.
The law passed after the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled in September that the interior ministry did not have the right to revoke residency status on the grounds of a ""breach of trust” as it had done ten years ago for four Palestinians with connections to Hamas. Hamas is considered a terrorist group by Israel and other countries, including the U.S. The High Court suspended the implementation of the ruling until March of this year.
Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri tweeted that the law would enable him to ""maintain the security of Israeli citizens.""
Adalah, a Palestinian rights group based in Israel, alleged that the law is illegal under international humanitarian law. 
Palestinians who are born and live in Jerusalem do not hold Israeli citizenship, Al Jazeera reported. The government issues them ""permanent residency"" identification cards. About 420,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem. Israel has revoked the residency status of at least 14,000 Palestinians since 1967, according to the outlet.
The U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December. The only other country to recognize Jerusalem in this way is Russia, Al Jazeera reported.

27176,2018-03-08,"Sri Lanka declares state of emergency, blocks social media after attacks on Muslim properties","Muslim mosques, businesses, homes and cars were vandalized or set on fire in Sri Lanka on Wednesday, a day after the country declared a state of emergency. The government said Facebook, Viber and Whatsapp would be blocked for three days due to violence that began Sunday between the country’s Sinhalese majority and Muslim minority communities. Police declared a curfew for the district of Kandy through 4 p.m. local time Thursday. Sinhalese Buddhists attacked Muslim mosques and businesses there on Wednesday, Reuters reported. 
According to CNN, the violence began after four Muslim men allegedly beat a Sinhalese Buddhist after a car accident on Sunday. The man later died of his injuries. Police arrested the Muslims allegedly involved in the attack. The vandalism and arson that followed resulted in the death of at least one Muslim in a house in Kandy. 
Some Muslims in the village of Mullegama gathered in a mosque on Wednesday, while groups of Buddhists vandalized and set fire to at least 20 of their homes, The Associated Press reported.
Some Sinhalese groups have alleged that Muslims are ""forcing"" people to convert to Islam and have damaged some Buddhist archaeological sites, according to Reuters. Muslims deny the allegations. 
Reuters also reported that some Buddhists have protested against Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar seeking asylum in Sri Lanka. 
Muslims comprise about 9 percent of Sri Lanka's 21 million people, with Tamils about 13 percent and Buddhist Sinhalese about 70 percent of the population, according to Reuters. A civil war in Sri Lanka between Tamil separatists and the government killed between 40,000 and 100,000 from 1983 to 2009. The majority of Tamils are Hindu. CNN reported the last time Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency was during its civil war.

27179,2018-03-08,"UK official: nerve agent used to poison former Russian spy, daughter","On Wednesday, London Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said a former Russian spy and his daughter had been poisoned by a nerve agent. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, were in critical condition after being found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on Sunday. A policeman who responded to the scene was in “serious” condition. Skripal was a former colonel in GRU, a Russian military intelligence service. 
Rowley said scientists had identified the nerve agent; he did not name the specific compound or how it may have been administered. Police said the Skripals had become unwell at about 1:30 p.m. local time, and that a passerby called police at about 4:15 p.m.
The park bench as well as a restaurant and pub in the area remained cordoned off by authorities.
In 2004, Russian authorities arrested Skripal for providing the British intelligence service MI6 with the names of Russian agents. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006. He was released and moved to the U.K. four years later as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI.

There were women’s protests in 170 countries, Spanish newspaper El País reported. Spain had proposed a general strike with union backing for Thursday in support of gender equality between men and women, according to El País. About 5.3 million people went on strike for a day in Spain, according to unions there. Spanish law prohibits unions from holding strikes that only apply to one of the sexes, so both men and women were allowed to stop working.
The population of Spain in 2016 was 46.4 million, and the labor force in 2017 was 22.9 million, according to the World Bank; the strike represented 11 percent of the population and 23 percent of the labor force.
Spain’s nationwide strikes were an initiative of Comisión 8M, a group of about 400 members of various women’s organizations, El País reported. One hundred and twenty marches and 182 gatherings were planned in 200 Spanish municipalities, according to Comisión 8M. Large unions such as UGT and CC OO called for two-hour strikes, and others such as CGT and CNT called for 24 hours. The female mayors of Barcelona and Madrid supported the strikes.
One of the Spanish protests’ slogans was, “If we stop, the world stops.” Organizers also called upon women to not spend money and not perform domestic work, such as housework, on Thursday. 
A survey of Spaniards by El País found that 82 percent of people said the strikes were “justified,” according to the newspaper. 
In Spain, men in the public sector make an unadjusted average of 13 percent more than women, and in the private sector they make an unadjusted average of 19 percent more, according to Eurostat. Eurostat reported that Spain's ""explained"" gender pay gap is around 4 percent; it's ""explained"" figures account for ""differences in average characteristics of men and women (including sectoral and occupational gender segregations) in the labour market.""
Two of the five female ministers in the Spanish government said they would work longer hours on Thursday to demonstrate the capacity of women for work.
During the strike, Spanish authorities guaranteed certain percentages of transit services would continue on Thursday. This included 50-75 percent of the country’s commuter train lines and 35-65 percent of domestic flights. The National Federation of Self-Employed Workers said the majority of the more than 1.1 million self-employed women in Spain worked on Thursday.
Other demonstrations
People demonstrated in other cities around the world, including: Kabul, Afghanistan; Manila, Philippines; Seoul, South Korea; New Delhi, India; and Karachi, Pakistan. 
In Rome, Catholic women called for increased influence in church governance. Women in Saudi Arabia and in Mosul, Iraq, went out in jogging and running groups. A French newspaper, Libération, increased its price for men by 25 percent for one day. AP reported that, on average, women in France earn 25 percent less than men.
Also on Thursday, the White House announced that First Lady Melania Trump would present the 2018 International Women of Courage Award on March 21.

The prosecutor in the case, Andrew Weissmann, said he expects to call 20 to 25 witnesses at the trial. The judge ordered Manafort to be confined to his home until the trial and wear a GPS tracking bracelet.
Manafort was indicted in Virginia last month. Prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines, in the case of a guilty verdict, include four to five years for bank fraud, and eight to 10 years for filing false tax returns and failing to report foreign bank accounts.
Last month, Manafort pleaded not guilty to charges brought by Mueller's investigation in a Washington, D.C., federal court. The charges there included money laundering, conspiracy and making false statements. The judge in that case set a trial date of Sept. 17. 
Manafort's business partner Rick Gates, also named in the February indictment, pleaded guilty in Washington, D.C., last month to reduced charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Mueller's prosecutors dropped the case against Gates in Virginia after he signed a plea agreement.

27293,2018-03-09,"Doctors in Quebec sign petition for raises to be canceled, funds redistributed","A group representing doctors and medical students in Quebec posted online a petition on Sunday that called for doctors' raises to be canceled and the funds to be distributed for “the good of health care workers.” The group, Médecins québécois pour le régime public (Quebec doctors for the public regime), also called for resources to be distributed “to provide health services worthy” of the people of Quebec. As of midnight Thursday, more than 780 doctors had signed the petition. 
The petition said the region's nurses and other professionals face “difficult working conditions"" due to “cuts in recent years."" CBC News reported that nurses have some mandatory overtime requirements and have had ""staffing issues"" that resulted in nurses caring for ""too many patients.""
Quebec's health minister, Gaétan Barrette, said that the doctors could give up their raises if the majority of doctors voted for such an action. “If they feel they are overpaid, they can leave the money on the table. I guarantee you I can make good use of it.” Barrette added that the doctors who support the action are “still” a “small minority.”
Last month, Quebec's federation of medical specialists negotiated with the province's health ministry for average annual raises of 1.4 percent through 2023 for about 10,000 specialists. This corresponded to an increase in total yearly salaries from $4.7 to $5.4 billion Canadian dollars ($3.6 to $4.2 billion). In October of last year, general practitioners in Quebec signed a deal with the government for average raises of 1.8 percent per year for eight years.
The average yearly salary of a specialist in Quebec in 2015 was about CA$403,537 ($312,000) and in Ontario about CA$367,154 ($285,000), according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). The average salary for Canadian doctors in 2015 was about USD 257,000, according to the CIHI.
Canada has a socialized system of medicine and doctors are paid through the government.

27418,2018-03-10,Martin Shkreli sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud,"Martin Shkreli, a former hedge fund manager and pharmaceutical company CEO, was sentenced to seven years in prison for federal securities fraud on Friday. He was also fined $75,000 in a ruling by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto. Earlier this week, Matsumoto had ruled Shkreli would forfeit more than $7.3 million in a brokerage account and personal assets. Shkreli apologized to his investors, saying, “I am terribly sorry I lost your trust.”
Fraud trial
Shkreli, 34, was arrested by the FBI in Dec. 2015 on fraud charges. On Aug. 4, 2017, a jury found him guilty of three charges: securities fraud in connection with MSMB Capital, securities fraud in connection with MSMB Healthcare and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with Retrophin. He was also found not guilty of five charges.
In September 2017, Matsumoto revoked Shkreli’s $5 million bail for posting online that he would “pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton.” The defense said it was a joke, but Matsumoto ruled it could be seen as “a solicitation of an assault.” Shkreli was sent to a federal jail in Brooklyn.
The time Shkreli spent in prison will be credited to his seven-year sentence. The prosecutors had sought a 15 year sentence. The minimum sentence for Shkreli’s crimes is 18 months.
Who is Shkreli? 
Shkreli began working on Wall Street at age 17 before establishing his own hedge fund at age 23. He later taught himself biology and co-founded a biotechnology firm, Retrophin Inc. After leaving Retrophin, he founded another biotech company called Turing Pharmaceuticals. 
Turing Pharmaceuticals purchased the rights to manufacture and sell the drug Daraprim, which is the only FDA-approved treatment for toxoplasmosis infection, according to The Guardian. Some people, including some AIDS patients, cancer patients and in utero fetuses, are at risk of dying due to toxoplasmosis infection. 
Shkreli received media attention when the company raised the retail price of Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per pill. A House of Representatives oversight committee also subpoenaed Shkreli in 2016 as part of an investigation into accusations of profiteering. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md) said Turing earned $98 million in revenue from the drug, while it cost the company $1 million to manufacture. 
At the hearing, Shkreli invoked the fifth amendment, which gives people the right to avoid self-incrimination. The House committee investigation was unrelated to the fraud charges.

27421,2018-03-10,"Florida passes law raising minimum age to purchase guns, bans bump fire stocks","Florida enacted new gun control measures on Friday when Governor Rick Scott signed Senate Bill 7026 into law. The measures include: raising the legal age for purchasing guns from 18 to 21; banning the import, sale, transfer or possession of bump fire stocks; and prohibiting people deemed “mentally defective” or those who have been ""committed to a mental institution"" from purchasing or owning a gun ""until certain relief is obtained"" through a petition to the Department of Law Enforcement.
 
  The law is called the ""Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act,"" named after the shooting at the school of the same name last month that killed 17 people. Scott said, “Every student in Florida has a right to learn in a safe environment” and the legislation “will help us achieve that.” 
The National Rifle Association (NRA) filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida, alleging the age minimum imposed by the new law violates the second and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action said, ""Securing our schools and protecting the constitutional rights of Americans are not mutually exclusive.""
Other changes required by the new law include:

	Funding a $67 million provision for the “Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program,” which would allow sheriffs to arm some teachers and give them authority to act as law enforcement “to the extent necessary to prevent or abate an active assailant incident on a school premises.” Aaron Feis was a coach at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who shielded students with his own body and died in the February shooting.
	Revising the mandatory waiting period between purchase and delivery of most firearms to three days. Florida previously had a three-day waiting period for handgun purchasers who did not have a concealed weapons permit. 
	Implementing a “suspicious activity reporting tool that allows students and the community to relay information anonymously concerning unsafe, potentially harmful, dangerous, violent, or criminal activities, or the threat of these activities, to appropriate public safety agencies and school officials.”
	Providing educational programs, mental health treatment and residential services for students with “severe emotional disturbance.”

The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent for the fifth consecutive month, as the new jobs were offset by 806,000 people entering the workforce. 
Average hourly earnings for private, non-farm jobs increased by 2.6 percent compared with the same period last year. It was a 4 cent increase since January, to an average hourly wage of $26.75. 
The average work week was at 34.5 hours, an increase of 0.1 hours.
In February, there were about 6.7 million unemployed people (those who have actively looked for work in the past four weeks), and 373,000 so-called “discouraged workers” (those who are not looking for work because they think there are no available jobs for them). That represents a decrease of 29 percent since the same period last year. There were an additional 1.2 million people who had sought employment within the last year but stopped looking because they were attending school, had family responsibilities or other reasons.
Two weeks ago, the Federal Reserve estimated that “the labor market in early 2018 appears to be near or a little beyond full employment.” It said unemployment was “somewhat below most estimates of its natural rate,” in its Feb. 23 report.

27427,2018-03-10,India’s Supreme Court rules to allow passive euthanasia,"India’s Supreme Court ruled on Friday that individuals have the right to refuse or withdraw life saving medical treatment, a decision that is also termed “passive euthanasia.” The five-member court also ruled individuals have the right to specify their wishes in an advance medical directive, or a “living will,” to be enacted in the event the individual enters into a vegetative state and loses the capacity to make decisions. 
The court specified that family members of terminally ill patients can seek passive euthanasia for a patient by petitioning the court, which would then appoint a committee of doctors to evaluate the necessity of the petition. 
“Passive euthanasia” can include turning off life-support machines, not administering life-extending drugs or not performing life-extending operations. 
The case was brought before the Supreme Court in a petition from non-governmental organization “Common Cause.”  
All forms of euthanasia were illegal in India prior to a court ruling in 2011, which established that in exceptional circumstances terminally ill patients could be removed from life support following a doctor’s petition and the court’s approval, BBC reported.
Indian courts have rejected appeals to allow active euthanasia, or acts that aid in a person killing him or herself. Attempted suicide is currently punishable by up to one year in jail under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, but, according to the Times of India, the government is considering revising that law.

27576,2018-03-12,"Trump discusses North Korea, economy, drugs at Pennsylvania campaign rally","President Donald Trump spoke at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday, in support of his policies and of Republican candidate Rick Saccone, who is running for a House seat. Saccone is running against Democrat Conor Lamb in a special election on Tuesday for Rep. Tim Murphy's seat in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District. Murphy, a Republican, had served the district since 2003 and resigned from the House last October after admitting to an extramarital affair.
In addition to remarks on why he supports Saccone over Lamb in the special election, Trump also mentioned the following topics during his approximately 75-minute speech:

	North Korea, including that he planned to meet with the country’s leader;
	the economy, including jobs and the stock market;
	trade, including tariffs on steel and aluminum;
	immigration, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, “sanctuary cities” and his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border;
	drugs, including the death penalty or life in prison as possible sentences for drug dealers;
	crime, including the MS-13 gang;
	tax reform;
	healthcare mandates;
	a campaign slogan for his potential 2020 candidacy for president, “Keep America Great”;
	his thoughts on how the media reports on him;
	individuals he considers to be ""good"" or ""bad.”

The rally was held in an airplane hangar in Moon Township. The township is about 17 miles west and north of Pittsburgh. 
Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, with an estimated population of 707,100, has about 17,000 steelworkers, according to Fox News. In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump won the district by about 20 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
Republican groups outside of Pennsylvania have spent more than $10 million on the 18th district congressional race. Lamb has raised about $4 million, according to the Federal Elections Commission. TribLive reported that there was about $1.6 million in “outside spending” for ads supporting Lamb or against Saccone. In eight elections there for the House, the last two of which were uncontested, Murphy won by at least 15 percentage points each time. 
Murphy resigned last year after admitting to the affair, and after reports that he had allegedly discussed the option of abortion with the woman with whom he had the affair. Murphy had campaigned against abortion.

Among other things, the report describes “Russian cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions in 2015-2016 and their use of social media to sow discord.” It found “no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.” 
The full 150-page draft report analyzes: alleged Russian measures “targeting” the U.S. election; the U.S. government response; alleged links between Russians and the Trump and Clinton campaigns; and supposed disclosures of classified information. According to the summary, the report includes findings from the committee’s investigation and recommendations for Congress and the executive branch.
The report contains more than 40 findings describing:

	A “pattern of Russian attacks” on America’s European allies
	A “lackluster pre-election response to Russian active measures”
	Agreement with the U.S. Intelligence Community’s assessments, except for “Putin’s supposed preference for candidate Trump”
	Finding “no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians”
	An outline of how “anti-Trump research” was sent to Hillary Clinton’s campaign  from “Russian sources”

27670,2018-03-13,British PM says ‘highly likely’ Russia responsible for nerve agent poisoning,"British Prime Minister Theresa May addressed Members of Parliament in the House of Commons on Monday, saying it was “highly likely that Russia was responsible” for the March 4 poisoning and attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. May called the attack “an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk."" Russia has denied responsibility.
According to May, the U.K.’s Porton Down laboratory positively identified the chemical used in the attack as a “Novichok” nerve agent. She said that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had contacted the Russian ambassador, requiring Moscow to provide a ""full and complete disclosure of the Novichok program to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons” by the end of Tuesday. (More below)
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the incident was “another information and political campaign based on provocation.” A representative for Russia’s upper parliament’s foreign affairs committee, Vladimir Dzhabarov, said, “This already is not our issue,” adding that Skripal “had access neither to our secrets nor facilities.”
The nerve agent
The group of Novichok chemicals (Russian for “newcomer”) were produced in the 1970s and 1980s by Soviet Union laboratories. The agents block the breakdown of a neurotransmitter that controls muscular contractions, which leads to respiratory and cardiac arrest, according to Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who helped develop the chemicals and who spoke to investigators following the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
BBC reported that the agents may come in liquid form, and The New York Times reported the chemicals are powders.
The victims
Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a park bench outside a shopping mall in the British town of Salisbury. Sergei Skripal was once a colonel with a Russian military intelligence service. He was jailed in 2006 for providing information to the British intelligence service M16, according to Russian state media accounts of a closed hearing. He was released in 2010 as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI, CNN reported. Both Skripals remain hospitalized in critical condition.
Nearly two dozen people, including emergency workers, were given medical treatment following the poisoning. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who came into contact with the nerve agent, was hospitalized and remains in serious condition. He has been able to speak with visitors, according to CNN.
Update: On Wednesday, May said Britain would expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to the attack, saying it represented ""an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom.”

27792,2018-03-14,Lamb claims victory in Pennsylvania special House election,"Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory against Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania’s special election for a U.S. House seat, with some absentee votes left to be counted. As of Friday, Lamb was in the lead by 627 votes, with 49.8 percent of the vote compared to 49.6 percent for Saccone, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State. Lamb declared victory in a speech to supporters late Tuesday night, saying “It took a little longer than we thought, but we did it.” Saccone has not conceded. A recount can be called if the margin of victory is 0.5 percentage points or less, according to The Washington Post.
The election was to fill the U.S. House of Representatives seat for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District until the November 2018 general election. The seat has been vacant since Republican Rep. Tim Murphy resigned last October after admitting to an extramarital affair. 
Polls closed at 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday. Approximately 230,000 total votes were cast. About 500 provisional, military and absentee ballots remained to be counted, according to county election officials. The Washington Post said the final ballots would be counted by Tuesday of next week. The earliest the state could make results official is March 26, the director of the Office of Communications and Press at the Pennsylvania Department of State, Wanda Murren, confirmed. Murren added that the official result may not be available until after April 2.
Lamb, 33, is a Marine veteran and former federal prosecutor. Saccone, 60, is an Air Force veteran, former college instructor, and currently holds a seat in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives.
During the campaign, Lamb said he did not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). He also said he does not support the tax reform bill passed last December, and that he supports steel tariffs, gun rights, abortion rights and unions. Saccone endorsed Trump's agenda ""from top to bottom,"" according to The New York Times.
Saccone told supporters Tuesday night, ""We are still fighting the fight. It's not over yet."" The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) said it was ""waiting for provisional ballots to be counted"" and was ""not ruling out a recount."" The NRCC asked voters to report any irregularities they may have observed at polling places. 
President Donald Trump endorsed Saccone in the race, and held a campaign rally for him over the weekend. Trump won the district by about 20 points in the 2016 presidential election.
Lamb raised $3.9 million for the campaign, and groups outside the state spent about $2 million supporting his candidacy. Saccone raised about $0.9 million and outside groups, including the NRCC, spent at least $10.7 million to support his campaign.
Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District has an estimated population of 707,100, including about 17,000 steelworkers, according to Fox News, and about 87,000 voters from union households, according to The Associated Press.
In February, Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled to draw new congressional districts in the state, which includes redrawing the 18th district after Tuesday’s special election. These district changes would be implemented in the 2018 general election if the Pennsylvania court’s ruling is upheld against a legal challenge submitted by the speaker of the state’s house of representatives to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Republicans currently hold a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, occupying 238 of 435 seats. Democrats hold 193 seats, and there are no independents. There are four vacancies, including Pennsylvania’s 18th district seat.

No one was killed. Hamdallah was not injured and said seven of his bodyguards were wounded. PA General Intelligence Chief Majed Faraj was also in the convoy and not injured. 

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. PA Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh said Hamas would be held responsible. Hamas governs Gaza, and the PA governs the West Bank.
Hamas said it “condemns” the ""crime of targeting"" Hamdallah, saying the attack was part of an attempt to destabilize security in Gaza and harm efforts towards ""national unity."" 
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh reportedly spoke with Hamdallah on the phone, telling him there would be an investigation. A Hamas security official said multiple people had been arrested in connection with the explosion.
Three of the vehicles in the convoy were damaged, some with windows blown out and airbags deployed. According to Palestinian news outlet WAFA, the bomb that exploded was buried about 6 1/2 feet (2 meters) below the ground. After the attack, Hamdallah took a tour of a new wastewater treatment plant in Gaza and then returned to Ramallah in the West Bank.
Hamas has governed Gaza since 2007, when it took over power from the PA after an armed conflict, and the PA governs the West Bank. Last year, Egypt helped negotiate a ""reconciliation"" agreement between Hamas and Fatah, the party that leads the PA. Under the agreement, Hamas had agreed to give control of Gaza to the PA in December 2017; this has not taken place.

Tillerson is a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil who became Secretary of State in February of last year. Pompeo is an Army veteran and a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

27860,2018-03-15,"UK to expel 23 Russian diplomats, take measures in response to Salisbury attack","On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced measures the country would take against Russia, including the expulsion of 23 diplomats, in response to the March 4 poisoning of former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. According to British intelligence, the two were poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent originally created by the Soviet Union, while in Salisbury, England. May said Russia gave “no explanation” for the presence of Novichok after the U.K. requested such information be provided by midnight Tuesday. Russia denied responsibility for the attack.
During her announcement to parliament, May repeated the government’s conclusion that either Russia was directly responsible for the attack or it could have ""lost control"" of the nerve agent, which allowed others access to it. She said, “There is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian State was culpable for the attempted murder of Mr. Skripal and his daughter — and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury, including Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom.”
The Russian Embassy to the U.K. issued a statement saying May's measures to ""punish"" Russia were made ""under the false pretext"" of Russia's alleged involvement in the poisoning. The Russian Foreign Ministry also said it had been prepared to cooperate with an investigation under the framework of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, had Britain pursued an investigation there. The statement added that the ""hostile"" measures Britain planned to take were ""unacceptable,"" and that Russia's ""response measures will not be long in coming.""
May said the U.K. had identified 23 Russian diplomats as “undeclared intelligence officers” and they would be expelled under the terms of the Vienna Convention. She said the diplomats have one week to leave Britain, noting it was the biggest expulsion in over 30 years and that it ""reflects the fact that this is not the first time that the Russian State has acted against"" the U.K.
Prior to May announcing the measures, Russian President Vladimir Putin said through a spokesman: ""Moscow won't accept absolutely unfounded accusations against it, which are not substantiated by any evidence, and won't accept the language of ultimatum.""
In addition to expelling diplomats, the measures announced by May included:

	revoking Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s invitation to visit the U.K.;
	freezing Russian state assets when evidence indicates they may be used to “threaten the life or property” of people in the U.K.;
	increasing checks on private flights, customs and freight;
	granting U.K. border agents the authority to detain people suspected of ""hostile state activity,"" not just terrorism;
	“strengthen[ing] powers to impose sanctions in response to the violation of human rights"";
	Ministers or Royals not visiting Russia for this year’s FIFA World Cup.

On Wednesday, U.K. officials met with NATO and the U.N. Security Council to discuss the attack and “pus[h] for a robust international response,” according to May.

27863,2018-03-15,Duterte: Philippines withdrawing from International Criminal Court treaty,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said in a statement Wednesday that the country was immediately withdrawing from the Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the International Criminal Court (ICC). He said the withdrawal was due to ""baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks"" by U.N. officials, and the ICC not following due process and the presumption of innocence. About a month ago, the ICC opened a preliminary investigation into thousands of deaths related to a police campaign against drug dealers in the Philippines.
Last year, Philippine lawyer Jude Sabio filed a complaint with the ICC accusing Duterte and 11 of his associates of crimes against humanity, according to The Washington Post.
The ICC tries people for ""genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression,"" according to its website. The ICC can investigate and prosecute these crimes in a country when local authorities do not. Duterte spokesman Harry Roque said local authorities will investigate crimes and that there is no need for ICC involvement.
Police have said they have killed about 4,100 drug dealers who violently resisted arrest. Police said they were not involved in about 2,300 drug-related homicides, some of which are unsolved. Since Duterte was elected president in 2016, an estimated 12,000 Filipinos have been killed by police or ""men on motorbikes,” the Post reported.
The Philippines ratified the Rome Statute in 2011, thus subjecting itself to the ICC’s jurisdiction. The statute says withdrawal from the agreement takes effect a year after the U.N. secretary general receives a written request to leave. Duterte said in his statement this would not apply to the Philippines as ""there appears to be fraud in entering [into] such [an] agreement."" His legal counsel said because Philippines' entry into the Rome Statute was not announced in the country’s official gazette, it did not apply.

27868,2018-03-15,Facebook removes Britain First pages,"On Wednesday, Facebook announced it had removed Britain First’s Facebook page and the pages of two of its leaders, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen. The British political organization supports a ban of Islam within the country, according to its website. Facebook said the pages had content ""designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups.” The company stated that posts to the three pages had ""repeatedly broken"" its ""Community Standards."" Britain First’s website says the organization “rejects racial hatred in all its forms.”
Facebook said it gave the pages’ administrators a ""written final warning,"" and that the administrators ""continued to post content that violates our Community Standards."" Some of the posts on the three pages included a photograph of Golding and Fransen with a caption of ""Islamophobic and Proud,"" and another caption that compared Muslim immigrants to animals, BBC reported.
Regarding its decision, Facebook said, ""We are an open platform for all ideas and political speech goes to the heart of free expression."" It added that ""political views can and should be expressed without hate. People can express robust and controversial opinions without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are.""
Before its removal from Facebook, more than two million people had liked the Britain First page. British Prime Minister Theresa May said she supported Facebook's action. Twitter suspended Golding’s and Fransen's accounts in December.
This month, Golding and Fransen were found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. They had posted videos online, one showing Fransen visiting houses where, according to prosecutors, she believed Muslim defendants from a rape trial were hiding. In the video, she insulted some men who came to the door. A judge sentenced Golding to 18 weeks in prison, and Fransen to 36 weeks.
Last November, U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted three tweets from Fransen, one of which had a video with a caption reading, “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” The assailant was not a Muslim migrant.
Britain First is estimated to have about 1,000 members, according to The New York Times.

27957,2018-03-16,"US Treasury sanctions 5 entities, 19 people for ‘malign Russian cyber activity’","The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned five entities and 19 individuals on Thursday for “malign Russian cyber activity,” including alleged attempts to influence elections and reported involvement in the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov alleged that the new sanctions were an effort by the U.S. to influence Russia’s presidential election this Sunday and that Russia was preparing a response.
Thirteen of the individuals and three of the entities the Treasury Department sanctioned were also named in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s February indictment for alleged attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Treasury issued the sanctions under the amended Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), as well as an amended version of Executive Order 13694. It said the sanctions are “to address destabilizing activity emanating from within Russia.” The sanctions block properties and interests in properties within U.S. jurisdiction and “generally” prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with the sanctioned entities and individuals, the Treasury Department said.
The Treasury sanctioned the Internet Research Agency LLC (IRA), Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering, which were also named in Mueller’s February indictment.
The department alleged that a Russian military intelligence organization called the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), also attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. election and was responsible for NotPetya, a type of malware attack that damages hard drive files. Russia has denied responsibility for NotPetya and denied attempting to influence the U.S. election. 
The GRU had been previously sanctioned by President Barack Obama in December of 2016 for allegedly attempting to influence the 2016 election. On Thursday, the Treasury sanctioned six officials in the GRU, four of whom had been previously sanctioned at the same time as the GRU in 2016.
A Russian intelligence organization, the Federal Security Service (FSB), was involved in the hacking of Yahoo accounts in 2014 and “undermin[ing] cybersecurity on behalf of the Russian government,” the Treasury alleged. In February of last year, the Justice Department indicted two individuals from the FSB for their alleged roles in the hacking of data from 500 million Yahoo accounts.
The Treasury statement alleged the FSB has used “cyber tools to target” Russians “critical of the Russian government,” other Russian citizens and officials, former officials from countries bordering Russia, and U.S. government officials including White House personnel.
The June 2017 NotPetya cyber-attack was a “mock ransomware virus,” according to The Washington Post, that affected computer systems of banks, energy firms, government officials, hospitals and an airport in Kiev, Ukraine. The U.S. attributed the attack to the Russian government, and the White House said the attack was “part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine.” 
According to cybersecurity firm Cybereason, the NotPetya attack has cost $1.2 billion worldwide in lost revenue to companies. The White House said it caused “billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the Americas” and was the “most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”
The Treasury Department, in its statement announcing the sanctions, said the Trump administration has sanctioned more than 100 individuals and entities under its “Ukraine and Russia-related sanctions authorities.”

27960,2018-03-16,"Unfinished pedestrian bridge collapses onto roadway in Sweetwater, Florida, killing 6","A pedestrian bridge collapsed in Florida on Thursday, killing at least six people, Miami-Dade police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said. At least nine people have been taken to the hospital. The bridge from the Florida International University (FIU) campus to the city of Sweetwater, near Miami, fell onto at least eight cars stopped at a red light on the road below it. The bridge had been under construction and was not open to pedestrians. Florida Governor Rick Scott said he would meet with local officials in the evening to discuss the situation.
Munilla Construction Management (MCM), the company that was building the bridge, tweeted that its “thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy.” It added that it will conduct a “full investigation” to determine what happened and “will cooperate with investigators on scene in every way.”
A previous tweet by MCM indicated that the section of the bridge had been moved into place on Saturday. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) visited the site on Thursday and later tweeted that workers were tightening suspension cables when the bridge collapsed.
The unfinished bridge was 174 feet (53 m) long and 950 tons (862 metric tons), according to CBS News, and was to be 289 feet long when completed in the first half of 2019. The project was estimated to cost $14.2 million. It was made using an accelerated bridge construction (ABC) method that involved building the 174 foot section on the side of the road and then moving the entire section into place over the road, minimizing the time the road had to be closed during construction.
The bridge was designed by FIGG Bridge Engineers. FIGG said it was “stunned” by the collapse, saying that “nothing like this has ever happened before” in its 40-year history. It said its team “mourns the loss of life and injuries” and its “prayers go out to all involved.”
FIU students are currently on spring break.

27954,2018-03-16,SEC charges Theranos and CEO Elizabeth Holmes with fraud,"The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges of fraud against health technology company Theranos and its CEO Elizabeth Holmes on Wednesday. According to the SEC’s indictment, the company raised $700 million from investors between 2013 and 2015 “while deceiving investors by making it appear as if Theranos” had “developed a commercially-ready portable blood analyzer that could perform a full range of laboratory tests from a small sample of blood.” Holmes settled with the SEC, agreeing to step down as CEO, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing.
Holmes did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publishing.
In a separate indictment, the SEC charged former Theranos president Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani with fraud. He is contesting the charges, according to The Economist. 
The allegations
The SEC alleges that Theranos performed about 12 of the 200 tests it said it performed using its “proprietary analyzer” technology. For other tests, “Theranos used third-party commercially-available analyzers, some of which Theranos had modified to analyze” samples from finger pricking, the indictment alleges. 
The SEC further alleges that Holmes, Balwani and Theranos made false or misleading statements to investors. The alleged false statements include telling investors that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) had field-tested the units, which it had not, and that the company had revenues of $100 million in 2014 when it had revenues of about $100,000.
The settlement
Holmes agreed, as part of the settlement, to: pay a $500,000 fine; return 18.9 million of her company shares that she obtained during the period when she allegedly committed fraud; give up majority voting control of the company; and not serve as an officer of any public company for 10 years. The settlement is subject to court approval, according to USA Today.
The indictment also stated that, “Due to the company’s liquidation preference, if Theranos is acquired or is otherwise liquidated, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until – assuming redemption of certain warrants – over $750 million is returned to defrauded investors and other preferred shareholders.”
Investigations into Theranos
In 2015, Medicare examiners found deficiencies at one of Theranos’ facilities in Newark, California, in the testing of the clotting ability of blood. The test is used to determine the correct dose of blood thinners. Incorrect dosages can lead to internal bleeding or strokes.
Also in 2015, the Wall Street Journal published an article that cited complaints from unnamed employees about the company’s portable blood analyzer. These included concerns about the accuracy of the tests, failures to report test results that could show inaccuracies to regulators, and disclosures that only about 15 tests were performed on the company’s proprietary machines. After the article was published, the SEC began an investigation into Theranos.
Holmes responded to the Journal’s allegations in an interview with the outlet, and a statement from Theranos said the publication’s story was “factually and scientifically erroneous and grounded in baseless assertions.” The company released a number of other follow up statements in response to the Journal.
In the spring of last year, Theranos said it had settled a case with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, agreeing to a two-year ban from blood-testing and agreeing to pay a $30,000 fine, USA Today reported.
The following day, it settled a consumer fraud case, agreeing to pay more than 175,000 Arizona consumers a total of $4.65 million. The consumers had purchased tests in Arizona from 2013 onwards. 
Theranos’ response to the SEC
Theranos neither admitted nor denied the charges. ""The company is pleased to be bringing this matter to a close and looks forward to advancing its technology,"" Theranos’ independent directors said in a statement after the SEC settlement was announced. 
The company is currently developing a so-called miniLab, combining the capabilities of multiple diagnostic instruments.
Holmes dropped out of Stanford University and started Theranos in 2003, when she was 19. In 2014, Forbes estimated the company was valued at $9 billion, and Holmes’ worth was $4.5 billion at the time.

27963,2018-03-16,Trump says he didn’t know the accuracy of his statement on trade to Trudeau,"At a private fundraiser on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly said that he had told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a meeting that the prime minister’s statements on the trade balance between the two countries were “wrong.” Trump added that, “I didn’t even know… I had no idea.” Trump said he then asked an aide to get information about the trade balance. 
Trump said the aide told him the U.S. did not have a trade deficit with Canada, when excluding energy and timber. Trump said he told Trudeau that the U.S. had a deficit of $17 billion per year when including those sectors. 
The Washington Post first reported on Trump’s comments, citing an audio recording it said it had obtained of the event. The outlet reported that Trump made the comments while talking for half an hour at a private fundraising event for Josh Hawley, a Republican Senate candidate from Missouri. Hawley is running against Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).
According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in 2016 the U.S. had a trade surplus with Canada of $12.5 billion, when taking goods and services together. In the same year, when evaluating trade of goods only, the U.S. had a trade deficit with Canada of $12.1 billion. 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. Trade Representative’s figures were “incomplete” and did not include timber and energy.
On Thursday, Trump tweeted, “We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!”
At the fundraiser, Trump also reportedly talked about trade with other countries including the EU, China, Japan, South Korea and Mexico. He also mentioned the House special election in Pennsylvania and his agreement to meet with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Trump’s reported comments
Trump also said at the fundraiser, according to the Post, “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’ Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed.
“... So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’ ‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. … And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.”

28097,2018-03-17,Russian granted asylum in UK is found dead in London home,"Nikolai Glushkov, 68, a Russian who had been granted political asylum in the U.K., was found dead on Monday night in his London home, according to a post on Facebook by Damian Kudryavtsev, a board member of a Russian newspaper, citing “common friends” they shared. The Metropolitan Police said, “whilst we believe we know the identity of the deceased, formal identification is yet to take place.” According to police, a man in his 60s died and the cause of death was “compression to the neck.” 
As a “precaution because of associations that the man is believed to have had,” the Metropolitan police’s counterterrorism unit is in charge of the investigation. 
Glushkov had worked with the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, as a director of Berezovsky’s LogoVAZ car company in the 1990s. Berezovsky was a supporter of Vladimir Putin, then later became critical of Putin and left Russia and entered self-imposed exile in the U.K., NPR reported. Berezovsky was found dead in London in 2013. Police ruled his death a suicide. 
Glushkov was also formerly a director of Russian state airline Aeroflot. In 1999, he was charged with money laundering and fraud and went to prison for five years. After he was released, he left Russia and was granted political asylum in the U.K. 
In 2017, he was tried in absentia in Russia for stealing $123 million from Aeroflot and sentenced to eight years in prison. The airline pursued the case in London and Glushkov was due to attend a hearing on Monday at 10:30 a.m. He did not attend the hearing. 
Two weeks prior to Glushkov’s reported death, two other Russians, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, were poisoned in an attempted murder in Salisbury on March 4. About that case, the police said, “at this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that [the deceased] was poisoned.”

28100,2018-03-17,Protests in Slovakia continue after prime minister resigns,"Around 65,000 people protested in Slovakia’s capital city of Bratislava on Friday, calling for early elections under the slogan “For a Decent Slovakia.” The day before, Prime Minister Robert Fico resigned, following three weeks of protests over the death of the journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová. 

Kuciak had been investigating potential corruption in Slovak businesses, and possible connections between government figures and Italian organized crime. His unfinished report was published in the news two days after his death.  
When Fico resigned on Thursday, he said his ruling Smer-SD party coalition government had a mandate to fulfill its full four year term, which is due to end in 2020. He announced fellow Smer party member Peter Pellegrini would replace him as prime minister. 
One of the protest organizers, journalist Peter Nagy, said “Fico's resignation is just a change of figures” and does “not bring change” because the “new government will still have the same people within it.” He said the protesters “believe that the only way for the public to regain trust in the state is to have new elections.”
A BBC correspondent reported that a group of about one hundred protesters left the main rally and chanted “Fico to prison” in front of government buildings. 
There were protests in 35 cities in Slovakia on Friday, BBC reported, as well as in foreign cities including London, New York and Sydney, according to CNN.
Kuciak and Kušnírová’s death
Kuciak and Kušnírová were found in Kuciak’s apartment in western Slovakia on Feb. 26 after they were fatally shot, according to the International Press Institute. 
Kuciak had been investigating people living in Slovakia with alleged links to an Italian organized crime group called the 'Ndràngheta, some of whom allegedly had connections for members of the ruling Smer party. News outlet Aktuality.sk, which the 27-year-old journalist worked for, published Kuciak’s unfinished work on Feb. 28.
On March 1, Slovak police announced they had detained seven people in connection with the deaths, who Police Corps President Tibor Gaspar said have connections to Italian organized crime. BBC reported that all of the detainees have been released and that there have been no arrests made in the case.
The Slovak government offered a reward of €1 million ($1.2 million) for information about the case that leads to the “capture, criminal charges and conviction of the perpetrators of the murder.”
International nonprofit organization Index on Censorship has also called for an independent investigation into the killings.

28237,2018-03-19,The facts on Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,"Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica, SCL, says data shared with third parties violated platform policies
In a March 16 statement, Facebook announced it was suspending the accounts of the political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, its affiliate Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc. The social networking company said the decision was in response to two violations of its platform policies. The first was Kogan providing data from an app that collected Facebook profile information to third parties — namely Cambridge Analytica and SCL. The second was the parties’ reported non-compliance with deleting said information after they certified to Facebook they had destroyed the data.
The New York Times and The Observer (a weekly U.K. newspaper owned by Guardian Media Group) published exclusive reports detailing the events and a dossier provided by Wylie, who worked at Cambridge Analytica until late 2014. The outlets described the collection and use of the information as a “data breach.” 
Facebook updated its statement on March 17, saying, “The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”
Cambridge Analytica also issued a statement on March 17 saying it had “not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.”
On March 19, Cambridge Analytica suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, shortly before a Channel 4 News report aired in the U.K., according to CNN. Undercover footage shows Nix claiming he met then candidate Donald Trump “many times,” and that Cambridge Analytica did “all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting” for his presidential campaign. The footage also captures Nix discussing potential bribery and entrapment. 
The firm responded to Channel 4’s alleged “use of entrapment and mischaracterization” with a statement saying, “The report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.” The company added that Nix “acknowledges that on this occasion he misjudged the situation.”
About the data collection
According to Wylie, Kogan provided data he collected from more than 50 million Facebook profiles to Cambridge Analytica, which he reportedly obtained from the social network in accordance with its policies. Referring to the 50 million profiles, The Observer said they “mostly” belonged to registered U.S. voters.
About 30 million of the profiles contained information such as user identities, places of residence, friend networks and content that users liked on the platform. Cambridge Analytica used the information to match users to other data and build psychographic profiles, in order to develop campaign ads and other campaign strategies in U.S. elections and possibly the “Brexit” referendum. (Psychographics is market research or statistics classifying population groups according to psychological variables.) About 270,000 users consented to having their data collected; the rest of the data was sourced from app users’ friend networks.
Investigations
Cambridge Analytica is being investigated by three parties: Britain’s Electoral Commission is investigating its possible involvement in the “Brexit” referendum; the British Information Commissioner’s Office is investigating the firm as part of an ongoing inquiry into the use of data analytics for political purposes; and in the U.S., Special Counsel Robert Mueller has obtained emails from company employees who worked for the Trump campaign as part of his investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
On March 19, Facebook said it hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to audit Cambridge Analytica to check whether it retained Facebook user data. According to Facebook, Cambridge Analytica agreed to comply with the audit.
On March 20, attorneys general for Massachusetts and New York announced a joint investigation into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. The attorneys general have reportedly requested the firm to “provide information concerning the potential misuse of user data,” NBC News reported. The outlet said they are also “investigating why Facebook did not tell users or the public that the data was handed over to a third party,” adding that Connecticut and Pennsylvania announced similar inquiries on Monday.
Reported timeline of events
Cambridge Analytica LLC was incorporated on Dec. 31, 2013 in Delaware, as a joint venture between the elections division of London-based SCL and American hedge fund co-CEO Robert Mercer, who invested $15 million in the company. Steve Bannon, who later became White House Chief Strategist under Trump, also invested and worked as vice president of the company’s board. Alexander Nix is CEO of both SCL and Cambridge Analytica UK, a separate entity from the Delaware-based corporation.
In 2014, Cambridge Analytica signed a contract with Global Science Research (GSR), a company founded by Kogan. GSR was hired to do research and collect data from Facebook users. Kogan built the app “thisisyourdigitallife,” which was described on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” 
The app paid Facebook users to take a personality test. Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app, took the survey and consented to sharing “information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it,” according to Facebook’s statement. The cost for GSR to acquire the data was approximately $800,000, and paid for by Cambridge Analytica, according to company emails and financial records examined by the outlets.
According to Wylie, he and a team of psychologists and data scientists employed by the company used the raw data to build psychographic profiles. The company built an algorithm that used the GSR data to “analyze individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behavior,” according to The Guardian. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was asked by British members of parliament if any of the company’s data came from GSR, to which he responded, “[GSR] did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”
In July 2014, Cambridge Analytica consulting attorney Laurence Levy sent an email to Bannon, Mercer and Nix regarding laws that limit the involvement of foreign nationals in U.S. elections. He said American citizens or green card holders should be used “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.” The New York Times reported that “few” Americans were involved in Cambridge Analytica’s work during the summer and fall of 2014, when the company provided services for the John Bolton SuperPAC, and the campaign of Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. The contracts held by Cambridge Analytica were serviced by the London-based SCL Group and “most” personnel were Canadian or European, according to The New York Times. In a statement to the outlet, Cambridge Analytica said, “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.”
By early 2015, Wylie and about a dozen people had left the company. Wylie then founded the firm Eunoia Technologies. The New York Times cited a Cambridge Analytica statement saying the company took legal action against Wylie to enforce intellectual property claims, claiming he engaged in ""what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company."" Regarding his work at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie told the Observer, “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.""
In 2015, Facebook learned Kogan had given GSR’s data to third parties. Facebook’s platform policy allowed the app users’ data to be collected and used to “improve user experience in the app” and prohibited it “being sold on or used for advertising,” according to The Observer. Kogan reportedly violated the platform policies “by passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie,” according to Facebook’s statement. 
Facebook said after it learned about Kogan passing the data to Cambridge Analytica, the platform removed Kogan’s app and required all parties to destroy the information. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all confirmed they had destroyed the data, according to the same statement. 
In 2016, Cambridge Analytica worked for Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) and Donald Trump’s presidential campaigns. The company’s work with the Trump campaign included designing target audiences for digital ads and fundraising events, modeling voter turnout, purchasing $5 million in television ads and deciding where Trump should travel to campaign, according to former campaign officials. In its statement, Cambridge Analytica said, “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided” to Trump’s campaign.
In 2018, Wylie shared a dossier of information containing emails, invoices, contracts and bank records with The New York Times and The Observer. Wylie alleges the Facebook data was misused and that it still exists. He has provided the information to the British National Crime Agency’s cyber crime unit and the British Information Commissioner’s Office. 
The state of Massachusetts will be initiating an investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, according to the state’s attorney general, Maura Healey. 
Media coverage
The outlets that broke the story suggested that Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and others may be guilty of wrongdoing for having provided or misused the information. For instance, the Observer wrote that Facebook “failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information.” It added that the “discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook's role in targeting voters in the US presidential election.” The outlet also described Cambridge Analytica as “the data analytics firm that helped Donald Trump to victory,” and The New York Times wrote that the “breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump's campaign in 2016.” 
Cambridge Analytica claims it did not use the Facebook data for the 2016 Trump campaign. The New York Times and The Observer did not provide data to substantiate this and other implications of possible wrongdoing.

28199,2018-03-19,"Sessions fires McCabe from FBI; Mueller has McCabe memos on Trump, Comey meetings, AP says","On Friday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, less than two days before he was planning to retire. Sessions said he fired McCabe based on a Justice Department (DOJ) report alleging he made an “unauthorized disclosure” to the media and “lacked candor” with investigators about an FBI case involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. McCabe denied the allegations. 
The Associated Press said McCabe wrote memos on meetings he had with President Donald Trump and former FBI Director James Comey, which Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly has. Last May, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate an alleged Russian influence campaign in the 2016 presidential election and “related matters.” Mueller’s team is also investigating whether there was coordination between Trump’s campaign and Russia to influence the election. Mueller’s team has interviewed McCabe, inquiring about Trump’s firing of Comey in May, according to CNN.
In January, McCabe said he would retire as FBI Deputy Director after 21 years with the bureau, and would take earned leave days until his retirement in March. His dismissal before retirement may affect his pension. 
In a statement Friday, Sessions said an investigation by the DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found McCabe “had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media” regarding an investigation into donations to the Clinton Foundation by people Hillary Clinton interacted with as secretary of state. Sessions also said McCabe “lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.” Sessions said the OIG provided its report to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), which came to the same conclusion and recommended McCabe’s dismissal.
McCabe responded to his dismissal by saying he was being “treated this way” because of his actions and events he witnessed after Trump fired Comey, and because he said he would corroborate Comey’s “accounts of his discussions with the President.” McCabe added, “This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.” 
McCabe also said that during inquiries on his behavior, he “answered questions truthfully and as accurately as [he] could amidst the chaos that surrounded” him. “When I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them,” he added. 
McCabe became Deputy Director of the FBI in January 2016. He became acting director after Comey’s firing and until Christopher Wray became FBI director last August.
Comey, McCabe memos
Trump dismissed Comey on the recommendation of Sessions and Rosenstein regarding Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation. In his memos after meetings with Trump, Comey alleged that the president said he “hoped” Comey could “let this go,” presumably referring to an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russians. Trump denied asking Comey to close his investigation of Flynn.
McCabe wrote memos about three in-person and one phone meeting with Trump, according to CNN. McCabe said that on each occasion Trump mentioned McCabe’s wife, Jill, who was defeated after running as a Democrat for the Virginia state Senate in 2015. Trump has tweeted criticism about contributions to her campaign from former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, whom he said was a “friend” of Clinton’s. The FBI said McCabe was not overseeing the Clinton investigation when McAuliffe contributed to his wife’s campaign, and that he had received ethics approvals for her candidacy.
According to McCabe, Trump asked him who he voted for in the 2016 presidential election. Trump denied asking this. McCabe did not vote in that election, CNN reported.
Trump’s tweets, his lawyer’s comments
Regarding McCabe’s dismissal, Trump tweeted Friday saying it was “a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.” He criticized Comey’s and McCabe’s character, adding that McCabe supposedly “knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” Trump did not provide details to support the allegations.
On Sunday, Trump tweeted, “Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me.” 
Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, sent an email to The Daily Beast saying he “pray[ed]” that Rosenstein would follow Sessions’ example and “bring an end to [the] alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.” Dowd first said he was speaking as Trump’s counsel, and later said he was speaking in a personal capacity, according to The Daily Beast.
Also on Sunday, Trump tweeted, “Why does the Mueller team have 13 ... Democrats” and “Zero Republicans?” He added that “there is NO COLLUSION!”

28332,2018-03-20,"Shooter dead, two students injured in Maryland high school shooting","A student armed with a handgun shot and injured two other students at a Maryland school on Tuesday before being fired at by an armed officer who works at the school, according to Saint Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office. The injured students are a 16-year-old female who is in critical condition, and a 14-year-old male who is in stable condition, County Sheriff Tim Cameron said. The shooter, who has been identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, later died in the hospital from a gunshot wound.
The armed officer who shot at Rollins, Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill, is employed as a ""student resource officer"" at the school. He was uninjured after shooting at Rollins, who returned fire. Cameron said Rollins had a previous relationship with the injured female.
The shooting occurred at Great Mills High School in southern Maryland at about 8 a.m. local time, before classes began. Doctors pronounced Rollins dead at 10:41 a.m. The Washington Post reported that it was unknown whether Gaskill's rounds hit Rollins or whether he was struck by one of his own bullets.
Great Mills High School is about 70 miles southeast of Washington in Great Mills, Maryland, and has about 1,600 students. The school was on lockdown for a time after the shooting. After the incident, buses took students to Leonardtown High School, about eight miles away, where parents could pick them up.
Students at the school participated in student protests against gun violence last week. The school has held drills in the past regarding procedures in case of a school shooting. 
The school’s principal, Jake Heibel, said that in February there was a report of two students in a hallway talking about “shooting” and “school,” and that information about a “potential threat at school” was also “circulated” on social media. Heibel told parents at the time that the police had been contacted, and that the “threat was not substantiated.” 
Including Tuesday’s incident, there have been 17 shootings at schools in the U.S. since Jan. 1, according to CNN, including shootings in grade schools through university. CNN’s figure included accidental shootings and “gang violence, fights and domestic violence.” Two of the incidents in high schools, one in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, and one in Benton, Kentucky, on Jan. 23 involved more than two victims.

28274,2018-03-20,Mississippi law bans abortions past 15 weeks gestation; judge temporarily blocks the law (Update),"On Monday, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed into law a bill that bans all abortions after 15 weeks gestation except in the case of a medical emergency or a severe fetal abnormality. On Tuesday, District Judge Carlton Reeves issued a temporary restraining order that blocks the law from taking effect for 10 days. 
The new law is called the Gestational Age Act. The state’s only abortion clinic, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, filed a complaint in United States District Court for Mississippi’s Southern District and is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent officials from enforcing the act. 
The court is considering further actions. Reeves, the judge who issued the temporarily block, said, “a brief delay in enforcing a law of dubious constitutionality does not outweigh that harm, and in fact serves the public's interest in preserving the freedom guaranteed by the United States Constitution.""
Previously, Mississippi law prohibited abortions past 20 weeks gestation. The Jackson Women’s Health Organization did not perform abortions past 16 weeks, according to clinic owner Diane Derzis. 
After signing the bill, the governor wrote on Twitter, “I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child, and this bill will help us achieve that goal.”
The Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based abortion rights group, said in a news release that the Mississippi bill violated a Supreme Court precedent, established in Roe v. Wade, that states may not ban abortions before they are deemed viable outside the womb, including with “artificial aid.” This is typically considered between 24 to 26 weeks gestation, the group said. 
Definitions
The Gestational Age Act defines “medical emergency” as “a condition in which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of a pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition arising from the pregnancy itself, or when the continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” 
The bill’s definition of “severe fetal abnormality” is “a life-threatening physical condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb.”

28268,2018-03-20,US prohibits transactions with Venezuelan digital currency,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order effective 12:15 p.m. Monday, prohibiting anyone in the U.S. from making transactions with any digital currency issued by the government of Venezuela. On Feb. 20, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced the “petro,” a digital currency backed by the country’s crude oil reserves. He said the currency had raised $735 million through a private auction. That figure has not been independently verified, according to CNN. Maduro also announced plans to issue another digital currency, “petro gold,” that would be backed by precious metals.
The U.S. sanctioned Venezuela last year, preventing U.S. citizens or banks from purchasing bonds from the government or its state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). The U.S. also implemented sanctions against some Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, in November of last year, preventing U.S. citizens from doing business with them and freezing their assets in the U.S. 
The sanctions were a response to allegations from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that Venezuelan officials tampered with the country’s Oct. 15 state elections in favor of Maduro’s “United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”
Venezuela’s central bank filings reportedly show the country has $9.4 billion in reserves, mostly held in gold bars, according to CNN. The value of the country’s gold reserves fell 14 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year.
Last year, inflation in Venezuela was more than 4,000 percent, and its traditional currency, the bolivar, lost 98 percent of its value, CNN reported. In November of last year, the country defaulted on a $200 million payment on foreign loans; Standard  Poor’s downgraded its credit rating as a result. 
Maduro is running for reelection in Venezuela’s elections in May.

28271,2018-03-20,Vladimir Putin wins fourth term in Russian presidential election,"Russian President Vladimir Putin, 65, won the country’s presidential election on Sunday for a fourth term as president, receiving 76.66 percent of the votes cast, according to preliminary results reported by Russia’s Central Election Commission. The next most popular candidate, Pavel Grudinin, 57, of the Communist Party received 11.8 percent of the vote, the preliminary results stated.
The Central Election Commission reported the preliminary results on March 19, with 99.83 percent of the votes counted. Voter turnout was 67.49 percent. The election results for the remaining candidates were: Vladimir Zhirinovsky with 5.66 percent, Ksenia Sobchak with 1.67 percent, Grigory Yavlinsky with 1.04 percent, Boris Titov with 0.76 percent, Maksim Suraikin with 0.68 percent and Sergey Baburin with 0.65 percent.
Election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a report that the election was “efficiently” run. “Restrictions on the fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression, as well as on candidate registration, have limited the space for political engagement and resulted in a lack of genuine competition,” the report said.
Putin has served three terms as president, two four-year terms from 2000 to 2008, then a six-year term from 2012 to 2018, after the term length was extended in 2008. When Putin was elected in 2012, he received 64 percent of the vote and voter turnout was about 65 percent, according to BBC. Between 2008 and 2012 Putin served as Russia’s prime minister. Russian presidents are limited to two consecutive terms by the Russian Constitution.

28549,2018-03-21,"At least 31 killed, 65 injured in suicide bomb attack near Kabul shrine","A suicide bomber set off an explosion near a shrine in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Wednesday, killing at least 31 people and injuring at least 65. People had gathered near the Sakhi shrine for the Nowruz holiday, the start of the Persian new year. The bomber was on foot and detonated his explosives after police noticed him, according to an Afghan interior ministry spokesman. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq news agency. 
The shrine has been attacked before, including in 2011 when at least 59 were killed, and in 2016 when at least 14 were killed, BBC reported.
IS and the Taliban have claimed responsibility for at least three bomb attacks in Kabul in the last three months, including a bomb in an ambulance that killed at least 103 in January, an attack on a hotel that killed at least 18 in January, and a bombing of a Shiite cultural center and religious school that killed at least 41 in December. More than 200 people have been killed in IS and Taliban attacks in Kabul since the start of the year, according to Al Jazeera.

28265,2018-03-21,"Suspected bomber in Austin is identified, killed in self-detonated explosion during confrontation with police (Update)","Austin police said the person suspected of setting up or shipping a total of six bombs in Austin and the surrounding areas over the past month is now dead. Austin’s interim police chief Brian Manley said the suspect was killed in a self-detonated explosion after being confronted by police.
Manley said at a press conference around 5 a.m. local time that the main suspect had been identified and followed to a hotel he was staying at by tracking his vehicle. Officers from local and federal law enforcement “took up positions” around the hotel and waited for the tactical team in order to “attempt to take this suspect into custody as safely as possible,” Manley said. The chief said that while the officers held position, the suspect attempted to leave the scene in his vehicle and then drove into a ditch. A member of the Austin SWAT team approached when the vehicle stopped, and one SWAT officer shot at the suspect, Manley said.
“The suspect is deceased with significant injuries that occured from detonating a bomb from inside his vehicle,” Manley said. He added that the police could not publicly disclose the suspect’s identity at that time because he has not been positively identified by the medical examiner and next of kin have not been notified. 
A source from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told Fox News that the bomber was identified as 24-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt. 
Tuesday bombs and explosions 
Law enforcement officials said that two bombs found in Texas on Tuesday were believed to be connected to four previous package bombs that exploded this month in Austin. One of Tuesday’s bombs exploded at a FedEx sorting center in Schertz, near San Antonio, injuring an employee. The other was intercepted at a separate FedEx location about an hour away, the FBI sad. The ATF tweeted that the FBI and Austin police had confirmed a connection between the two on Tuesday and the four earlier bombs. None of the previous bombs had been shipped, police said.
Also on Tuesday evening, an incendiary device exploded in a south Austin neighborhood, injuring at least one person, according to officials with Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Service (EMS). The EMS said a man in his 30s received potentially serious injuries and was hospitalized. The ATF said that no package bomb was found and that it currently does not appear to be connected to the previous bombs in Austin and San Antonio.
Earlier explosions
On Sunday evening, two men on bicycles were injured in the explosion of a device in Austin, the fourth in 17 days at that point, according to the Manley. In a news conference, Manley said, “we are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,” adding that it was “possible” the latest device was “activated by someone either handling, kicking or coming into contact with a tripwire.” Austin police have not identified a motive for the bombings.
The two injured men, aged 22 and 23, were taken to the South Austin Medical Center, where hospital officials said they were in good condition.
Manley told Austin residents not to “handle,” “pick up,” or “disturb packages” that looked “suspicious” or “out of place.”
On March 2, Anthony Stephan House, 39, was killed after a package outside his home exploded as he handled it. The explosion also created a hole in the wall and damaged the front door. 
On March 12, another device left on the front porch of a home was brought into the kitchen where it exploded, killing Draylen Mason, 17, and injuring his mother, who is in her 40s and remains unidentified. The same day in a separate explosion, a 75-year-old woman was injured.
All three of those explosions were from devices in cardboard boxes that appeared to be left outside overnight, according to The New York Times.
No lead suspect
The first three explosions took place on the east side of Austin, and Monday’s explosion took place on the west side of Austin. The victims were a variety of ages and ethnicities – House and Mason were black, the 75 year old woman is Hispanic, and the two men in Monday’s explosion are white. 
Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the ATF in Houston said, “we have a high degree of confidence that the same individual built all these devices.” The fourth device, the alleged tripwire, is “more sophisticated” compared to the first three bombs and “not targeted to individuals,” according to FBI agent Christopher Combs. Manley said “there is no leading suspect at this time.” 
There are 500 law enforcement personnel involved in the case, according to Manley, some of whom came from outside Austin. Combs said FBI profiling experts were arriving in Austin from Quantico, Va. The Houston and San Antonio police chiefs said they would send bomb technicians and bomb-trained canine teams. Manley said officials have conducted 236 interviews to follow up on 435 leads. 
A $115,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the bombings.
Manley also spoke publicly to those responsible for the explosions, saying “I will reach out to the suspect or suspects and ask that you contact us … There are innocent people getting hurt in this community and it needs to come to a stop.”
Austin police said they have received more than 1,200 phone calls about “suspicious” packages since March 12.

28390,2018-03-21,"Former French President Sarkozy detained, questioned on alleged 2007 campaign funding from Libya","On Tuesday, authorities detained former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for questioning about campaign contributions he allegedly received from the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi for the 2007 French presidential campaign. Police have previously questioned Sarkozy in the case and he has denied wrongdoing. Sarkozy, 63, is being held in Nanterre, west of Paris. BBC reported that he may be held up to 48 hours under French law.
Sarkozy’s Republicans party said they support him and reminded people “about the principle of the presumption of innocence that is valid for everyone.”
AFP reported that authorities also questioned Brice Hortefeux, who was senior minister during Sarkozy’s one term as president from 2008 to 2012.
In November 2016, French news outlet Mediapart reported that Ziad Takieddine, a Franco-Lebanese businessman, had said that between 2006 and 2007 he had given a total of 5 million euros ($6.2 million) in cash from the Libyan government to Sarkozy and his chief of staff, Claude Guéant. The money was allegedly given in three suitcases. Guéant denied receiving Libyan campaign financing. 
Mediapart also published a document in 2012 that allegedly showed that Gaddafi agreed to contribute 50 million euros ($62 million) to Sarkozy’s campaign. The document was allegedly signed by Libya’s intelligence chief at the time. Sarkozy sued Mediapart for forgery over the document. According to Mediapart, he lost the case.
Gaddafi’s son, Seif al-Islam, has also alleged that Sarkozy received money from Libya for his presidential campaign and asked that the money be returned. Sarkozy said the former Libyan leadership made the allegations because France’s military had intervened in Libya and aided in ending Gaddafi’s rule.
Investigators are reportedly looking into the two media reports by Mediapart, in addition to a cash transfer of 500,000 euros to Guéant that he says was for the sale of two paintings.
Sarkozy was detained in 2014 as part of a separate investigation into alleged campaign funding violations. Separate investigations into alleged “secret funding” of his 2007 presidential campaign and allegations of trying to influence investigators did not lead to charges, according to BBC. 
Sarkozy has been ordered to stand trial in a separate case for alleged illicit campaign financing during his unsuccessful 2012 re-election campaign. Prosecutors said that Sarkozy spent approximately double the 22.5 million euros ($24 million) limit that is allowed by law during that campaign. They also alleged that Bygmalion, a public relations firm used by Sarkozy, engaged in false billing during the campaign. Sarkozy said he did not know about the false billing. 
Gaddafi, who died in 2011, visited Paris in 2007, and made arms and nuclear energy deals with France, AFP reported. Gaddafi ruled Libya for more than 40 years.

28393,2018-03-21,Trump announces plans to reduce opioid abuse,"President Donald Trump spoke about his plan to reduce opioid abuse in the U.S. at an event in New Hampshire on Monday. Trump said he would: hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for illicit activity and “overprescribing”; increase access to treatment for drug abuse; sponsor advertisements against drug abuse; ensure first responders have access to “lifesaving overdose-reversing drugs”; and introduce “tough” penalties for drug dealers, including capital punishment. 

Trump said the U.S. would “cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over three years.”
During his speech, Trump said the U.S. would provide federal funding for the development of non-addictive pain reducers, aimed to prevent “Americans from becoming addicted in the first place.” He also thanked particular pharmaceutical companies for donating “overdose-reversing drugs” to schools and first responders.
The president also called for a reduction in federal funding for “sanctuary cities,” arguing these jurisdictions release drug dealers into communities. He mentioned one “sanctuary city” that reportedly is a primary source of fentanyl for another area; he did not cite evidence to support the claim that sanctuary cities increase drug rates. Trump said his planned U.S.-Mexico border wall would reduce the influx of illegal drugs. The Washington Post reported that some experts do not agree that a wall would reduce drugs coming into the U.S.
Trump spoke at Manchester Community College in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is among the three states with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths, according to The New York Times.
The president said his comments were based on 56 recommendations from an opioid commission that he appointed last year. Last month, Congress passed a two-year budget that included a $6 billion funding increase for efforts to address opioid abuse. 
Trump’s administration has called for Congress to reduce the minimum amount of drugs that a dealer must have been convicted of selling for mandatory minimum sentences to be imposed. His administration has also proposed a national database to monitor prescription drugs. States have their own systems, and some now share data.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump wants to use existing laws to implement death penalties for “very specific high-level cases” of drug dealers. Trump previously mentioned the possibility of the death penalty for drug trafficking during a Pennsylvania campaign rally for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone, who, according to preliminary results, lost to Democrat Conor Lamb last week.
In the U.S., the death penalty can legally be implemented in cases in which adult defendants have been convicted of trafficking sufficiently large quantities of drugs (twice the amounts listed here), or if they have at least a $20 million per year enterprise in illegal drugs. A senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, Ames Grawert, said there has “never been an execution under the one part of United States law that allows the death penalty as a punishment for traffickers.”

The Washington Post reported that there was an unauthorized disclosure to the press of some briefing materials for the call, including the words “DO NOT CONGRATULATE,” and a recommendation to address the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K. with a Soviet-era nerve agent. The outlet said its sources did not know whether Trump had read the briefing notes prior to the call. 
Trump did not discuss the poisoning attack on the call, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The U.K. has alleged that Russia is “culpable” for the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The U.S., France and Germany agreed with Britain’s assessment. Russia has denied responsibility. The Skripals remain hospitalized in critical condition.
On the call, Trump and Putin reportedly discussed the Syrian conflict, denuclearizing North Korea and “mutual national security priorities and challenges.” Trump described the conversation as a “very good call.” He told reporters after the call, “We’ll probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future.” Sanders said there was no meeting planned between the two heads of state.
On Wednesday, Trump tweeted: “I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts.” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!”
Asked at a Tuesday press briefing if the administration believes the Russian election was “free and fair,” Sanders responded that, “we’re focused on our elections. We don’t get to dictate how other countries operate.” She added that the administration can “only focus on the freeness and fairness of our elections,” saying the White House would “continue to do everything [it] can to protect to make sure bad actors don’t have the opportunity to impact” U.S. elections “in any way.”
Response to the briefing note 
Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called for whoever gave the briefing note to the press to resign. 
Sasse reportedly said, “A president’s staff shouldn’t leak. In cases of principle, you may need to resign. So resign. Do the right and honorable thing if you believe your conscience is compelled to do so and resign your position.” 
Rubio tweeted, “I don’t agree with congratulating #Putin but bigger outrage is this leak that could only come from someone in @POTUS inner circle. If you don’t like the President resign, but this ongoing pattern of duplicity holds potential for serious damage to the nation.”

28571,2018-03-22,"Fed raises interest rates a quarter point, increases 2018 GDP forecast to 2.7","The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it had increased the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a recommended range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. “The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,” the Fed said in a statement. It predicted gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.7 percent in 2018, an increase from its forecast of 2.5 percent in December.
The announcement was made after Jerome Powell led his first meeting as chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Trump appointed Powell to the position. He replaced Democrat Janet Yellen last month.
The Fed said it will make future adjustments to the federal funds rate with the objective of “maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.” It projects federal funds rates of 2.1 percent in 2018, 2.9 percent in 2019 and 3.4 percent in 2020. 
According to the FOMC website, “The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions lend balances at the Federal Reserve to other depository institutions overnight.”
The Fed forecasts 2.4 percent GDP growth in 2019, and 2 percent in 2020. The forecast for core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent for 2018, and 2.1 percent for 2019 and 2020. The Fed forecasts the unemployment rate will be 3.8 percent in 2018 and will decrease to 3.6 percent in 2019 and 2020. 
The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate three times in 2017.

28554,2018-03-22,44 African countries sign trade deal to eliminate tariffs on 90% of goods,"On Wednesday, representatives from 44 African countries agreed at a meeting in Rwanda to establish a trade group within 18 months. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, if ratified by a minimum of 22 countries, would eliminate tariffs on 90 percent of goods and phase out tariffs on other goods. It would also replace regional agreements. Nigeria and South Africa, which account for half of the continent’s gross domestic product (GDP), did not sign the agreement. 
AfCFTA is the result of negotiations between the 55 member states of the African Union (AU), a continental organization. The AU has 1.2 billion people and a combined GDP of more than $2 trillion, according to Al Jazeera.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said he would wait for input from local businesses before deciding on whether to sign the agreement. Other African countries that did not sign the agreement include Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Namibia, Sierra Leone and Zambia.
Three groups in Africa — the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (CMESA), the Eastern African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) — had agreed to the 26-nation Tripartite Free Trade Agreement in June 2015. Talks began the following week to form a trade agreement for the entire continent, according to Bloomberg. AfCFTA is the result of those talks.
The South Africa-based Trade Law Centre (TRALAC), a “public benefit organization,” published a summary of the trade agreement. It said that in addition to decreasing tariffs, the agreement would reduce “non-tariff barriers” to trade, such as those due to customs. TRALAC said the agreement would also provide a framework for dispute settlement and grant African service suppliers access to other African countries’ markets on “no less favorable” terms than domestic suppliers. A second phase of AfCTA negotiations would cover intra-Africa investment, competition policy and intellectual property.
Intra-African trade represents 16 percent of total African trade with all countries, according to the AU. In Latin America that number is 19 percent and in Asia 51 percent, Bloomberg reported. The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimated that by 2022, AfCFTA could increase intra-African trade by 52 percent compared with 2010 numbers, according to Al Jazeera.

28634,2018-03-23,WhatsApp co-founder tweets ‘#deletefacebook’; Facebook CEO Zuckerberg issues statement,"On Wednesday, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a statement updating users on the “Cambridge Analytica situation” in which an app developer allegedly violated Facebook policy to send data from 50 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, a political data analytics firm. Zuckerberg said Facebook had taken actions in 2014 to prevent the unauthorized use of data by apps from “happening again” and that his company had “made mistakes.” He added that “there’s more to do” and announced further steps it planned to take. (Read our previous coverage of initial reporting on the Cambridge Analytica story here.) 

Brian Acton, co-founder of WhatsApp, tweeted on Tuesday, “It is time: #deletefacebook.” WhatsApp is a messaging app that Facebook bought in 2014 for $19 billion. Acton reportedly made more than $3 billion in the sale; he left WhatsApp in 2017. The hashtags #DeleteFacebook, #QuitFacebook and #BoycottFacebook have been used on the social media platform Twitter this week. 
On March 16, Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan and others involved in transferring to Cambridge Analytica some Facebook users’ data in what Facebook said was a violation of its policies. Kogan had developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife,” which was voluntarily downloaded by about 270,000 users who shared information with the app. The app accessed data from the accounts of the Facebook friends of those users for a total of 50 million users.
Since Facebook announced the situation last week, it has lost about $59 billion to its “market cap.” The company’s stock price dropped about 7 percent on Monday, the largest decline in more than three years according to Forbes. 
Facebook has more than 2 billion active monthly users. In 2017, the company’s revenue was greater than $40 billion, with $39.9 billion of that from advertising.
Facebook announces steps to protect data
Zuckerberg said in his statement Wednesday that the company has “a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” He provided a timeline of events related to Cambridge Analytica, including changes to the company’s policies in 2014, when the company limited the data that apps could access from a user’s Facebook friends to only data from friends who had authorized the app. 
The company also required developers to get its approval before requesting “any sensitive data” from its users. Zuckerberg said “these actions would prevent any app like Kogan’s from being able to access so much data today.”
Zuckerberg also provided some of the steps Facebook would take in the future. The steps include a plan to investigate apps that “had access to large amounts of information” prior to its 2014 policy change, and a program to “restrict developers’ data access even further” by removing developers’ access to data from people who have not used their apps in 3 months, as well as other actions. 
Zuckerberg also said Facebook would provide a tool next month for users to see which apps they’ve used and give them an “easy way” to revoke apps’ permission to access their data.
FTC review
Facebook said it was informed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that the commission would send the company a letter this week with questions on the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired from its site, according to Reuters. Facebook said it had not been informed of a formal investigation by the FTC. 
The FTC is reviewing a 2011 consent decree it had with Facebook over privacy practices to see if the company violated the terms of the decree, Reuters reported. If it determines Facebook did violate the decree, the FTC could fine the social media company.
External audit
Facebook had hired an outside forensics company, Stroz Freidberg, to audit Cambridge Analytica’s data, and Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the audit. The U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office requested that Facebook not audit Cambridge Analytica and said the office was seeking a warrant to investigate the company, according to Forbes.

28638,2018-03-23,"McMaster to resign as national security advisor, John Bolton to take role April 9","The White House announced on Thursday that President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, would resign and be replaced by former Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton on April 9. Trump and McMaster both publicly thanked each other. 
Trump tweeted, ""I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job  rather it was the result of ongoing conversations between the two,” according to NPR. Trump appointed McMaster as national security advisor on Feb. 20 of last year.
Bolton served as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under George W. Bush from 2005 to 2006. Prior to that, he served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security for four years. Bolton is a former senior vice president of American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a public policy research institute. He has also been the Assistant Attorney General and served in other public sector positions.

28626,2018-03-23,"French workers strike over proposed state labor reforms, interrupting rail and flight service","French unions went on strike on Thursday and workers protested in French cities over President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed labor reforms to the state-owned rail company and other public sectors. Unions representing air traffic controllers, train conductors, teachers and nurses joined the strikes. The work stoppages led to a reduction in train service (60 percent of the TGV “high-speed” trains and 50 percent of the regional trains), as well as the cancellation of about 30 percent of the flights in and out of Paris on Thursday. Macron’s proposed labor reforms include a plan to cut 120,000 government jobs over his five-year term.
Macron has also proposed maintaining pay for some public workers at its current rate, outsourcing and offering voluntary buyouts to some employees, according to news network France 24. France has about 5.4 million state workers, The Guardian reported. Macron’s proposed reforms for the rail industry include amending contracts for new hires to not include “lifetime job security,” and to provide them with fewer pension benefits than have been available in the past, according to France 24.
About 180 protests took place in cities across the country, according to The Guardian, and most were peaceful. The outlet reported that police used tear gas and water cannons at two demonstrations, one in Paris and another in the western city of Nantes. An average of about one quarter of teachers were striking across France, according to the SNUipp-FSU union.
The date of the strike, March 22, is the 50th anniversary of France’s 1968 protests that included the country’s largest ever strike, and some violent incidents between police and student demonstrators in May of that year.
A poll for the French newspaper Les Échos indicated that more than half of the French population supported Thursday’s strike and more than half of private sector employees opposed it.
Railway unions have planned strikes on two out of every five days for three months from April 3 to June 28, according to The Guardian.
Last week Macron said, “We are going to continue reforming France in depth... with the certitude that our country needs this transformation to make up for the ground lost over previous decades.”
In September of last year, there were protests against some of Macron’s previous labor reforms.
In a poll published Wednesday by market research company Ipsos, Macron’s approval rating was 37 percent, up two points from last month, while 55 percent of people view his presidency unfavorably. That figure is the highest disapproval rating since he became president in May of last year.

28744,2018-03-24,Trump administration proposes reclassifying bump stocks as ‘machine guns’ to effectively ban them,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Friday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) classify “bump stocks” as “machine guns” under federal law, which would effectively ban them. Bump stocks are devices that allow a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger, similar to an automatic firearm. 
Later on Friday, President Donald Trump said he would ban bump stocks “himself” if Congress does not ban them through legislation. He also called for other measures, including the ability to institutionalize people who are suspected of becoming violent, “common sense” background checks for gun purchases, and the arming of teache
A bump stock device was used in the Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people. In February of this year, Trump sent a memo to Sessions directing him to implement new federal guidelines banning bump stocks “very soon.” While announcing the proposal, Sessions said that since the Vegas shooting, banning bump stocks “is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.”
The proposal will now be sent to public comment for a period of 90 days. (Instructions for submitting public comments are available here.)
In 2010, the ATF concluded that bump stocks did not turn a gun into a “semi-automatic” or “machinegun,” which meant they were not prohibited under the National Firearms Act of 1934. The ATF determined at that time that it could not regulate bump stocks without Congress passing a new law. 
Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) has called for legislation to ban bump stocks, arguing that the AFT would not have the legal authority to do so. “If ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting repeatedly that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years, and that would mean bump stocks would continue to be sold,” the senator has said.
Trump’s press conference
At a press conference, Trump said he wanted to discuss “public safety” at schools and in general, adding that after the shooting at a Florida school we “need” to “turn our grief into action.” Trump said he would prohibit bump stocks “himself” even if Congress does not legislate them. He also repeated support for arming some teachers, noting that schools would not be able to hire enough security guards. 
Trump said that “in the old days we had mental institutions… and you could nab somebody like” the alleged Florida school shooter, when authorities or family members notice signs indicating the potential for violence. Trump said such institutions were closed due to cost, and called to explore reopening them as a “halfway” between prison and “leaving him at his house.”
The president also said he met with leaders of the National Rifle Association recently and said the NRA wanted to “do something.” He made the comment in the context of introducing more extensive background checks for gun purchases. Trump also said the NRA members are “doing what they think is right,” though “we have to fight” the NRA “every once in a while.” 
Trump noted that senators were already working on legislation, and said they were going to “strengthen it.”

28733,2018-03-24,"9 Iranians charged with cyber theft, sanctioned by US","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged nine Iranians with cyber theft on Friday, alleging that beginning in 2013 they stole 31 terabytes of documents and data from U.S. and foreign institutions and private companies, on behalf of the Iranian government. The DOJ alleged that the nine individuals worked with the Mabna Institute, an Iranian-based company that contracted with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other Iranian government and university clients. 

In a corresponding announcement, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Mabna Institute, the nine accused individuals, and one additional individual charged in a separate case in 2017 for allegedly stealing data from U.S. entertainment company HBO.
The DOJ said the alleged cyber theft campaign intruded on the computer systems of 144 U.S. universities plus 176 universities in 21 other countries, 47 private sector companies inside and outside the U.S., the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children’s Fund. The alleged campaign is accused of stealing intellectual property, according to prosecutors, including access to academic journals, dissertations and electronic books. 
The alleged intrusions into the universities were part of phishing scams that appeared as emails from professors at one university sending article links to professors at another. The links then required professors to re-enter login information that was then copied, according to prosecutors. The alleged hacking into government and private institutions used “password spraying,” collecting publicly available emails and then attempting to log in using common passwords, the indictment said.
Details of the charges
The individuals charged are: Gholamreza Rafatnejad, 38; Ehsan Mohammadi, 37; Abdollah Karima, 39; Mostafa Sadeghi, 28; Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, 34; Mohammed Reza Sabahi, 26; Roozbeh Sabahi, 24; Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, 37; and Sajjad Tahmasebi, 30. They are all citizens and residents of Iran. 
Each individual is charged with:

	one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
	one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. 
	two counts of unauthorized access of a computer, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
	two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
	one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.

28919,2018-03-26,"US, EU expel Russian diplomats in response to alleged Russian nerve agent poisoning in Britain","The U.S. announced on Monday that it was expelling 60 Russian diplomats in response to Russia’s alleged use of a “military-grade nerve agent to attempt to murder” British citizen and former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the U.K. city of Salisbury on March 4. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that 14 EU member states would be expelling Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning. Canada, Ukraine and other countries announced similar diplomatic expulsions. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack and called the expulsions a “mistake.”
On March 12, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the U.K. had concluded it was “highly likely that Russia was responsible” for the poisoning. The U.K. determined that the poisoning resulted from exposure to the “Novichok” nerve agent, which the Soviet Union originally developed, and requested a response from Russia. May announced two days later that the U.K. had received “no explanation” from Russia and said it would expel 23 Russian diplomats. Russia then expelled 23 U.K. diplomats in response. 
US announcement
The U.S. State Department said on Monday that it was expelling 48 Russian diplomats in the U.S. as well as 12 diplomats at the United Nations who reside in the U.S. The Department also said it was ordering Russia to close its consulate in Seattle by April 2. 
State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the poisoning was a “violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and breach of international law,” adding that the expulsions were made out of “unbreakable solidarity with the United Kingdom.” 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the U.S. actions “make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences.” She added that the U.S. “stands ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian government’s behavior.”
European countries and Canada
Tusk announced that the European Council, over which he presides, agreed with the U.K.’s assessment that it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury poisoning, with no other “plausible” explanation. He said that in addition to the 14 member states expelling Russian diplomats, the European Council “decided to recall the EU Ambassador to Russia for consultations. 
Tusk noted that “additional measures, including further expulsions within this common EU framework” may be announced in the coming days and weeks. 
Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland announced that Canada was expelling four Russian diplomats and denying the applications of three others “in solidarity” with the U.K., and not against the Russian people. “Canada remains committed to dialogue and cooperation with Russia on issues where we face common challenges,” Freeland said.
Ukraine said it was expelling as many as 13 diplomats in response. Germany, France and Poland said they would expel four diplomats each, RT reported. Lithuania and the Czech Republic will expel three diplomats each, while Denmark, Italy, and The Netherlands will each expel two. Croatia, Finland, Latvia, Romania and Sweden will each expel one diplomat, according to RT.
U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted that the “extraordinary international response by our allies stands in history as the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers ever and will help defend our shared security.”
Russian response
Russia’s Foreign Ministry said the expulsions were a “provocative gesture,” and that the charge against Russia is “unfounded.” The Ministry said it had repeatedly requested information on the case from the U.K. and had not received it.  A spokesperson for the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin would make the final decision about a response.
Russian news agency RIA cited an unnamed source from the Foreign Ministry saying, “the response will be symmetrical. We will work on it in the coming days and will respond to every country in turn.”

28845,2018-03-26,What is Russian ‘meddling’?,"The word “meddling” is often used in media reports about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. But it can difficult to understand what it refers to, especially given the spin and biases of the media and the officials involved.
“Meddling” means “to interest oneself in what is not one's concern” or “to interfere without right or propriety.” The word is somewhat imprecise and can be subjective. Used in the context of the Russia investigation, it doesn’t specify what actions Russia allegedly took, and many news reports that use the word don’t state specific actions either. The breakdown below is aimed at filling in that missing information. 
Also, the verb “to meddle” can mean to “change or handle something in a way that is unwanted or harmful,” which could assume that Russia did indeed change the election in a damaging way. As noted below, this has not been determined. The word “interference” may be a more objective term to use, although on its own it also doesn’t specify what was interfered with or how.
In more precise terms, “Russian meddling” refers to the accusations that have been made against Russians regarding the 2016 election, including computer hacking, a so-called “influence campaign” and potential coordination with U.S. citizens. 
While many of the details of Mueller’s investigation and the intelligence agencies’ findings haven’t been publicly disclosed, here is a brief look at what we know based on investigative hearings, official statements and publicly available intelligence reports. 
Note: Many media outlets have stopped using the word “alleged” when referring to Russian “meddling.” This is an important distinction; while some Russian entities have been indicted, they haven’t been convicted, and Russia has denied the accusations. 
Hacking
“Hacking” typically refers to gaining unauthorized access to a computer or network. On Oct. 7, 2016, the U.S. Intelligence Community released a statement saying it was “confident” that the Russian government directed the “compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.”
According to a declassified intelligence report released on Jan. 6, 2017, Russian intelligence allegedly hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks in July 2015 and maintained that access until at least June 2016. The report noted that Russia had also obtained “some” data on “Republican-affiliated targets,” yet said that information was not used in the same way as the DNC data.
In addition to DNC emails, the report said Russia allegedly “obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards,” and these “elements” were not related to vote tallying. In June 2017, a classified National Security Agency report obtained by The Intercept claimed that Russian military intelligence executed a “cyberattack” on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and sent “spear-phishing emails” to at least 100 local election officials before the 2016 election. 
Later that month, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Jeanette Manfra testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the department received reports that some states had experienced “cyber-enabled scanning and probing of election-related infrastructure” that appeared to originate from a Russia-based company.
Note: The intelligence report didn’t include the evidence that agencies used to reach its conclusion. ""This document does not include the full supporting information, including specific intelligence on key elements of the influence campaign,” it said.
Also, the report said that if Russia did “interfere,” it had not been determined if its alleged actions had an impact on the outcome of the 2016 election. 
“Influence campaign”
The Jan. 2017 intelligence report concluded that Putin ordered an “influence campaign” in 2016 with the intent to influence the U.S. presidential election, and that Russia’s goals were to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.” The report stated that the CIA and FBI had “high confidence in these judgments,” while the NSA had “moderate confidence.” 
The report assessed “with high confidence” that Russian military intelligence used a persona called “Guccifer 2.0” and Wikileaks.com to disseminate data associated with the U.S. 2016 presidential elections, such as email accounts associated with the Democratic National Committee and political figures. The report said Russian diplomats also publicly criticized the US electoral process, calling it “unfair.” The report didn’t name specific diplomats. 
It also said “pro-Kremlin bloggers” had created a Twitter campaign called “#DemocracyRIP” on election night in anticipation of Clinton’s victory. The report noted that such “influence” campaigns were “multi-faceted” and that people carrying them out use various means to hide their identity so that their actions can be “deniable.”
The report also mentioned Russian “propagandist” Dmitry Kiselev and a “pro-Kremlin proxy” Vladimir Zhirinovskiy as being part of the alleged “influence campaign.” During his weekly newsmagazine program, Kiselev reportedly described Trump as a victim of a corrupt political system that wanted to prevent his election because of his desire to work with Moscow. The report claimed that Zhirinovskiy publicly announced that Russia would “drink champagne” if Trump was elected, because it would mean Russia would be able to “advance its positions” on Syria and Ukraine. 
U.S. intelligence agencies said the Russian organization Internet Research Agency hired professional commenters to create social media accounts and promote and share stories about Clinton and other political issues. In Nov. 2017, Twitter, Google and Facebook testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Russia’s alleged use of their services. Facebook said it found more than 3,000 IRA-linked ads on its platform. Twitter said it found and removed 2,752 accounts connected to the IRA. Google confirmed that Russian-backed accounts uploaded more than 1,000 videos to its streaming service YouTube. 
Mueller’s investigation recently indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including the IRA.
Alleged coordination between Trump campaign and Russia
On March 20, 2017, former FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Intelligence Committee that the FBI’s Russia investigation at the time included “investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.”
In May 2017, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to head the Russia investigation, his order directed Mueller to investigate any “links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.” 
The word “collusion” has often been used in the press in reference to alleged cooperation with Russia. Merriam-Webster defines the word as “secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose.” Yet “collusion” in itself is not a federal crime, with the exception of antitrust law. The Mueller investigation has not said which laws would have been violated if there was indeed coordination between the Russian government and Trump campaign officials. 
One criminal law that could potentially apply is 52 U.S.C. 30121, which states it’s illegal for a foreign national to make a “contribution or donation of money or other thing of value” to a campaign, as well as a crime for a U.S. citizen to “solicit, accept, or receive” this type of contribution.
The investigation could also be looking into 18 USC Sec. 371, which refers to “conspiracy” by two or more persons to violate a U.S. law or “to defraud the United States.” Coordinating the purchase of political ads for an election, may also be illegal, as noted in the Context cited above. 
The Department of Justice and Mueller’s investigation haven’t said what specifically prompted the investigation into the Trump campaign. The press has reported several instances in which Trump’s campaign allegedly had contact or business dealings with Russian officials. For example:

	Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has also been indicted by Mueller, resigned in Feb. 2017 after he reportedly discussed lifting sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador without approval by Trump or Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts.
	During Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ confirmation hearing, he had said he did not recall having contact with any Russian officials during the presidential campaign. Media outlets later reported that he had met with the Russian ambassador on two occasions.
	After the investigation began, Donald Trump Jr. disclosed that he, Jared Kushner and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort had a meeting in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer who promised to provide compromising information on Clinton. (Read more about that meeting here.)

Putin’s response
Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the various accusations of interference and hacking. He has also said that the Russian companies that were indicted by Mueller’s team don’t represent the Russian government or Russian authorities. When asked whether he would extradite Russian citizens indicted by Mueller, Putin said, “never.”
Asked about the indictments in an interview with NBC this month, Putin said, “They could just as easily have been the names of some Americans who are sitting here and interfering in your own political process.”
“You mentioned a number of names, some individuals. And you’re telling me that they’re Russians. So what?"" Putin said. ""Maybe being Russian, they’re actually working for some kind of American company. Perhaps one of them used to work for one of the candidates. I have no idea.""
Trump’s response
Trump and the White House have denied the presidential campaign had any coordination with Russia. On March 17 of this year, Trump tweeted, “The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.”
In February, when Mueller’s investigation announced the indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities, Rosenstein said they did not allege that any American was a “knowing participant” in illegal activity, or that the actions “altered the outcome of the 2016 election.” 
On March 22, the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a Republican-drafted report on the committee's findings in its investigation into alleged Russia's interference. The following day, Trump tweeted: 
“House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign  Russia. (2)  The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.”",Context|Elections|Politics|Russia|Trump|World,Europe|USA,,Donald Trump|James Comey|Jeff Sessions|Robert Mueller|Rod Rosenstein|Vladimir Putin,Washington,,world_news,publish
28848,2018-03-26,"An estimated 180,000 attend Washington ‘March for Our Lives’ demonstration for ‘school safety,’ gun legislation","On Saturday, an estimated 180,000 people demonstrated in Washington for “school safety” and gun control legislation as part of a “March for Our Lives” event organized by students, including some from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. A former student there allegedly used an AR-15 rifle to kill 17 and injure at least 14 at the school on Feb. 14. Demonstrations were planned for about 800 cities around the world and counter-demonstrations took place in some cities.
The primary march took place in Washington, D.C. Some demonstrators there held signs, including ones expressing criticism of President Donald Trump and one that read, “Graduations, not funerals!” Students, some as young as 9, from Parkland and elsewhere spoke to the crowd. Some in the crowd chanted sayings such as “Vote them out!” 
Demonstrations were planned in 390 of 435 U.S. congressional districts, The New York Times reported. Other cities where demonstrations were planned included Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Berlin, London, Mumbai, Rome, Sydney and Tokyo. 
There were counter-demonstrations in a number of cities, including in Washington, where about 30 gun rights supporters gathered in front of the FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to The Associated Press (AP). Counter-demonstrators in Washington held signs that read “Armed Victims Live Longer” and “Stop Violating Civil Rights,” among others. In Salt Lake City, Utah, hundreds of demonstrators held signs such as “AR-15’s EMPOWER the people,” and “Criminals love gun control,” The New York Times reported.
“Crowd science researchers” from Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated about 180,000 people attended the Washington event, according to The New York Times. The event was scheduled for 12 p.m. EDT on Pennsylvania Avenue, and the National Park Service had a permit for 500,000 people to potentially attend.
Also on Saturday, more than 20,000 people gathered in a park less than a mile from the high school in Parkland, Florida. Some protesters chanted messages such as “Enough is enough,” while others held signs, including ones that read, “Our ballots will stop bullets” and “Why do your guns matter more than our lives?,” AP reported. At the event, 17 students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School stood on stage silently, representing the students who died in the Feb. 14 attack, according to The New York Times.
White House spokesman Zach Parkinson said, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.” He mentioned the Fix NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) Act and the STOP School Violence Act that Trump signed into law on Friday as part of a spending bill (find more details here). Parkinson also mentioned the Justice Department’s proposal on Friday to ban bump stocks, which are devices that allow a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger, similar to an automatic firearm.
Trump was in Florida at the Trump International Golf Club at the time of the demonstration. Some members of Congress were out of town on spring recess.
March for Our Lives petition and other viewpoints
On the March for Our Lives website, there is a petition that says “we support the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms, as set forth” in the U.S. Constitution, adding that “with that right comes responsibility.” The petition then called for: 1) a law to ban the sale of “assault weapons like the ones used in” the Las Vegas and Parkland shootings, 2) a prohibition of the sale of “high-capacity magazines,” and 3) a requirement of background checks for every gun sold, including online and at gun shows.
The March for Our Lives mission statement said “school safety is not a political issue” and added, “there cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children.”
Kyle Kashuv, a Parkland student who has met with Trump and some lawmakers, said he wouldn’t be “marching” because he disagreed with the “message” of the event, that he said was “anti-gun.” He called for people to “look at all the facts” and “all the sides.”
Event supporters
Some groups involved in the march included Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, Move On, the Women’s March, Planned Parenthood and Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence.
Celebrities George Clooney, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attended the march. Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson and others performed.
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft lent his team’s plane to Parkland students to travel to Washington. Delta Air Lines also provided free travel for Parkland students to travel there.
Clooney donated $500,000 to the event. Steven Spielberg and Taylor Swift also donated thousands of dollars, Fox News reported.

28953,2018-03-27,FTC confirms investigation into Facebook privacy practices; Senate committee calls on Zuckerberg to testify,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that it had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook following media reports that it said raise “substantial concerns about the privacy practices” of the company. The FTC’s confirmation follows media reports and statements from Facebook that it suspended the accounts of the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica after it reportedly violated the social media company’s policies, receiving data from 50 millions users. 
Read more about Cambridge Analytica’s reported violations here, and an update on steps Facebook says it has taken to address the situation here.
Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to the public for the incident, calling it “a breach of trust,” and saying he was “sorry we didn’t do more at the time.” He said Facebook was “taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
The acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, Tom Pahl, said the commission is “firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers,” including “enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises” or engage in “acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act.”
Senate committee hearing
Also on Monday, the chairman for the Senate Judiciary Committee announced it had summoned Zuckerberg to testify before Congress on data privacy. The chairman, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), said Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey were also called to testify at the hearing, which is scheduled for April 10.
The hearing will be on the “future of data privacy in social media,” and will include questions about privacy standards for how social media networks collect data and distribute it to third-party groups, and what steps the companies have taken to protect user data.
On Tuesday, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress, according to unnamed sources cited by The New York Times.
Two other U.S. Congressional committees, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, had previously called on Zuckerberg to testify at hearings. 
Additionally on Monday, a bipartisan group of 37 state attorneys general sent a letter to Facebook inquiring about the company’s role in Cambridge Analytica’s activities and how this would affect the protection of data in the future. 
Facebook collecting call and text data
On Saturday, two days prior to the FTC and Congressional announcements, tech news outlet Ars Technica first reported that Facebook was collecting call and text message information from some Android smartphones that had the Facebook app on them. This information included call times, call duration, and the names of phone numbers of people called or texted.
Facebook said in a statement on Sunday following the report that the data collection was an “opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android.” Users are “given the option to continuously upload” contacts as well as “call and text history” when logging in for the first time, and that they are given the option to accept, decline or learn more. The statement specified that the feature “does not collect the content of your calls or text messages,” and can be discontinued at any point.
A Facebook representative told Ars, “The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it’s a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.”

28956,2018-03-27,The facts on the Stephanie Clifford ‘60 Minutes’ interview,"Stephanie Clifford tells ‘60 Minutes’ about alleged 2006 affair with Trump
CBS’s “60 Minutes” aired an interview on Sunday night with Stephanie Clifford, a former adult film star whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Clifford, 39, told interviewer Anderson Cooper that she had sexual intercourse one time with Trump in 2006, adding that by speaking in the interview she was risking a million dollar fine for violating a non-disclosure agreement. Trump has denied the affair.
Clifford alleged that the affair occurred in Trump’s hotel room in Lake Tahoe in July 2006, after the two met during a celebrity golf tournament. She said Trump had told her he could get her a role on his television show “Celebrity Apprentice.”
White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said on Monday that Trump has repeatedly denied the affair, saying there was “nothing to corroborate” Clifford’s account. “The president doesn’t believe any of the claims Ms. Daniels made in the interview last night were accurate,” Shah said. He also said Clifford’s account was “inconsistent,” given that in January she signed a statement denying that she ever had a physical or romantic affair with Trump, which Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen publicly released.
When Cooper asked why Clifford signed the statement, she said she did so “because they made it sound like I had no choice.” He asked if she meant “legal repercussions,” and she said yes. She declined to discuss whether she had evidence, such as text messages or photos, of the alleged affair.
The Wall Street Journal first published an account of the alleged affair in January 2018, when it reported that Clifford had been paid $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement prohibiting her from discussing her alleged relationship with Trump in October 2016, a month before the presidential election. Cohen, Trump’s lawyer, had reportedly arranged the payment through a Delaware-based limited liability corporation he had established. Clifford said she was not the source of the Journal story. 
Cohen said in February that he did make the payment out of pocket. “Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” Cohen said. His statement followed an allegation that the payment violated campaign finance laws, if it was made by the campaign. Cohen denied Clifford’s claims about the affair.
In the 60 Minutes interview, Clifford alleged that she was threatened in 2011 in Las Vegas after she attempted to sell her story to an affiliate of In Touch magazine for $15,000; the story did not run at the time. Two former In Touch employees told CBS that when the magazine attempted to contact Trump for comment, Cohen had said it would be sued if it ran the story. In Touch published the interview transcript with Clifford this year.
Clifford said that a man approached her as she was putting her then infant daughter in the car telling her to “forget the story.” She alleged the man said, “That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.” When asked if she went to the police, Clifford said did not because she was “scared.”
The law firm representing Cohen sent a letter to Clifford’s attorney alleging that she defamed him during her 60 Minutes interview. Regarding Clifford’s claim of being threatened in 2011, the letter said, “Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred.” The letter called on Clifford to “cease and desist from making any further false and defamatory statements” and to retract previous statements.
On Monday, Clifford filed a lawsuit against Cohen for defamation. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti, filed the suit in California, alleging that Cohen released Clifford’s signed denial while “knowing it was false or had serious doubts about the truth of the statements.”

28959,2018-03-27,Judge denies motion to drop case against widow of Florida Pulse nightclub shooter,"A judge rejected a defense motion to dismiss and a motion for a mistrial in the case against Noor Salman, the widow of the man who shot and killed 49 people and injured 53 at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. The FBI arrested Salman in January of last year on a charge of obstruction of justice and “aiding and abetting by providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization,” according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Salman, 31, has denied the charges, saying she was not aware of her husband’s plan, and pleaded not guilty.  
A week into Salman’s trial, prosecutors informed her lawyers that the shooter Omar Mateen’s father, Seddique Mateen, had been a confidential informant for the FBI “at various points in time between January 2005 and June 2016,” according to court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney informed Salman’s lawyers of this via email on Saturday. 
Salman’s lawyers argued that prosecutors’ delayed disclosure of Seddique Mateen’s role with the FBI had violated her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and a fair trial, respectively. They alleged Seddique Mateen’s role as a source for the FBI was why it did not investigate the possibility that he was involved in his son’s crime. 
U.S. District Judge Paul Byron ruled on Monday that the father’s status as an informant was not relevant to Salman’s case and not grounds for a mistrial. “This trial is not about Seddique Mateen. It’s about Noor Salman,” the judge concluded.

29076,2018-03-28,Russian demonstrators calls for investigation into shopping mall fire that killed at least 64 people,"Hundreds of people demonstrated in the the Siberian city of Kemerovo on Tuesday, calling for an investigation into a shopping mall fire that killed at least 64 people, including 41 children. Some demonstrators suggested the death toll was inaccurate, and requested that the Forensic Examiner's Office verify the number, Russian state news agency Tass reported. According to investigators, DNA tests may be required to identify some victims.
Russian news outlet Novorossia Today described the fire, which occurred on Sunday, as one of the deadliest in Russia’s “post-Soviet” history. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Wednesday a national day of mourning.
Putin attributed the fire to “criminal negligence,” and noted that “it is not right to apportion blame right away.” Russian investigators said the mall's fire exits were blocked and an alarm system was turned off. “Everyone will be checked one by one, from those who issued licenses to those who were supposed to ensure safety,” Putin said. 
The origin of the fire has not been determined. Senior regional official Vladimir Chernov said the fire may have started in the children's trampoline room. “The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,” he said. According to CNN, a preliminary investigation suggested that the fire may have started outside the movie theater. 
Authorities said they detained five people on charges relating to the deaths and safety violations.
The fire occurred at the Winter Cherry shopping mall in Kemerovo on Sunday. Originally a candy factory, the 23,000-square-meter space was converted to a shopping mall in 2013. According to state-run TV, the mall included a bowling alley, a children's center, a movie theater and a petting zoo. All petting zoo animals also died during the fire, according to BBC.

29078,2018-03-28,California sues Trump administration over 2020 Census citizenship question; other states announce plans to follow,"On Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census. The Department of Commerce had announced plans to add a question asking about the respondents' citizenships to the upcoming census the day before Becerra’s announcement. 
According to Becerra’s announcement, the question violates Article I, section 2 of the Constitution, which requires the “actual Enumeration” of all people in each state. He argues that the question may discourage both legal and undocumented immigrants from participating, potentially misrepresenting the number of California residents.
In December, the Department of Justice had requested the citizenship question be added back in to the census in order to “provide census block level citizenship voting age population (CVAP) data that is not currently available from government surveys,” according to the Commerce Department. CVAP figures include data on the citizenship and race of the voting age population.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the information would help to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voting rights and prohibits the use of potentially discriminatory voting measures, such as literacy tests. Ross concluded that “obtaining complete and accurate information to meet this legitimate government purpose outweighed the limited potential adverse impacts.”
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced plans to lead a “multi-state” lawsuit to block the Department of Commerce’s decision. His office plans to file the suit and announce the other cities and states involved, after the Department of Commerce submits its report to Congress on Saturday, according to Reuters. 
Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder also said he would sue the administration to block the question from the census, on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
Last week, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation that would prohibit the commerce secretary from making “major” changes to the census before such changes have been researched and tested. The bill has nine Democratic and no Republican co-sponsors.
The Census Act of 1954 states that the Census Bureau must give Congress the opportunity to “review the proposed subjects within three years, and the questions within two years, prior to the next decennial census.”
The U.S. Census
Required by the U.S. Constitution, the census is distributed by the U.S. Census Bureau to residents every 10 years. The data is used to allocate federal funding for schools, hospitals, infrastructure and other local services. It is also used to determine the number of congressional seats each state needs for adequate government representation. According to the Department of Commerce, a citizenship question was included in the census between 1820 and 1950.
The census is distributed by mail and by workers who go door-to-door to gather responses. According to AP, about 74 percent of households responded to the mail-in census forms in 2010.

29268,2018-03-29,"Trump to appoint White House physician Ronny Jackson to VA, replacing David Shulkin","President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday evening that he would nominate White House physician Ronny Jackson to replace David Shulkin as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Trump said the Hon. Robert Wilkie would serve as Acting Secretary until a new VA director was confirmed by the Senate. Wilkie has been the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, a position that serves as assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense. Trump thanked Shulkin for his service in a tweet.
CNN quoted an unnamed White House official saying that Shulkin’s so-called “distractions were getting in the way of carrying out the President’s agenda.”
In February, the VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on an 11-day trip Shulkin took to Copenhagen and London in July of last year. It concluded the there was “misconduct” regarding the use of VA funds for the trip, and that Shulkin “improperly” accepted a gift. The OIG recommended, among other things, that Shulkin repay the government for his wife’s airfare for the European trip. The VA had paid for her airfare because an email on the “official record” had shown a condition under which Shulkin’s wife would have qualified to have the department pay for her travel. The report alleged that Shulkin’s chief of staff altered the email.
Shulkin said he did not agree with OIG’s conclusions and his attorneys said the OIG’s report omitted “critical facts” that “make clear the Secretary has done nothing wrong.”
In a Wednesday op-ed in the New York Times, Shulkin said that some within the Trump administration saw him as an “obstacle to privatization” of the VA who “had to be removed.” He said he was “convinced” that privatization was a “political issue” and said he had been “falsely accused of things” by people who “wanted [him] out of the way.” He added that he was “proud” of his record and knew that he “acted with the utmost integrity.”
Jackson, 50, is a rear admiral in the Navy who graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch with a Doctor of Medicine in 1995. He served in an emergency medical unit in Iraq and has been a White House physician since 2006. In 2013, Obama appointed him personal physician of the president. Jackson performed a physical examination on Trump in January.
The VA provides health care and other services to veterans and has an annual budget of $186 million and 360,000 employees. About 30 percent of veterans use private doctors outside the VA.

29191,2018-03-29,"Kim Jong Un visits Xi in China, says his country is ‘committed to denuclearization’ of Korean peninsula","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made an unofficial visit to China from Sunday to Wednesday, according to Chinese state-run news outlet Xinhua. Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in his first known visit abroad since taking power when his father, Kim Jong Il, died in 2011. Kim reportedly said, ""It is our consistent stand (sic) to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula.” Kim plans to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April and U.S. President Donald Trump by May.
Kim also said, ""The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace."" He did not specify the terms or conditions for “denuclearization,” or the actions his country would take to that end.
Xi told Kim that the two countries’ ""traditional friendship” is the “precious wealth of both sides."" Xi made four “proposals” regarding relations between the two countries, according to Xinhua. These included: 
1. “high-level” exchanges, such as visits and sending “special envoys and letters to each other”;
2. strategic communications that would “strengthen … mutual trust”;
3. “actively advanc[ing] peaceful development,” and 
4. “cement[ing] the popular will foundation” for “friendship” between the countries, including through youth exchanges.
Xi said “positive changes” had occurred on the Korean Peninsula this year, according to Xinhua. The outlet added that Xi said China’s goal is “denuclearization of the peninsula, safeguarding peace and stability” there, and “solving problems through dialogue and consultation.” According to Xinhua, Xi and Kim talked about “the situation of the world” in addition to that of the Korean Peninsula. 
Xi and Kim held some talks at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square. Afterwards, they attended a banquet with their wives, Peng Liyuan and Ri Sol-ju.
North Korea’s state news agency, KCNA, reported that Kim said, ""It is appropriate that my first trip abroad is in China's capital, and my responsibility to consider continuing North Korea-China relations as valuable as life."" Kim arrived in Beijing in an armored train.
Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi will visit Seoul on Thursday to inform South Korea about the content of the visit.
KCNA said Kim invited Xi to visit North Korea sometime in the future, and Xi accepted the invitation with “great pleasure.”
The Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement by Kim in which he made the comment about being “committed to denuclearization on the peninsula.” He said this was “in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il.” 
In 2005, while Kim Jong Il was leader, North Korea agreed to stop its nuclear weapons development program during six-party talks in China. North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006. In 2009, it stopped participating in six-party talks.
Last year, the U.N. Security Council passed three rounds of sanctions against North Korea in response to its missile and nuclear tests. North Korea’s last missile test was in November 2017, and its most recent nuclear weapons test was in September 2017. Last month, North Korea sent a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and agreed to talks with the country.
US reaction to the meeting
Earlier this month, Trump agreed to meet with Kim by May. Trump tweeted on Wednesday: “Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!” Trump also tweeted that he was “looking forward” to his meeting with Kim.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. was “cautiously optimistic,” and that it considered Kim’s first trip outside of his country a “positive sign that the maximum pressure campaign is continuing to work.”

29200,2018-03-29,Poland agrees to buy $4.57B Patriot missile defense system from US,"On Wednesday, Poland signed a deal with the U.S. to purchase a $4.57 billion Patriot missile defense system. Polish President Andrzej Duda said the deal was Poland’s “introduction into” a “world of state-of-the-art technology, modern weaponry, and defensive means.” Two-thirds of Poland’s weapons systems are from the communist era, according to Reuters. Russia has nuclear-capable missile systems in Kaliningrad, bordering Poland, BBC reported.
Poland increased the rate at which it was acquiring new weaponry after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014, according to both news outlets.
The Patriot missile deal is the largest ever military procurement for Poland. Deliveries of the Raytheon-manufactured system are scheduled to begin in 2022. Raytheon is to deliver two Patriot batteries, each with two firing units. Patriot systems are surface-to-air missile systems for striking aircraft, and cruise and ballistic missiles. The U.S. is deploying anti-missile systems in Europe, and placed a land-based missile defense base in Romania in 2016. 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov said in November that deployments of Patriot missiles were part of a U.S. effort to put missile defense systems around Russia “under the pretext of mythical threats to security.”
On March 1, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual state of the union address, in which he said Russia had developed missiles with a “practically unlimited range” that can travel “an unpredictable flight path.” Putin said the missile would make existing missile defense systems “useless.” 
Poland is in negotiations with the U.S. to purchase additional Patriot missile systems in the future, as well as a “low-cost” interceptor missile and a 360-degree radar, Reuters reported. At least 14 countries, six within the 29-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), have Patriot missile systems. Poland joined NATO in 1999.
On Monday, the U.S. and other countries, including Poland, expelled a total of more than 100 Russian diplomats in response to the March 4 poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter in the U.K. On March 12, British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “highly likely that Russia was responsible” for the attack, which utilized a Soviet Union-developed nerve agent, Novichok. The U.S., France and Germany issued a joint statement with the U.K. agreeing with its assessment.

29197,2018-03-29,Parliament elects Win Myint president of Myanmar after Htin Kyaw resignation,"Myanmar’s parliament elected U Win Myint as president on Wednesday, filling the position after Htin Kyaw resigned last week. Win Myint, 66, is a lawyer and was the speaker of parliament’s lower house until he resigned last week. Parliament selected Win Myint out of three candidates, and he is scheduled to be sworn in on Friday. Kyaw, 71, has been in poor health and the presidency’s Facebook page posted that he resigned to “take a rest.”
Kyaw became president after the National League for Democracy (NLD) party won a majority in parliament in the 2015 elections. After the elections, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the NLD, took the position of state counselor. She was not allowed to serve as president under the country’s constitution, written by the military, because she has children who are not citizens. Win Myint is from the NLD party, as was Kyaw. 
Suu Kyi, 72, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 ""for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights” in Myanmar. The ruling military junta placed her under house arrest in 1989 and released her in 1995.
Formerly known as Burma, Myanmar was under military rule until democratic elections in 2010, when it became a “quasi-civilian government,” according to the U.S. State Department. 
Myanmar has experienced violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. More than 400,000 Rohingya from Myanmar’s Rakhine state left for Bangladesh between August and September 2017.

29195,2018-03-29,"US, South Korea revise 2012 trade agreement, affecting cars, steel, currency","On Wednesday, the U.S. and South Korea announced an agreement “in principle” on “general terms” for amending the 2012 U.S.-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). Under the new agreement, beginning May 1, South Korea would be exempt from a 25 percent U.S. tariff on steel. Negotiators are finalizing the terms of the deal, which requires domestic approval in both countries before being implemented.
Under the agreement, South Korea’s exports of steel to the U.S. would be subject to a quota of 2.68 million tons, about 70 percent of 2015-2017 average exports to the U.S. South Korea was the third-largest exporter of steel to the U.S. in 2016, according to The New York Times.
U.S. tariffs on imports of goods from South Korea would remain the same as under the 2012 agreement, according to Krystal Tan, an economist at the research firm Capital Economics. South Korea is subject to the 10 percent tariff on aluminum that Trump announced on March 1, CNN reported.
The yearly quota of U.S. vehicles that could be sold in South Korea without adhering to local safety standards would be raised from 25,000 per automaker to 50,000. The agreement would remove labeling requirements on American cars that meet U.S. safety standards and do not meet Korean ones. In 2017, no U.S. car company sold more than 11,000 cars in South Korea, CNN reported. A 25 percent tariff on pickup truck imports from South Korea to the U.S. would remain in effect until 2041; it had been scheduled to be phased out in 2021. 
The countries also agreed not to manipulate their respective currencies to make their exports cheaper. There was no mechanism of enforcement related to this aspect of the agreement.
A joint statement between the countries said the agreement “addresses issues related to investment, tariffs, trade in automobiles, and trade remedies.” Negotiators also made “additional progress” in the areas of pharmaceuticals, customs and textiles.
The joint statement added, “This represents important progress in improving U.S.-Korea trade and economic relations, based on their strong and enduring security relationship.”
According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the original KORUS FTA was signed in 2007 and came into effect in 2012. Total trade in goods and services between the countries in 2016 was $144.6 billion. South Korea was the U.S.’ sixth largest trading partner in goods, at $112.2 billion total. The U.S. trade deficit in goods with South Korea was $27.7 billion, while in goods and services it was $17.0 billion. 
In 2016, top export categories to South Korea from the U.S. were machinery, electrical machinery, aircraft, vehicles, and optical and medical instruments. Top import categories were vehicles, electrical machinery, machinery, pharmaceuticals and mineral fuels. U.S. vehicle exports to South Korea were $2.2 billion and imports were $21 billion.

29346,2018-03-30,"Israeli forces kill at least 12 Palestinians, injure 1000 along Gaza border","Israeli security forces killed at least 12 Palestinians in a confrontation with protesters along the Gaza border with Israel on Friday, according to Gaza medical officials. The Israeli forces fired live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters in five locations, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Gaza Health Ministry said two people were killed by tank fire. At least 1,000 Palestinians were also injured, according to the ministry, which did not provide a breakdown of injuries per location.
The Israeli military said it used “riot dispersal means and firing toward main instigators” after some people rolled burning tires and threw rocks at the border fence. Israeli Southern Command Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir said there were “attempts to carry out terror attacks under the camouflage of riots.”
An estimated 30,000 protesters gathered in multiple locations along the 40-mile (65-km) Israel-Gaza border, the local officials and Israeli military said, on the first day of a planned six-week protest. The goal of the demonstration, named “The March of Return,” is to gain permission for Palestinian refugees to return to areas that their families had been displaced from when Israel was created in 1948. Some demonstrators carried tents with names of cities now in Israeli territory written in both Arabic and Hebrew. 
The beginning of the protest on Friday coincided with “Land Day,” which memorializes the deaths of six Arab Israeli citizens in 1976 during protests against government land confiscations in northern Israel.  
Hamas and representatives of other Palestinian factions planned the protest.
About 65 Palestinians were injured in smaller protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Reuters reported.

29286,2018-03-30,Fire at Venezuelan jail leaves at least 68 dead,"A fire in a detention center at a police headquarters in Valencia, Venezuela, killed at least 68 on Wednesday. Families of detainees were waiting outside for visiting hours to begin when a fire broke out. After the fire started, family members reportedly threw rocks at police. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets on the crowd, according to local woman Peguiliana Ruiz, whose son died in the fire. Venezuela’s head prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, said there would be an investigation to “clarify these dramatic events.”
Carlos Nieto Palma, director of Windows for Freedom, a non-profit group that monitors prison conditions, said inmates had set fire to their mattresses in an attempted escape from the facility. Rescuers made holes in the walls for some detainees to escape the fire. Palma said inmates and two women visitors died of smoke inhalation. At least 180 people were held in the facility before the fire, exceeding its capacity of 60, according to lawmaker Juan Miguel Matheus. He said he counted 78 dead. 
The U.N. Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) called for an investigation, to bring those responsible to justice and provide “reparations” to the families of victims. The office said there was “widespread overcrowding and dire conditions” in Venezuelan detention centers, and that “these conditions, which often give rise to violence and riots, are exacerbated by judicial delays and the excessive use of pretrial detention.”
In 2016, 54,758 people were held in Venezuelan prisons with a total designed capacity of 35,562 people, and 33,000 detainees were held in temporary cells with capacity for 8,000, according to the non-governmental organization Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons. The observatory said 173 inmates died in custody in 2016. In the first two months of 2018, 26 died, and 1,016 were on hunger strikes for better conditions, the observatory reported.
OHCHR reported that in Venezuela “millions of people are suffering a lack of food and essential medicines, a shortage of goods including those for personal hygiene, power cuts, and dire housing and living conditions.” It added, “2016 estimates pointed to over 50 percent of the population facing extreme poverty,” and inflation was “reported” at 2,400 percent in 2017.

29283,2018-03-30,Russia announces expulsion of 150 diplomats in response to other countries’ expulsions,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced on Thursday that Russia would expel 60 diplomats from the U.S. and 90 diplomats from other countries, in response to those countries’ expulsion of Russian diplomats earlier this week. 

On Monday, the U.S. announced it would expel 60 Russian diplomats and close the Russian consulate in Seattle in response to Russia’s alleged use of a nerve agent to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. Fourteen EU countries also announced expulsions on Monday. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack.
The U.S. diplomats, 58 serving at the Embassy in Moscow and two at the General Consulate in Yekaterinburg, were given until April 5 to leave, RT reported. The Russian Foreign Ministry also announced it would close the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg by March 31. 
The U.K. announced on March 14 that it would expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning, which was carried out with a Soviet-developed nerve agent, Novichok. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia had given “no explanation” for the presence of Novichok. She said there was no alternative than Russia being “culpable” for the poisoning — either directly or by losing control of the substance. 
Lavrov said the U.K. was “forcing everyone to follow an anti-Russian course.” He asked for consular access to Yulia Skripal, who was poisoned in the March 4 incident and who is a Russian citizen. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said a 1968 consular agreement between the Soviet Union and the U.K. granted Russia the right to meet with its citizens in Britain and offer them advice. 
Lavrov also requested a meeting with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to “establish the truth.” OPCW sent investigators to the U.K. on March 19 to test samples. Results are expected after at least two weeks, the British government said.
At least 20 countries have announced plans to expel diplomats in response to the poisoning. The Guardian reported that countries have expelled more than 130 Russian diplomats in total, while Russian newspaper RT reported that figure at 150. In addition to the U.S., countries that announced diplomatic expulsions include: Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ukraine. Russia said its response to each country would be “symmetrical.”
As of Thursday, Sergei Skripal remained in critical condition; Yulia, his daughter, was improving and was no longer in critical condition, according to the Salisbury division of the National Health Service trust. 
Investigators found Novichok on the front door of Sergei Skripal’s residence in higher concentrations than other locations they had investigated, according to Britain’s counter-terror Police Chief Dean Haydon. Maj. Gen. Alexander Mikhailov of the Russian security agency FSB said if the Skripals had been poisoned at Sergei’s front door, they would have died before making it to the park where they were found unconscious.

29293,2018-03-30,Fox News host Laura Ingraham apologizes for tweet about Parkland student David Hogg,"Laura Ingraham, host of “The Ingraham Angle” on Fox News, tweeted an apology to David Hogg on Thursday after she had tweeted the day before that Hogg was rejected by four colleges and “whine[d]” about it. Hogg is a senior at the high school in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 on Feb. 14. After Ingraham’s Wednesday tweet, Hogg tweeted a list of 12 companies he referred to as “top Laura Ingraham advertisers,” and called on his Twitter followers to contact those companies to encourage them to stop advertising.
At least three of the companies on Hogg’s list later announced they would stop advertising on Ingraham’s Fox News show: Nutrish (a pet food brand owned by Rachael Ray), TripAdvisor and online home goods retailer Wayfair.
The three aforementioned companies issued statements about their decisions. Nutrish said Ingraham’s comments were “not consistent with how we feel people should be treated.” TripAdvisor said, “In our view, these statements focused on a high school student, cross the line of decency.” Wayfair said Ingraham’s comments were “not consistent with our values.”
On Wednesday, Ingraham tweeted a Daily Wire article that quoted Hogg, 17, as saying he had been not been accepted by four University of California schools about two weeks ago. In an interview with TMZ, Hogg said, “It's been kind of annoying having to deal with that and everything else that's been going on but at this point, you know, we're changing the world. We're too busy. Right now it's hard to focus on that.” Hogg said he had been accepted by three universities. He has a 4.2 GPA.
Ingraham also hosts a morning talk show on Talk 1370 AM in Austin, Texas. After Hogg tweeted his list of some companies that advertise on Ingraham’s shows, Ingraham tweeted a response on Thursday. Her tweets said, “I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused [Hogg] or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” adding that “he’s welcome to return to the show anytime for a productive discussion.”
Hogg responded with a tweet that included that he would “only accept” Ingraham’s apology if she “denounce[d]” the way her network had treated his friends and him “in this fight.”
Hogg was one of the student organizers and speakers at Saturday’s March for Our Lives demonstration. He has tweeted criticism of the National Rifle Association (NRA), including saying that “people at the NRA scare and manipulate politicians far more than anyone.” Hogg has also said, “99.9 percent of the people that are in the NRA are responsible, safe gun owners and I respect them for that, joining an organization that wants to support safe gun ownership is excellent.” He added, “What we’re arguing against here are the people that are at the top.”
The New York Times said Hogg was considering taking a year off from school to, in the newspaper’s words, “focus on midterm elections.”
Ingraham has 2.16 million followers on Twitter, and Hogg has about 630,000.

29362,2018-03-31,Judge proposes requiring warning labels on coffee in California,"On Wednesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle rendered a proposed ruling that would require “sellers of ready-to-drink coffee” in California to provide warnings that coffee contains acrylamide, a known carcinogen. The ruling is the result of a lawsuit filed in 2010 by a nonprofit group, Council for Education and Research on Toxics, against Starbucks Corp. and 90 other defendants. 
The suit was based on California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, also known as Proposition 65, which says, “No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning.” Proposition 65 requires warnings for about 900 chemicals, according to the Associated Press. 
Acrylamide is not added to coffee; it is produced in a chemical reaction that occurs when coffee beans are roasted. That fact is not disputed, according to the proposed ruling. 
William Murray, president and CEO of the National Coffee Association, said the amount of acrylamide in coffee is “miniscule,” that coffee “contains hundreds of substances” and that it has been shown to be “a healthy beverage.” In his proposed ruling, Berle said the defendants “did not conduct a quantitative assessment of the risk of cancer from exposure to acrylamide in coffee.”
The defendants have two weeks to file objections. If the ruling stands, the judge could begin another phase of the trial to consider potential civil penalties for up to $2,500 per person exposed to acrylamide in coffee each day over the last eight years.`

29371,2018-03-31,Widow of the Pulse nightclub shooter found not guilty,"Noor Salman, the widow of the man who shot and killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Florida, was acquitted on Friday of providing material support to a terrorist organization, of helping to plan the attack, and of lying to the FBI afterwards. She was released from custody within hours of the not guilty verdict, after spending 14 months in jail. 
Salman is the widow of Omar Mateen, who shot and killed 49 people and injured 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. Mateen, an American-born son of Afghan immigrants, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) before killing people at the club. He died at the scene. 
The FBI arrested Salman in January of last year on a charge of obstruction of justice and “aiding and abetting by providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization,” according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Salman, a 31-year-old who was born in California to Palestinian parents, denied the charges, saying she was not aware of her husband’s plan. A judge rejected motions to either dismiss the case or order a mistrial earlier this week. 
Prosecutors had argued that Salman had helped her late husband look for locations for an attack and gave him the “green light to commit terrorism.” The jury had been provided with a signed confession that said she helped her husband. The FBI had not video or tape recorded Salman’s confession.
The defense argued that Salman had a low IQ and signed a false confession to the police after a long interrogation and out of fear of being separated from her son, who is now five. Authorities had questioned her for 11 hours. The defense also argued that Mateen had concealed aspects of his life from Salman, so she would not have known what he would do.
The FBI also found receipts and cell phone signal locations that showed Salman was away from Pulse nightclub on the day she had admitted to being there with her husband to evaluate it as a target. Prosecutors did not provide evidence, such as online content, that would have showed she supported IS. 
The jury deliberated for a total of 12 hours before coming to the not guilty verdict. The charges against Salman could have led to a life sentence for a guilty verdict.

29081,2018-03-31,No charges filed against officers involved in Alton Sterling’s death; one officer fired (Update),"One Baton Rouge police officer who was involved in the shooting death of Alton Sterling in 2016 will be fired, Police Chief Murphy Paul announced on Friday. Louisiana’s Attorney General had said Tuesday that no charges would be filed against two officers. The shooting, which occurred during an altercation with police outside a convenience store, was captured on video and shared via social media.
The officer who will be fired is Blane Salamoni. The other officer involved in the incident, Howie Lake II, will be suspended without pay for three days, Paul said.
Sterling’s death
In July 2016, Salamoni and Lake responded to a report of a man with a gun outside a Triple S Food Mart, after a homeless man had called the police about Sterling, according to AP. The homeless man said he had asked Sterling for money and Sterling showed him a gun. Sterling was selling homemade CD’s outside near the store.
The officers told Sterling, a 37-year-old African American, to put his hands on the hood of a car. According to Landry, Sterling did not comply. Lake used a taser on Sterling before forcing him to the ground. Federal and state authorities said Salamoni yelled that Sterling was reaching for a gun before shooting him three times. He then fired three more shots into Sterling’s back when he began to sit up and move. The officers allegedly found a loaded gun in Sterling’s pocket.
The altercation was captured on bystanders’ cellphones and then shared on social media. Officers’ body cameras and a store surveillance camera also recorded the encounter; those videos have not been publicly released. 
In July 2016, following the deaths of Sterling and others, demonstrations protesting police use of violence against African-Americans took place in Washington, New York and elsewhere.
Federal investigation
Federal authorities concluded after a 10-month review that there wasn’t enough evidence to prove the officers willfully deprived Sterling of his rights, or that their use of force was not “reasonable,” Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said on Tuesday.
L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer representing Sterling’s five children said investigators did not follow up with witnesses, and used information from two federal investigators who had already looked into the case.
Landry said his office reviewed the evidence compiled by the Justice Department and conducted its own interviews of witnesses. He concluded that drugs found in Sterling’s system may have contributed to his “non-compliance” with police officers’ requests. 
The two officers have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.

29633,2018-04-02,Caravan of Central American immigrants traveling through Mexico towards US border,"A caravan of more than a thousand immigrants from Central America were traveling as a group through Mexico towards the U.S. border over the weekend, Buzzfeed first reported on Friday. Many of them, primarily from Honduras, are planning to enter the U.S. illegally and either claim asylum or attempt to cross the border undetected. The caravan was organized by a volunteer group called “Pueblo Sin Fronteras,” Spanish for “People without Borders.” 

The group estimated 1,200 people in the caravan at the start of the journey in Tapachula, a city in the south of Mexico along the border with Guatemala. An estimated 80 percent of the immigrants are from Honduras, which has experienced increased violence following the election of President Juan Orlando Hernández. Others are from El Salvador and Guatemala, and possibly other countries. Some of them reportedly plan to settle in Mexico. 
Pueblo Sin Fronteras said the purpose of traveling in a group is to make it easier to bypass authorities and to reduce the chance of violence by members of drug cartels, or muggings. In 2010, 72 immigrants who were traveling the same route were killed by a drug cartel, Mother Jones reported.
Mexican authorities have not stopped the group to deport people who do not have travel visas, according to Buzzfeed. Mexico’s Constitution protects immigrants’ right to free transit, among other rights, according to the country’s National Commission for Human Rights.
The caravan was organized into groups of 10 to 15 people, each with a leader, that comprise security, food, and logistics committees. Pueblo Sin Fronteras said the immigrants are responsible for their own expenses for food, water and bus travel. 
The group has taken multiple forms of transport, including walking, taking buses, hitchhiking and riding on top of trains, Buzzfeed reported. They have been sleeping in town plazas, and are sometimes fed by local churches or townspeople.
US response
On Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted, “Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch  Release. Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming.”
“Catch and release” refers to the process under which U.S. authorities detain illegal immigrants and then release them while they are waiting for court hearings. U.S. National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) union chief Brandon Judd said immigrants could benefit from that program, and if they cross the border into the U.S., the border patrol must take them into custody and process them.
“Once [the immigrants] enter the country, even if [border patrol agents] are standing at the border with our hands out saying, ‘Don’t enter, don’t enter,’ all they have to do is cross one foot into the border and we have to take them into custody,” Judd said. “If they ask for asylum or say I fear to go back to my country, then we have to process them under ‘credible fear’ which allows them to be released into our country.”
Trump also tweeted, “Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!” He added that “these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA.”
DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, can be used to grant temporary work permits to people who were brought into the country illegally as children. DACA only applies to people who have resided continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007, and entered the U.S. without inspection before June 15, 2012.
The president also said in a tweet, “Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING” to stop the migration through its southern border and into the U.S., adding that Mexico “must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a press release from last Tuesday, addressed the issue of immigration discussed at a bilateral meeting. “Both sides expressed concerns with migration flows … The partners shared their mutual desire to confront transnational criminal organizations and money laundering. Lastly, both sides reiterated their long held respect for the human rights of migrants.”

29630,2018-04-02,"Teachers walk out, protest in Oklahoma and Kentucky","Teachers in Oklahoma walked out on Monday, seeking pay raises and additional school funding. Teachers in Kentucky protested Monday as well, opposing changes to their pension system. 
In Oklahoma, approximately 200 of the state’s 500 school districts shut down on Monday, according to the New York Times. The teachers are seeking pay increases, $10,000 for teachers and $5,000 for school support staff, as well as an additional $200 million in school funding, according to the state teachers union. 
Last week, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed into law legislation for teachers to receive a pay increase of approximately $6,100, support staff to receive a raise of $1,250, coupled with an additional $50 million in funding, CNN reported. The teachers said these increases were insufficient. It was the first pay increase for Oklahoma teachers in 10 years. Oklahoma City Public Schools have announced schools will be closed Tuesday, as well.
In Kentucky, a bill was passed in the state legislature last week that, if enacted, would phase out the current benefits package retirement plan for teachers, and implement a hybrid retirement plan for new teacher hires. 
Kentucky’s state pension plan is 56 percent funded, according to the Associated Press. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin has not signed the bill into law. Teachers rallied near the House and Senate chambers, opposing the bill’s final passage. There were 25 Kentucky school districts closed due to the walkout, according to CNN. 
A teachers’ strike in West Virginia ended last month with an agreement that the government would raise the pay of state employees, including teachers, by five percent and that teachers’ health plan premiums would stay the same for 16 months.

29610,2018-04-02,China introduces tariffs on $3B worth of US exports,"Chinese tariffs on 128 goods imported from the U.S. went into effect on Monday, totaling up to $3 billion dollars U.S., according to the Chinese government. China first announced the plan on March 23, in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from multiple countries, including China. 

China is adding a 15 percent tariff on 120 products, including fruits, nuts, wine ethanol and steel pipes, and a 25 percent tariff on eight products, including recycled aluminum and pork. China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement on Sunday night that announced the tariffs would go into effect on Monday.
The ministry said that the U.S. tariffs “seriously violate” the World Trade Organization (WTO) policies against non-discrimination in multilateral trade between members. The U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs do not apply to some countries, including Canada, Mexico and South Korea. 
China’s ministry said the U.S. declined to respond to China’s request through the WTO for consultation on the matter, which the ministry said alleviated the country from obligations to the U.S. “As a WTO member, China has the right not to meet some former obligations to the United States,” the ministry said. “China’s suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard China’s interests.”
On March 22, the U.S. also announced a plan to implement additional tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. The U.S. Office of the United States Trade Representative has sent that plan for public review during a period of at least 30 days before implementation. CNN cited Arthur Kroeber, a partner at economic research firm Gavekal, saying that China may respond to those planned tariffs by placing more on U.S. agricultural products. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. and China are in private discussions aimed at avoiding more increases to tariffs. China’s commerce ministry said it hoped the U.S. would remove its tariffs “as soon as possible so that the trading of products between China and the United States will return to a normal track.""
The U.S. had a trade deficit in goods to China of $375 billion last year, according to CNN. Chinese news outlet Xinhua reported that China had a trade deficit in services to the U.S. of $255 billion in 2017.

28962,2018-04-02,Egyptian President el-Sissi re-elected with 97% of the vote (Update),"President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi was re-elected with 97 percent of the vote in a three-day election that began last Monday and ended Wednesday. Voter turnout was 41 percent, Reuters reported.
One candidate ran against el-Sissi, Moussa Mustafa Moussa. Others had submitted their names as candidates earlier this year; all were later either arrested or withdrew their names, the Associated Press reported.
El-Sissi received 21.8 million votes, Moussa received 656,534, and there were 1.8 million spoiled ballots.
The election
Egypt’s military set up a media center to monitor local and foreign election coverage. The military said that police and military personnel had set up checkpoints and were running polling stations to maintain security. 

Last Wednesday, the Egyptian National Election Authority said it would enforce an election law and fine people who did not vote about $30. In previous elections, similar penalties had been announced, but not enforced, according to the Associated Press.

El-Sissi came to power in July 2013 after Egypt’s military overthrew former President Mohammed Morsi. Morsi had been the country’s first democratically elected president. His election followed the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, during which President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown. El-Sissi first ran for election in May 2014, and won almost 97 percent of the vote. Voter turnout was less than half of the country’s 60 million eligible voters.

29538,2018-04-02,Tesla: Autopilot engaged before fatal California Model X crash,"On Friday, Tesla, Inc. released a statement saying its Autopilot driver-assistance system was engaged before a fatal Model X accident in Mountain View, California on March 23. The driver, Wei Huang, died after the crash. Tesla said the system had produced multiple visual and one audible “hands-on” warning “earlier in the drive,” and that Huang’s hands were not on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision with a concrete roadside barrier. Tesla said it was “incredibly sorry” to the driver’s family and friends for their loss.
The company released a statement four days after the Model X crash, saying it had not yet recovered the sport utility vehicle’s logs. The company said its data showed Tesla drivers had driven the “same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged roughly 85,000 times since Autopilot was first rolled out in 2015 and roughly 20,000 times since just the beginning of the year, and there has never been an accident that we know of.” 
A week after the crash, Tesla released another statement, indicating it had recovered the vehicle’s logs. Tesla then said, “The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.”
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) were investigating the accident. After Tesla’s statement, NTSB spokesman Chris O’Neil said, “In each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data. However, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.” O’Neil added that NTSB’s “preliminary” report “generally occurs within a few weeks of completion of field work.”
The accident
The accident on Highway 101 occurred at 9:27 a.m. local time, according to Tesla. The Model X SUV caught fire after the accident. Tesla said, by witnesses’ accounts, “we understand there were no occupants still in the Model X by the time the fire could have presented a risk.” 
The highway crash attenuator the SUV hit had been damaged in a previous accident. An accident had occurred there 11 days prior, according to the CHP. ABC7 News did not say if the CHP indicated that accident caused the damage to the attenuator, which was apparent in photos posted by Tesla.
Huang, 38, was an Apple engineer. His family said he had previously talked to his Tesla dealer about an issue while driving in Autopilot whereby his car steered towards the same barrier “7/10” times that he would drive on that road, according to ABC7 News. Huang’s brother, Will, said the dealer was unable to duplicate the issue.
Tesla’s Autopilot system
Tesla’s Autopilot is described as an “advanced driver assistance system” that uses a series of cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar along with software to drive the vehicle semi-autonomously under certain conditions. In the Tesla Model S owner’s manual, some of the conditions under which the autopilot system may be unable to function as intended include poor visibility, bright lights, narrow or winding roads, and mud, snow or ice on the sensors. The manual includes this warning: “It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times.” 
A survey of 625 German Tesla owners published in November 2016 found that 98 percent of respondents said they were “familiar with the car warnings that Tesla provides about how Autopilot is to be properly used.” Seven percent said “the name ‘Autopilot’ caused [them] to believe that the car is fully autonomous, meaning that it does not require the driver to be supervising the car.”
Tesla said a review by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published in January 2017 found that Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent. The NHTSA’s study included crash rates before and after Autopilot had been installed, which were determined using air bag and mileage data from Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles. The crash rates after Autopilot was installed included driving both with and without the driver assistance system activated. Tesla said Autopilot has “improved further” since the study and that “perfectly prevent[ing] all accidents” is a standard that would be “impossible.”
Other fatalities involving self-driving vehicles
In 2016, a Tesla Model S crashed into a truck while in Autopilot mode. In that accident, Tesla said “neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.” The NHTSA report concluded the driver should have been able to see the tractor trailer for at least seven seconds prior to the crash. After the accident, Tesla changed its Autopilot software so the system would shut off for the remainder of the trip if a driver “fails to respond to the [system’s] alerts adequately,” according to the NHTSA.ing to the NHTSA.
On March 18 in Arizona, an Uber self-driving vehicle hit and killed a pedestrian walking her bicycle across the street away from a crosswalk at night. Video of the incident shows neither the person sitting in the driver’s seat nor the self-driving system appeared to brake before the impact. Uber has not said what caused the accident.
Crash statistics
Tesla said, on average, there is a fatality once every 86 million miles in the U.S. across all vehicles from all manufacturers. Tesla said for its vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware, the number is one in every 320 million miles. It concluded, “if you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident.” It did not provide total number of fatalities or miles driven. About a year ago, Tesla said it had four billion miles of driving data from its cars, not all with autopilot installed, according to Electrek.
In 2016, 37,461 people died on U.S. roads, including pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists, as well as automobile drivers and passengers, according to the NHTSA. The administration said 3.2 trillion miles had been driven in the U.S. in 2016. 
Tesla was founded in 2003. It released its first electric Roadster in 2008.

29728,2018-04-03,Van der Zwaan sentenced for making false statements to Mueller investigation,"Alex van der Zwaan, a U.K.-based Dutch attorney who pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents in February, was sentenced on Tuesday to 30 days in prison followed by two months of probation, and to pay a $20,000 fine. The case was a result of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and “related matters.” Van der Zwaan’s conviction does not involve the presidential campaign.
Before his sentencing, van der Zwaan told the judge, ""What I did was wrong. I apologize to the court, my wife and my family.”
In 2012, Van der Zwaan had done work and written a report for the Ukrainian government. He spoke to former Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates about the report without the approval of his then bosses at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Meagher  Flom law firm would not find out he had misled his bosses there about the Ukraine report. His attorneys said that after he made his initial false statements last year to investigators, he spoke to them two weeks later to correct his statements.

29722,2018-04-03,"Afghan military bombs religious school, kills at least 70","On Monday, Afghan military aircraft bombed a religious school in Dashti Archi in the Kunduz province of northern Afghanistan. At least 70 people were killed, according to Al Jazeera. Reports of fatalities differed among sources. Afghan Ministry of Defense spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said the military killed “more than 30 Taliban fighters, including nine commanders,” and “the Taliban training center was bombed and no civilians were present.” The Taliban said none of its fighters were present. Local police said there were some civilian casualties. 
Abdul Hameed Hameedi, a local police official, said Taliban fighters were meeting at the school and that 15 were killed and 10 wounded. According to the Taliban, about 150 civilians were killed, the majority of them children.
A witness told Al Jazeera that students were receiving awards at the time for completion of religious courses. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said it would investigate the incident.
U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesperson, Army Col. Lisa Garcia, said the U.S. did not “conduct air strikes” in Kunduz province on Monday. 
According to the U.N., there were 631 civilian deaths in 2017 from air attacks by government and international military forces, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2016.
The U.S. led an invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 that removed the Taliban from power. The Taliban is still present in parts of the country. In February, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani called for peace talks with the Taliban.

29655,2018-04-03,"Trump tweets about media bias, following online video of Sinclair anchors repeating scripted content","On Monday, President Donald Trump posted on Twitter about bias in the media, saying Sinclair Broadcast Group was “superior” to CNN and NBC News. Sinclair is a television broadcasting company that owns or operates 193 U.S. television stations and 614 channels. On Saturday, website Deadspin released a 98-second video that showed clips with news anchors from various Sinclair stations reading the same scripted lines about “fake news” and “personal bias” in the media. 
Some lines in the scripted Sinclair broadcasts include:
“The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first.”
“Some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal agenda.”
“This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.”
The local anchors also voiced a commitment to “fair, balanced and factual” reporting and called on viewers to report on the station’s website if viewers “believe our coverage is unfair.” 
A memo from Sinclair’s senior vice president of news directed the stations to read the script, according to CNNMoney. Most content on Sinclair stations is determined at a local level, while Sinclair requires local stations to air so-called “must-run” pieces up to nine times a week, PBS News reported.
Timothy Burke, the video editor who created the Deadspin video, said he requested and received more than 50 examples of the statement read on air. The video clips are from broadcasts aired during the month of March, according to NBC News. 
Sinclair response
Scott Livingston, Sinclair’s senior vice president of news, said on Monday that the goal of the announcement was to “reiterate our commitment to reporting facts in a pursuit of truth.” He said the company found it “curious” that it was being “attacked for asking our news people to remind their audiences that unsubstantiated stories exist on social media.” 
Livingston wrote in a memo to employees, obtained by NBC News, that “the stories we are referencing in this campaign are the unsubstantiated ones (i.e. fake/false) like ‘Pope Endorses Trump’ which move quickly across social media and result in an ill-informed public. Some other false stories, like the false 'Pizzagate' story, can result in dangerous consequences.”
Trump’s response
The Deadspin video and its contents were reported or referenced on CNN, MSNBC on Monday.
Trump’s Monday tweet on the matter read, “So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.”
Proposed merger
Sinclair stations are in 89 U.S. markets and reach millions of viewers. The group has plans to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. If the deal is approved, Sinclair would own at least 220 stations, and reach more than 70 percent of U.S. households. Sinclair said if the deal is approved it would sell but continue to operate stations in Chicago and New York.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would need to approve the merger proposal, determining if it adhered to antitrust laws. 
Sinclair proposed the merger after the FCC voted 3 to 2 in April of last year to reintroduce a policy on how broadcasters’ total percentage of the national market is calculated, making it easier for companies to expand. The FCC announced it would “reinstate the so-called ‘UHF discount’” that existed prior to August 2016 and permitted broadcasters “to count 50 percent of the television households in their market when determining compliance with the 39 percent national cap.”
On March 22 of this year, 38 Democratic lawmakers signed a letter requesting that an assistant attorney general reject the Sinclair-Tribune merger, arguing it would result in “negative competitive consequences” and “less local content.”

29649,2018-04-03,"Boko Haram attack in northeastern Nigeria kills 20, injures 82","Nigeria’s State Emergency Management Agency said on Monday that Boko Haram fighters attacked villages outside the city of Maiduguri in the country’s northeastern Borno state, killing 20 and injuring 82. The attack took place Sunday night. Army soldiers shot six armed attackers and seven suicide bombers, preventing them from entering Maiduguri, according to army spokesman Colonel Onyema Nwachukwu. 
Recent Boko Haram events
On March 21, Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed said 104 school girls were reportedly returned to the town of Dapchi, after 110 had been abducted by Boko Haram on Feb. 19. The minister also said the government was engaged in “cessation-of-hostility talks” with the militants.
Also in March, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said Boko Haram members who “lay down” their arms could be pardoned.  
Last Friday, four female suicide bombers between the ages of 13 to 18 killed two people in attacks on another settlement outside Maiduguri, according to AFP. 
Boko Haram, which loosely translates to “Western education is sin,” formed in the 1990s and seeks to institute its version of Sharia Islamic law. Boko Haram has fought government soldiers, raided villages, attacked churches and mosques, and performed kidnappings, assassinations, and suicide bombings, according to CNN. The group carried out its first violent attacks in 2003, CNN reported. Boko Haram is affiliated with the Islamic State group.

29874,2018-04-04,US proposes $50B in tariffs on Chinese imports; China responds with plans for tariffs,"On Tuesday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) proposed a 25 percent tariff on a list of about 1,300 categories of goods imported from China, totaling about $50 billion per year. The list includes some electronics, batteries, phones, furniture, aircraft parts and machinery. The USTR set a 30-day period to receive comments from businesses on the proposed tariffs. 

On Wednesday, China responded by saying it would impose tariffs totaling $50 billion on U.S. imports in response to new U.S. tariffs. China proposed tariffs on imports of 106 products from the U.S., including soybeans, cars and airplanes. 
On Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said, “Such unilateralistic and protectionist action has gravely violated fundamental principles and values of the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization].” It added, “It serves neither China’s interest, nor U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy.” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s office said the U.S. proposed tariffs were in “response to China’s unfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of U.S. technology and intellectual property.”
On March 22, Trump instructed the USTR to propose tariffs on China totaling about $60 billion. The USTR said “the total value of imports subject to the tariff increase is commensurate with an economic analysis of the harm caused by China’s unreasonable technology transfer policies to the U.S. economy.” According to a USTR report, the Chinese government “uses its administrative licensing and approvals processes to force technology transfer in exchange for the numerous administrative approvals needed to establish and operate a business in China.”
The USTR used algorithms to make its list of proposed tariffs, considering whether the technology used to make products may have been acquired from the U.S. by Chinese companies as a result of Chinese government policies, such as its “Made in China 2025” program. The USTR also considered how much of a negative effect the tariff might have on the U.S. economy, The Washington Post reported. Lighthizer said his office chose the items on the list to achieve the “lowest consumer impact”; toys and clothing were excluded. Some machinery used to make clothing and shoes may be impacted by the proposed tariffs, according to Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. “Made in China 2025” has a goal for China of “raising domestic content of core components and materials to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025,” according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday that “we are not in a trade war with China,” and “we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year” with China, “with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!” In a separate tweet he said, “When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can’t lose!”
In 2016, the U.S. had a trade deficit in goods with China of $347 billion, a 5.5 percent increase ($20.2 billion) over 2015, according to the USTR. The deficit in goods and services was $309 billion. In 2016, the U.S. exported $115.6 billion of goods to China, and exports to China accounted for 8 percent of all U.S. exports in 2016. U.S. exports of soybeans totaled $12.4 billion last year, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.
On March 1, Trump announced a separate plan to place tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel imports, and later the U.S. exempted some countries from one or both of these. China was not one of those countries. China responded by imposing tariffs of about $3 billion on imports of 128 categories of American products. Those tariffs went into effect on Monday.

29833,2018-04-04,A history of US media ownership regulations,"U.S. media ownership history involves various issues, including antitrust laws. Here's a brief overview:
According to Pew Research, the five largest companies in local TV are Sinclair, Nexstar, Gray, Tegna and Tribune. In 2004, those companies owned, operated or serviced 179 stations. That number increased to 378 in 2014 and 443 in 2016, which equals about 37 percent of all “full-power” local TV stations in the country.
Sinclair has plans to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would need to approve the merger proposal. Last month, a group of federal lawmakers signed a letter criticizing the merger.
According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), marketplace competition gives consumers “the benefits of lower prices, higher quality products and services, more choices, and greater innovation.” When one company owns a majority of a market, consumers may not have the ability to choose services based on quality or price, which the FTC claims can negatively affect the economy.
Since the turn of the 20th century, people have been debating who should have access to what forms of communication. For instance, some of the first efforts to regulate the airwaves occurred after the Titanic sank in 1912. An investigation found that radio interference contributed to delays in rescue operations. In response, Congress passed the Radio Act of 1912, which required all radio operators to be federally licensed. That Act also differentiated between airwaves for public use and those for commercial use. As communications expanded, the U.S. established additional regulations regarding access and ownership. Here are some of the more notable efforts to regulate communications.
1934: On June 19, the Communications Act establishes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to, among other things, regulate communications “by wire and radio,” and make those communications available to all U.S. residents at a “reasonable” cost “without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.”
1941: The FCC issues regulations on “chain broadcasting.” The FCC rules that it will not allow a radio network such as NBC to license more than one broadcast station in a single service area (i.e., the listening or viewing range of a broadcast station). It also prohibits networks from licensing one station in communities that have a limited number of broadcast stations or competition.
1946: The FCC starts prohibiting national TV broadcast networks from owning another national TV broadcast network.
1948: On Sept. 30, the FCC announces a “freeze” on granting new television broadcast licenses after being “inundated” with license applications. The “freeze,” which lasted for four years, helped the FCC establish standards for color TV, reserve channels for education and non-commercial purposes, and create a national channel allocation scheme.
1949: The FCC establishes the “Fairness Doctrine,” which requires every licensee to give a “reasonable portion” of broadcast time to the discussion of “controversial issues of public importance,” and make facilities available for the “expression of contrasting viewpoints held by responsible elements with respect to the controversial issues presented.”
1952: The FCC expands the available number of TV channels by allowing grants for UHF (ultra-high frequency) channels 14 through 69. Previously only VHF (very-high frequency) were available: channels 1 through 13.
1953: The FCC establishes the 7-7-7 rule: one party cannot own more than seven AM, seven FM, and seven TV stations nationwide. At least two of the TV stations had to be UHF. The rule also says one owner cannot have stations in each “medium” reaching more than 25 percent of the national audience.
1964: The TV Duopoly Rule is enacted, prohibiting any “entity” from owning two or more TV stations in the same market.
1970: The radio/TV cross-ownership rule prohibits a broadcaster from owning a radio station and a television station in the same market.
1975: The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits the ownership of both a newspaper and a television station in the same market.
1985: The FCC expands the “7-7-7 rule” to 12 AM, 12 FM and 12 TV stations nationwide. The FCC allows for a discount for the licensing of UHF stations to encourage their use and offset the issues that come with UHF stations: weaker signals and higher operational costs than VHF stations.
1987: The FCC abolishes the “fairness doctrine,” after finding it may have violated broadcasters’ free speech rights.
1992: The “12-12-12 rule” expands to 18 AM, 18 FM and 12 TV stations. The FCC also enacts the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, which increases the national audience range available for a station owner from 25 to 30 percent. An owner cannot have stations in each “medium” reaching more than 30 percent of the national audience.
1994: Ownership rules expand again. One party can own 20 AM, 20 FM and 12 TV stations.
1996: President Clinton signs the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which eliminates the “12 TV station” rule, increasing the number of television stations one entity could control to 35 percent of national cable ownership. It also eliminates the national cap on radio ownership.
1999: On Aug. 5, the FCC announces changes to the TV Duopoly rule. The changes allow for “duopolies” if the broadcaster: buys a poor-performing station that has no other buyers, the purchase results in the construction of a previously unbuilt station, or if only one of the two stations is among the top four-ranked stations in the market and there are at least eight “full-power independent stations” within the market after the merger.
2003: The FCC revises several rules regarding media ownership. For example, the revisions eliminate restrictions against cross-ownership in markets with more than nine television stations. And cross-ownership among television, radio and newspapers is not permitted in markets with three or fewer television stations. However, a court ruling halts the changes from being implemented. Later that year, Senate Republicans and the White House increase the TV station ownership cap to 39 percent of the national audience.
2009: Congress sets a June deadline for “full-power” television stations to stop broadcasting analog signals and convert to digital.
2016: The FCC announces the rescinding of the UHF discount, citing changes in technology. The FCC says that now that all stations are digital, UHF channels are no longer inferior to VHF channels.
2017: The FCC eliminates the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule; the radio/television cross-ownership rule; and the requirement that at least eight “full-power independent stations” remain in the market after the merger of two television stations in a market. The FCC also reinstates the UHF discount until the Commission can “address its national television ownership rule more holistically.”",Context|Politics|Trump,USA,,CNN|FCC|MSNBC|Sinclair Broadcasting Group,,media|news,world_news,publish
29760,2018-04-04,Trump tells EPA head Pruitt ‘we have your back’,"President Donald Trump told Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt on Monday by phone to “keep fighting” and said “we have your back,” according to White House officials. Trump’s call followed media reports on some of Pruitt’s actions since he took office, including: spending on first-class air travel, renting a condominium from an energy lobbyist, raising the salaries of two of his employees by more than 33 percent after being denied White House approval, and having an employee help with his housing search. An EPA spokesman said Pruitt’s actions have been in compliance with federal ethics regulations.
The EPA’s inspector general is investigating Pruitt’s 2017 travel expenses. Politico reported that the government spent more than $105,000 on first-class travel for Pruitt in his first year as EPA administrator. EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said “EPA’s Protective Service Detail identified specific ongoing threats associated with Administrator Pruitt’s travel and shifted his [air travel] class based on certain security protocols that require him to be near the front of the plane.”
Pruitt rented a condominium in Washington from Vicki Hart, the wife of energy lobbyist Steven Hart, for $50 per night, paying a total of $6,100 for stays over a six month period, according to the Washington Post. CNN reported this amount was below market value. Steven Hart’s firm has lobbied the EPA on behalf of an Oklahoma company. The Harts hosted a fundraiser for Pruitt’s successful run for Oklahoma attorney general in 2014 and have contributed to his campaign, CNN reported. 
According to Wilcox, EPA career ethics officials said Pruitt’s “housing arrangement for both himself and family was not a gift and the lease was consistent with federal ethics regulations.”
The Washington Post reported that Pruitt effectively raised the salaries of two of his employees after the White House declined requests to increase their salaries. An anonymous source cited by The Washington Post said Pruitt re-appointed the two employees using an authority he has under the Safe Drinking Water Act to hire and set the salaries of up to 30 people without presidential or congressional approval. With the re-appointment, Pruitt increased one employee’s salary by 52 percent from $107,435 to $164,200 and another’s by 33 percent from $86,460 to $114,590, The Atlantic reported. The employees previously worked for Pruitt while he was in Oklahoma, according to The Washington Post.
Pruitt later said he did not give the raises, rather his staff did, and that it “should not have happened.” He said he found out about the pay raises on Tuesday, and had “changed it,” without specifying what that meant. He added that “there will be some accountability on that.”
The Washington Post reported that one of these employees helped Pruitt search for housing last year, a personal task. Don Fox, a former acting director and general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, said having an assistant work on a personal task would be a violation of federal rules. “There’s a general prohibition against misusing government resources, and employees are government resources,” Fox said.  
Wilcox said “the notion that government resources were used to assist in finding housing is categorically false.”
Recent EPA policy change announcements under Pruitt
On Tuesday, the EPA released a statement saying that Pruitt’s Midterm Evaluation process determined that previous greenhouse gas emission standards for model year (MY) 2022-2025 cars and light trucks should be revised. Pruitt announced the start of a “joint process” with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop a notice to set “more appropriate” greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards.
Pruitt said: “the Obama Administration’s determination was wrong. Obama’s EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn’t comport with reality, and set the standards too high.” 
The MY2025 standards the EPA set in January 2017, which Pruitt said “should be revised,” had essentially set vehicle emission requirements to average 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by 2025. That determination would be based on further projections and manufacturing, the EPA report said at the time. 
A Clean Air Act waiver allows California to impose its own standards for vehicle emissions limits, and to make them higher than federal standards. The EPA said in its statement that it is reexamining that waiver.
In October of last year, Pruitt signed a proposal to withdraw from the Clean Power Plan of 2015, which regulated carbon emissions. Trump called last March for a review of the plan.

29734,2018-04-04,Trump says military to guard US-Mexican border until we have ‘a wall and proper security’,"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that until the U.S. has a ""wall and proper security"" along the border with Mexico, it would guard the border ""with the military."" Trump called it a ""big step,"" adding, ""we really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before.""
""I’ve been speaking with [Defense Secretary] General [James] Mattis — we’re going to be doing things militarily.  Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,"" Trump said. 
The U.S. deployed National Guard troops to the border between 2006 and 2008, and in 2010. 
Trump made the comments while meeting at the White House with leaders of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
During a two-year period starting in 2006, President George W. Bush’s administration deployed 6,000 National Guard members to California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to repair fences, construct barriers and fly border agents in helicopters to catch immigrants attempting to illegally enter the U.S., according to CNN. In 2010, under President Barack Obama, the National Guard aided U.S.-Mexico border agents with surveillance and intelligence until U.S. Customs and Border Protection could hire more staff, CNN reported.
At the same meeting with Baltic leaders, Trump mentioned a “caravan” of immigrants from Central America who are now traveling through Mexico towards the U.S. Some members of the caravan intend to either request asylum in the U.S. or enter the country undetected, Buzzfeed reported. Trump said, ""If [the caravan] reaches our border, our laws are so weak … it’s like we have no border."" He also said he told Mexico “very strongly” that it was going to ""have to do something about these caravans.""
Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders), a group organizing the immigrants, said Mexican authorities had agreed to provide humanitarian visas to allow some of the immigrants to remain in Mexico.

29957,2018-04-05,Brazilian court rules former president Lula to be jailed during second corruption appeal,"Brazil’s highest court ruled on Thursday that former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would not be allowed to remain free while he appeals his 12-year sentence for corruption. The Supreme Federal Tribunal ruled 6-5 based on a 2016 lower court ruling that defendants could be jailed after one failed appeal, BBC reported. Lula’s sentence was increased from 9 1/2 years to 12 years during a first failed appeal in January. Lula has denied wrongdoing.
After the ruling, Brazilian federal judge Sergio Moro ordered Lula to turn himself in by 5 p.m. local time Friday, Moro’s press office said. He can still appeal the case on procedural grounds.
Lula said the corruption case was politically motivated. He has previously announced his intention to run in the upcoming October presidential elections, though he has not officially registered as a candidate. A 2010 Brazilian law prohibits those convicted of crimes that aren’t overturned through an appeal from running for office for a minimum of eight years, according to BBC. Exceptions have been made to the law in the past, according to BBC. The Superior Electoral Court could decide to make such an exception if Lula registers as a presidential candidate before the Aug. 15 deadline.
Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering in July of last year. The charges were for receiving an apartment and favors worth $1.1 million from a construction company that allegedly received contracts from state-run oil company Petrobras in return. Lula's lawyers said it was never proven that he was the owner of the apartment. They also said some of the testimony against Lula came from the former chairman of the construction company, who has been convicted of corruption. 
The case is related to “Operation Car Wash,” initiated in 2014 to investigate allegations that Petrobras awarded contracts based on bribes.
There have been protests in Brazil, both for and against Lula. After the ruling, Lula’s Workers’ Party said it was a “tragic day for democracy in Brazil.”
Lula, 72, was president of Brazil from 2003 to 2011.

29897,2018-04-05,"White House: IS in Syria ‘almost completely destroyed’; US, partners ‘remain committed’ to eliminating it","In a statement Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the military mission to “eradicate” the Islamic State (IS) in Syria “is coming to a rapid end,” with the group “almost completely destroyed.” She said the U.S. and its partners “remain committed” to eliminating the “small” IS presence in Syria “that our forces have not already eradicated.” She added that the U.S. “expect[s]” some countries and the U.N. to “work toward peace and ensure” that IS “never re-emerges.”
In her statement, Sanders also said, “We will continue to consult with our allies and friends regarding future plans.”
Trump has not approved a specific timetable for withdrawal, according to an official cited by Reuters.
Last Thursday in a speech on infrastructure in Ohio, President Donald Trump said, “We’re knocking the hell out of ISIS,” and, “We’ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now.”
On Saturday, Trump directed the State Department to stop $200 million of recovery aid for Syria while the U.S. reconsidered its policy in the country.
On Tuesday, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of the U.S. Central Command overseeing American operations in Syria, said, “A lot of very good military progress was made over the last couple years.” He added, “the hard part I think is in front of us, and that is stabilizing these areas, consolidating our gains, getting people back into their homes, addressing the long-term issues of reconstruction.” He said, “there is a military role in this, certainly in the stabilization phase.”
An American-led coalition has been combatting IS in Syria since 2014. About 2,000 U.S. troops remain stationed there. U.S. troops work with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias. U.S. air strikes have helped SDF gain control of tens of thousands of square kilometers from IS over the past three years, according to BBC.
Officials in the global coalition fighting IS said the group has lost 98 percent of the land it once controlled in Syria and Iraq, BBC reported. Votel said that more than 90 percent of territory that was IS-controlled in 2014 has been taken back by the U.S.-led coalition. IS currently controls some territory in eastern Syria, in the Euphrates River Valley, according to BBC. Some Kurdish fighters who had been combatting IS there are now fighting Turkish troops in the northwestern Afrin region of Syria.

29894,2018-04-05,"Facebook announces data policy changes, says 87 million users’ data ‘improperly shared’ with Cambridge Analytica","Facebook said in a blog post Wednesday it believed the data of up to 87 million users, about 82 percent of them from the U.S., had been “improperly shared” with Cambridge Analytica. It also said “malicious actors” have “abused” a Facebook search feature that uses email addresses or phone numbers to find people on the site. The company said it believed “most” people on Facebook “could have had their public profile scraped in this way,” adding that it had disabled the feature.
Cambridge Analytica is a company that collected data to develop campaign ads and strategies in an attempt to help candidates such as President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) get elected. The New York Times and The Observer reported last month that the firm had obtained data on more than 50 million Facebook users in a way that violated Facebook’s policies.
In its announcement of the “nine most important changes” it was making to “better protect” user information, Facebook also mentioned changes to data policies for Events, Groups and Pages, and said it “expect[s] to make more changes over the coming months.”
Facebook said starting on April 9 it will place a link at the top of users’ News Feeds showing what apps they use and what information they have shared with those apps. It will also inform users if their information may have been “improperly shared” with Cambridge Analytica. 
Facebook’s announcement also addressed a feature of its Messenger app on Android devices that puts frequently contacted people at the top of a user’s contact list. The feature relies on users opting in on providing the app with their devices call and text histories. The company said it “reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages,” and that it would delete all data logs older than one year. It said it would still provide this feature on Messenger while stopping the upload of “broader data” such as call times.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify to the House Energy and Commerce Committee next week on the company’s data privacy practices.

29891,2018-04-05,Chemical weapons group rejects Russian request for joint investigation of Skripals poisoning,"On Wednesday, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) voted to reject Russia’s request for a joint investigation with the U.K. into the March 4 poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England. The vote was 15-6, with 17 abstentions and three absences or countries ineligible to vote. Countries that voted to grant the request included Algeria, Azerbaijan, China, Iran and Sudan, Reuters reported.
On Tuesday, the U.K.’s Porton Down laboratory, which identified the poison as “military grade” Novichok, said it could not verify the source of the nerve agent. The Soviet Union developed Novichok and other nerve agents in the 1970s and 1980s. Porton Down said the substance likely came from a “state actor.” 
John Foggo, acting British envoy to the OPCW, said the U.K. concluded Russia was responsible for the attack based on: the nerve agent used, Russia’s capability of producing it, its record of assassinating defectors, and that it had given 24 “contradictory and changing counter-narratives” about the poisoning. Foggo added that Russia suggesting the attack may have been sponsored by the U.S., the U.K. or Sweden was “preposterous.”
OPCW Russian representative Aleksander Shulgin said his country had nothing to do with the poisoning and that it had the appearance of a “terrorist attack.” He had earlier said Russia would reject the results of the OPCW investigation if it was not allowed to participate in the testing of Salisbury samples. The OPCW, which oversees the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, expects results from those tests next week.
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia has called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday to discuss Britain’s accusations against Russia.
Sergei Skripal remains in critical condition in a U.K. hospital. His daughter, a Russian citizen, has shown improvement and is no longer in critical condition. The two were found unconscious on a park bench after the attack. 
After British Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was “highly likely” responsible for the attack, more than 20 countries expelled a total of 150 Russian diplomats. Russia responded in kind, saying it would expel a total of 150 diplomats from those countries.

30088,2018-04-06,Former South Korean President Park sentenced to 24 years in prison,"A South Korean court sentenced former President Park Geun-hye to 24 years in prison on Friday after being found guilty of charges related to corruption. The Seoul Central District Court also fined Park 18 billion won ($16.9 million). Park has denied wrongdoing and said she would appeal her sentence. 
Park was found guilty of 16 of the 18 charges brought against her, mostly related to abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Prosecutors alleged that Park conspired with her friend Choi Soon-sil to influence companies, including Samsung and retail company Lotte Group, to donate to foundations controlled by Choi. Park was accused last year of receiving 59.2 billion won ($52.1 million) in bribes from several companies. Park was also convicted of leaking 47 confidential presidential documents to Choi, who had no political credentials. Park has known Choi since the 1970s.
Kim Se-yoon, the sentencing judge, said during the hearing, “the defendant abused her presidential power entrusted by the people, and as a result, brought massive chaos to the order of state affairs and led to the impeachment of the president, which was unprecedented.” Kim said Park had not shown any “sign of repentance,” and had attempted to say Choi and her secretaries were responsible. “We cannot help but sternly hold her accountable,” the judge said.
Prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Park to 30 years and fine her 118.5 billion won ($112 million).
The sentencing was broadcast live in South Korea; the court cited public interest in the case for the decision to televise the hearing. Park was not in attendance at the Friday hearing. She has boycotted her trial hearings, BBC reported, alleging the court is biased against her.
As many as a thousand people gathered outside the courthouse to support Park, Reuters reported, including some who held signs that called her conviction “political revenge.”
Background
Park, 66, is the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, who was killed in office in 1979. She reentered politics in the 1990s and later ran for the presidency. She took office in 2013 as the country’s first female leader.
In 2016, protests called for her removal from office as she was being investigated for corruption. In December of that year, South Korea’s National Assembly voted to impeach her. Then on March 10, 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld that decision. The ruling meant Park had to leave office and lost her immunity from prosecution. Park is the first democratically elected South Korean president to be impeached.
Park was arrested on March 31, 2017, and has been in jail since then. 
South Korea elected Moon Jae-in as its new president in May of last year.
Related cases 
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors‘ Office said in April of last year that it had investigated 110 people regarding the alleged bribery involving Choi and Park.
Choi, Park’s friend, was convicted in a separate trial and sentenced in February to 20 years in prison.
Shin Dong-bin, the chairman of the Lotte Group, the country’s fifth largest retailer, was sentenced to two years and six months. 
Lee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y. Lee, a leader and heir to the Samsung Group, was originally sentenced to five years in jail last August. In February, some of his convictions were overturned and the sentence was reduced to two-and-a-half years. The court suspended his sentence for four years, and he was released from jail in the interim.

29993,2018-04-06,Russia calls Facebook’s removal of 273 pages and accounts associated with indicted Russian company ‘censorship’,"On Thursday, Russia called Facebook’s announcement that it had removed a total of 273 pages and accounts associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) “censorship.” Russian state-owned news outlet TASS cited Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying Facebook’s decision is a form of censorship towards Russian media. 
In February, U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted the IRA, two other companies and 13 Russian nationals for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia asked for an explanation of Facebook’s decision from the U.S. State Department. 
On Tuesday, Facebook said it had removed 70 Facebook accounts, 138 Facebook pages and 65 Instagram accounts that it said were “controlled” by the IRA. Facebook owns Instagram. Facebook stated 95 percent of the pages it removed had content in Russian and that “many” of the pages ran ads, “all of which have been removed.” 
Facebook said it removed the pages based on their association with the IRA, not based on their content. The company said, “the IRA has consistently used inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate people.” Facebook added that it did not want the IRA on its site, and that it would remove every account it finds with links to the IRA.
The statement from Facebook said about 1.1 million unique users followed at least one of the Facebook pages it removed; about 488,000 of them were from Russia and 170,000 from Ukraine. The pages also included followers from other countries, including at least 18,000 users from each of the following countries: Brazil, Georgia, Krygyzstan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kasakhstan, Uzbekistan and Moldova. 
Russian news outlet RT reported that pages of the Russian Federal News Agency and the Moscow mayor’s economic development office were among those removed.
Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, said: “It is clear that this is part of the anti-Russian campaign in which the media landscape is being cleansed of alternative sources of information, under the pretext of Russian interference in the 2016 election.” She referred to the account removal as “totalitarian methods of control and censorship.”

29987,2018-04-06,EPA: Samantha Dravis resigns as senior counsel,"Samantha Dravis, senior counsel and associate administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Office of Policy, resigned last week, the EPA confirmed on Thursday. Dravis, 34, worked with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt when he was Oklahoma attorney general and she was policy director and general counsel at the Republican Attorneys General Association. 
Dravis has also previously held positions as the president of the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a public policy organization associated with the Republicans Attorneys General Association, and as a legal counsel at Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a group “dedicated to protecting freedom and expanding opportunity” for Americans.
EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said, “After serving for over a year as EPA’s head of policy, Samantha Dravis has decided to pursue other opportunities.” She added that the “agency wishes her success in her future endeavors.”
Update on EPA coverage
Recent news articles have reported on Pruitt’s behavior in office, including incidents that some have alleged violated ethics regulations. One such incident involved Pruitt’s renting of a condominium from the wife of an energy lobbyist, reportedly at below market-value rates. On Wednesday, Kevin Minoli, an EPA ethics official, said he did not have all the facts when he ruled that Pruitt’s $50 per night condominium rental was in line with the department’s ethics policies. 
Minoli said he made his determination based on the lease that stated Pruitt would occupy one bedroom. Media reports said Pruitt’s daughter stayed in a second bedroom when she interned at the White House last summer, and Minoli said Pruitt’s average rent of $1,000 per month was less than one-third of the average listed rental cost of nearby two-bedroom homes.
On Thursday, President Donald Trump said of Pruitt, “I think he’s done a fantastic job.” When asked about potential ethics violations concerning Pruitt, Trump said, “he’s a good man, he’s done a terrific job. But I’ll look at it.”

29982,2018-04-06,Israeli forces have killed at least 19 Palestinians in Gaza protests,"Israeli soldiers have killed at least 19 Palestinians and injured more than 1,000 since protests began along the Gaza border last Friday. An Israeli aircraft killed a Palestinian protester near the Gaza Strip border fence on Thursday, according to Palestinian health officials. Another protester that Israeli soldiers shot last Friday also died on Thursday. 

Palestinians began demonstrations and sit-ins on the anniversary of “Land Day,” and they were scheduled to last a total of six weeks. Land Day is held in remembrance of an incident in which Israeli forces fatally shot six Palestinians on March 30, 1976, as the Palestinians were protesting Israeli land seizures. 
The protests, called “The March of Return,” are scheduled to end on May 15, known as “Nakba Day,” which recognizes the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Protesters are calling for Palestinians who left Israeli areas during and around the May 1948 war, and their descendants, to be granted the “right to return” to those areas. Israel said it will not allow the right of return. 
There are tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in five locations along the border between Israel and the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Initially, Palestinians stayed about 2,300 feet (700 meters) away from the border fence, Al Jazeera reported. 
Some of the protesters have rolled burning tires, thrown rocks and reportedly attempted to damage the border fence. Some have said they intend to use mirrors and lasers to distract Israeli snipers, according to The Jerusalem Post. Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Israel was “prepared for every scenario, even an attempt to cause sharpshooters to lose focus.” 
Israeli snipers have shot protesters that the Israeli military said had approached the border fence. Israel has also used rubber bullets and tear gas on Palestinian protesters.
The Jerusalem Post reported that Palestinian militant groups said some of those killed were their members. It didn’t specify which groups reportedly said this. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, and Israeli army spokesman, said Hamas was attempting to use the protests as a diversion to “open up the fence and then to insert terrorists into Israel.”
Israeli Minister of Defense Avigdor Lieberman said Israel did not “intend to change” its “rules of engagement” and that “if there are provocations, there will be a reaction of the harshest kind like last week.”
Hamas, the political group that governs Gaza, said on Thursday it would give $3,000 to the families of anyone killed in the protests and $500 or $200 to those wounded, depending on the severity of the injuries. Hamas official Mohammed Thuraya said, “This is our duty to our people, to ease the suffering of our citizens.” He said it wasn’t a “price tag” on casualties.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation into the deaths. On Saturday, the U.S. blocked a draft resolution by the U.N. Security Council that called for an investigation into the killing of 17 Palestinian protesters near the Gaza border during the current protests. Walter Miller, U.S. representative to the U.N., said “bad actors” were using the “protests as a cover to incite violence.”
Jason Greenblatt, the U.S. envoy to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, said in a statement, “We condemn leaders and protesters who call for violence or who send protesters - including children - to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed.”

30120,2018-04-07,DOJ announces ‘zero-tolerance’ policy on illegal immigration,"On Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed the state attorneys general offices along the southern border with Mexico to “immediately” adopt a new “zero-tolerance policy” for immigrants illegally entering the U.S. The policy affects offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), which the Department of Justice (DOJ) says prohibits both illegal entry and attempted illegal entry. 
When introducing the new “zero-tolerance policy,” the DOJ cited a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report that the number of known illegal border crossings increased 203 percent from March 2017 to March 2018. In March, there were 50,308 people apprehended at the border, an increase of 37 percent from the previous month. The figure does not account for any immigrants who may have entered the country undetected. 
While introducing the policy, Sessions said that “Congress has failed to pass effective legislation” that would close “dangerous loopholes” and “fully” fund a wall along the Mexican border. 
In a memorandum to prosecutors in border districts, Sessions said that if adopting the policy requires additional resources, the offices should request them. The memo also said the goal of the policy was “not simply more cases,” rather to “end the illegality in our immigration system.” 
Immigration courts are administered as a part of the executive branch of the government, under a delegated authority from the attorney general, rather than as part of the judicial branch. AP reported that as of Oct. 1 last year, immigration judges were each expected to process 700 cases per year. There are currently about 700,000 immigration cases pending, according to AP.
Border protection
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump said that he would send the “military” to guard the border with Mexico until the U.S. has a “wall and proper security.” The White House has since said that Trump is authorizing deployment of National Guard units to the border to aid U.S. Border Patrol agents.
“The National Guard, in coordination with governors, will remain in a support role until Congress takes the action necessary to close the loopholes undermining our border security efforts, including ending the practice of Catch and Release,” according to the White House. Catch and release refers to the process under which U.S. authorities can detain illegal immigrants and then release them in the U.S. while they are waiting for court hearings.
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a press briefing on Wednesday that plans were “being finalized,” and that it would take “time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and we are moving quickly.” Nielsen said the administration was giving the governors “the opportunity to review our suggestions of how the National Guard can support the Border Patrol,” and would provide numbers of deployments as soon as possible.
The secretary added that the U.S. allows “tens of millions of legal visitors every year, as well as over 1 million legal immigrants,” and would “continue to do so.”
The National Guard has been deployed to the border on previous occasions: about 1,200 troops under President Barack Obama, and about 6,000 under President George W. Bush.

30117,2018-04-07,Syrian airstrikes in eastern Ghouta reportedly kill 27 civilians,"Airstrikes carried out by Syrian government forces on the town of Douma killed 27 civilians on Friday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group. 
 
 Syrian state TV said the rebel group called “Jaish al-Islam” had shelled a residential area and a crossing in eastern Ghouta, and then the air force attacked. The rebel group denied targeting the residential area. The Observatory also said shell attacks on  the city of Damascus killed four people on Friday. State media said the rebels were responsible for the Damascus shelling. 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces began an offensive against rebel groups in eastern Ghouta, where Douma is located, in February. More than 1,600 civilians have been killed since then, according to the Observatory. 
Assad’s forces and Jaish al-Islam began negotiations ten days ago. The talks, overseen by Russia, ended without resolution, according to a commander in Assad’s regional military alliance who spoke to Reuters. The commander also said, “As far as Douma is concerned, resolving it militarily is the solution.” 
A commander in a regional alliance that fights for the Assad government said Jaish al-Islam had been offered safe transport out of Douma to rebel-held areas near Aleppo, in the northeast. The group wants to remain in Douma and none of the fighters have left, according to Mohammad Alloush, a representative for Jaish al-Islam.
Syrian state TV said Jaish al-Islam has abducted soldiers and civilians. There are tens of thousands of people estimated to be living in Douma, according to Reuters.

30091,2018-04-07,US Treasury sanctions Russian individuals and companies,"On Friday, the U.S. announced sanctions against Russian individuals and corporations, including seven Russian “oligarchs,” 17 Russian government officials, 12 companies owned or controlled by the “oligarchs,” and a state-owned weapons trading company and its subsidiary bank. The U.S. Treasury said the sanctions apply to individuals whom the department says “benefit” from Putin’s leadership and allegedly “play a key role in advancing Russia’s malign activities.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said these activities include Russia’s occupation of Crimea, providing weapons to President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in Syria, alleged malicious cyber activities and so-called “attempting to subvert Western democracies.”
The Treasury’s action freezes all assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits Americans from dealing with the sanctioned Russian individuals and corporations. Non-U.S. persons could be subject to sanctions as well if they facilitate transactions for the individuals or entities sanctioned.
Friday’s sanctions were issued under the authority of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), and three executive orders. In January of this year, the Treasury issued a report that named 210 Russians who were allegedly linked to the Russian government. The list was published as a requirement of the CAATSA legislation that Congress passed last year.
In March, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against five entities and 19 individuals for “malign Russian cyber activity.” 
The Russian embassy in the U.S. released a statement on Friday’s sanctions that said the U.S. “has made yet another erroneous step to destroy the freedom of enterprise and competition, to impair integration processes in the global economy,” calling the sanctions a “blow on the Russian-US relations.”

30463,2018-04-09,US ethics office says EPA needs to ‘take action’ on Pruitt allegations,"In a letter released Monday, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) needed to ""take action"" on potential ethics violations by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. David Apol, the acting director of the OGE, sent the letter dated April 6 to Kevin Minoli, the EPA's designated ethics official. The letter referenced recent news reports about Pruitt’s actions and said “public trust demands” that employees act “free from any actual or perceived conflicts.” Apol said the EPA needed to “take action to appropriately address any violations.” 
 
 Last week, an EPA spokesman said Pruitt’s actions were in compliance with federal ethics regulations.
In his letter, Apol said the OGE expects the EPA to “review and analyze” Pruitt’s: 

	rental agreement with the wife of an energy lobbyist for an apartment in Washington, D.C. 
	expenses for “travel, security, and salaries for some employees.”
	use of subordinates’ time and the possibility he “misused his position.”
	alleged decision to reassign or demote staff who were “attempting to ensure that the expenses and other actions were in accordance with laws and regulations.”

Last week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration was performing a “full review” of the allegations against Pruitt. On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted about Pruitt, saying, “Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!”
The EPA’s inspector general and the Government Accountability Office are investigating Pruitt’s actions. The OGE does not have authority to take action with respect to any possible violation, according to CNN.

30443,2018-04-09,Florida Gov. Rick Scott announces his candidacy for US Senate,"Florida Governor Rick Scott announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on Monday, speaking at an event in Orlando. He will be running against Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who is currently serving his third term. Scott, a 65-year-old Republican, has served two terms as Florida governor. 
Scott released a minute-and-a-half-long announcement video on Facebook and Twitter, in which he said he would “shake up Washington” and that it was time to “make Washington get to work.” Scott said he was “fixated on job creation,” saying that he “grew up poor.” He did not discuss specific policy plans in his video. 
Prior to entering politics, Scott served in the U.S. Navy, worked as a lawyer and later owned and was chief executive of a healthcare company.
President Donald Trump has said Scott should run for the Senate seat. At an event last September, Trump told reporters, “I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate.”
In response to Scott’s bid, Sen. Nelson said he’s always “run every race like there’s no tomorrow — regardless of [his] opponent,” and that he has “always believed that if you just do the right thing, the politics will take care of itself.” Nelson is the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee. He has served in the U.S. House of Representatives, as the Florida state treasurer, an insurance commissioner and fire marshal in Florida. He’s also a former NASA astronaut.
The Republican party currently holds a 51 to 49 majority in the U.S. Senate. Midterm elections are scheduled for Nov. 6, 2018.

30428,2018-04-09,"Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán wins third term, coalition supermajority","Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was re-elected to a third term in the country’s general election on Sunday. Orbán’s Fidesz party and its smaller coalition partner, the Christian Democrat party, won at last 134 of the 199 seats in the parliament, according to preliminary results with 99 percent of the vote counted. That is enough for a two-thirds supermajority.
Voter turnout was 69 percent, BBC reported. The Jobbik party, described as “nationalist” by AP and Reuters, won the second most seats at 25, according to preliminary results. Next was a coalition led by the Socialist party with 20 seats, followed by the Green Party in fourth place. Final election results are due by April 27. 
The prime minister did not hold any public debates with opponents or speak with independent media, BBC reported. He campaigned at rallies with supporters. 
Orbán’s party is described as “right-wing” and “nationalist” by media outlets. The prime minister ran on a platform to stop immigration, which he said would “slowly” overtake the country. In 2015, his government constructed a fence along the borders with Serbia and Croatia to deter illegal immigration. He also said he would reduce income taxes. 
Before the election, the government submitted a so-called “Stop Soros” group of bills to parliament, named after Hungarian-born U.S. investor George Soros, who donates to non-government organizations (NGOs) that support open immigration policies. The legislation would impose a 25 percent tax on foreign donations to selected Hungarian NGOs, and would require NGO work to be approved by the interior minister, who could deny permission on the basis of “national security.” A government spokesperson said the bills were designed to close “legal loopholes” used by NGOs that advocate for people seeking asylum. 
Orbán said last month that Soros was attempting to turn Hungary into “an immigrant country.” Soros has called Orbán’s comments “distortions and lies.” 
Orbán’s party won 85 of the 88 districts outside the capital city of Budapest, while left-wing parties won 12 of the 18 districts in the capital area, said Tamás Boros, co-director of the Belgian and Hungarian-based Policy Solutions think tank.
Orbán first served as prime minister from 1998 to 2002, followed by two terms of Socialist party rule. Orban was re-elected as Prime Minister in 2010. His Fidesz party won supermajorities in 2010 and 2014, then lost the two-thirds majority during by-elections in 2015.

30394,2018-04-09,Syrian media report missile strike on airbase in Homs,"A Syrian military airbase near the city of Homs was attacked by missiles early Monday morning, leading to an unspecified number of casualties, according to a report by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). The report said Syrian government forces shot down eight missiles at the T4 airbase, and that the attacks were “likely to be an American aggression."" The Pentagon later issued a statement saying, “At this time, the Department of Defense is not conducting airstrikes in Syria.”

In a separate incident on Saturday, 41 people were reported killed and hundreds wounded in an alleged poison gas attack in the town of Douma, according to the Syrian American Medical Society, a nonprofit medical relief organization. Media outlets such as the Associated Press and BBC said the report could not be independently confirmed. 
On Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted that the area of the alleged chemical attack was “in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army,” and that it was “completely inaccessible to outside world.” “Open [the] area immediately for medical help and verification,” he said.
Turkey said there was “strong suspicion” that the Syrian government forces were responsible for the alleged chemical attack, and the European Union issued a statement saying evidence suggested the alleged attack was “by the regime.” The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has denied the allegations and Russia’s Maj. Gen. Yuri Yevtushenko said the reports of a chemical attack were “fabricated.”
The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the alleged chemical attack. 
Since February, there has been fighting in Douma between the rebel group “Jaish al-Islam,” or Army of Islam, and Syrian government forces. On Sunday, Yevtushenko said the Russian military had negotiated an agreement between the Syrian government and the rebel group to evacuate 8,000 of the rebels and about 40,000 of their family members from Dhouma. Buses have entered the town to transport people to opposition-held territory in north Syria, according to SANA.

30386,2018-04-09,Canadian police release names of 15 people killed in hockey team bus crash (Update),"On Monday, Canadian authorities said that one of the 15 people who were killed in a collision between a tractor-trailer and a bus carrying a junior league hockey team had been misidentified. Ten junior hockey players, aged 16 to 21, and five members of the team’s personnel were killed in the Friday accident in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Fourteen of the 29 people on board were injured, and three were in critical condition as of Saturday. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had released the identities on Sunday night. The RCMP are investigating the cause of the crash.
The hockey team, the Humboldt Broncos, had been on route to a semifinals playoff game in the town of Nipawin when their bus collided with the tractor-trailer at around 5:00 pm local time on Friday. The bus was near Tisdale, traveling north on Highway 35, while the tractor-trailer was traveling westbound on Highway 335, according to the RCMP. 
The driver of the tractor-trailer was not injured and is not under criminal investigation, the RCMP said. 
""Our investigators will be looking at all aspects of this accident to determine what took place,"" RCMP Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said. ""It's too early to comment on the cause of the collision.""
The RCMP and the Office of the Chief Coroner released the full list of the deceased on Sunday. On Monday, Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Justice said that the body of Parker Tobin, had been misidentified as Xavier Labelle, who is alive. The ministry said he was misidentified in part because all of the players had dyed blond hair for the playoffs and similar builds. A ministry spokesperson said the Office of the Chief Coroner apologized for the mistake.
The deceased are as follows:
Players
Adam Herold, 16
Conner Lukan, 21

30380,2018-04-09,Creator of #MeToo tweets about Tony Robbins’ comments on the movement,"On Saturday, Tarana Burke, creator of the “MeToo” movement, tweeted about comments made by Tony Robbins, self-described “life and business strategist.” At one of his seminars last month, Robbins responded to audience member Nanine McCool, who said, “I think you misunderstand the #MeToo movement.” Robbins said, “I’m not knocking the #MeToo movement, I’m knocking victimhood.” Referencing a video of the exchange, Burke tweeted that Robbins “completely misrepresent[ed]” the movement, saying it’s “NOT about victimization it’s about SURVIVORS.” Robbins later apologized.
The #MeToo movement seeks to end sexual violence through speaking up about alleged crimes.
The exchange at Robbins’ event
Robbins, who has also described himself as an “authority on leadership psychology,” was giving an “Unleash the Power Within” seminar on March 15 in San Jose, at a stadium of about 12,000 people. According to Robbins’ website, the 3 1/2 day event is “designed to help you unlock and unleash the forces inside that can help you break through any limit and create the quality of life you desire.” 
Attendee Adisa Ramla told VICE that Robbins had talked about “motivating factors” in life, including “significance.” Ramla noted what Robbins said, “in a nutshell,” was “that women in the #MeToo movement were motivated by this same factor (to be significant).” Robbins’ remarks about #MeToo prior to McCool’s comments are not shown on the video Burke originally tweeted about, or the longer video of the exchange she later tweeted.
After McCool said she thought Robbins misunderstood the movement, Robbins responded, “You can use the #MeToo movement to be such a beautiful thing. I’m not knocking the #MeToo movement, I’m knocking victimhood.” He added, “I’m not suggesting that you have to agree with me. I’m suggesting you consider what its impact is.”
Robbins added, “What you’re seeing is people making themselves significant by making somebody else wrong and getting certainty. And there’s nothing wrong with that, it just won’t make you happy. It won’t make them better, it won’t make you better.”
Robbins also said, ""If you use the #MeToo movement to try to get significance and certainty by attacking and destroying someone else, you haven’t grown an ounce, all you’ve done is basically used a drug called significance to make yourself feel good.”
McCool then addressed Robbins, “I hear you mischaracterizing the #MeToo movement, certainly there are people who are using it for their own personal devices, but there are also a significant number of people who are using it not … to relive whatever ... happened to them, but to make it safe for the young women.” She added, “I think you do the whole movement a disservice by characterizing [it] with that.”
Robbins called McCool to the stage and told her to “put out your fist,” which she did. With a straight arm, he then pressed his fist against hers. He pushed forward and she walked backwards while their fists were in contact. Robbins said, “When you push someone else, it doesn’t make you more safe. It just makes them angry.” 
Robbins then talked about a “very famous man, very powerful man” who had interviewed two men and a “very attractive” woman for a position. Robbins said the interviewer told him the woman was better qualified for the job, and that he did not hire her — that he “knew” it was “too big of a risk” to “have her around.” Robbins added that he himself had a dozen men “tell [him] this.” McCool then said, “It’s a lame excuse.”
Robbins replied, “No, you’re giving me an excuse. You’re telling me that the more I push, the more I’m going to be safe.” McCool said, “No, no.” 
After further exchange, McCool again said Robbins was “doing a disservice, in my opinion, to the #MeToo movement,” and that he “characterized an entire movement.” Robbins replied, “I’m not saying the movement is wrong, I’m saying everything has a consequence.” He added, “You want to use things in a way that doesn’t addict you to your problems, and you don’t want to be a victim.”
Burke’s tweets on Saturday
On Saturday, Burke tweeted 11 times about Robbins and #MeToo, not including replies to others’ tweets. She tweeted, “We have a hard enough time trying to shift the narrative about what this movement really is.” She added that Robbins “completely” misrepresented the movement. Regarding “survivors,” Burke said, “We want safety. We want healing. We want accountability. We want closure. We want to live a life free from shame.”
Burke also sent five points to Robbins on Twitter: 
1. #MeToo “is NOT about victimization it’s about SURVIVORS”; 
2. “Women are not to blame for the deep seeded misogyny that you and men like your ‘friend’ are mired in”;
3. “Survivors are not complicit in their own abuse. Speaking our truth is part of healing not a ploy to gain ‘significance’ – [because] when does that even HAPPEN?!”;
4. “Physical intimidation can be a form or (sic) harassment. Rewatch that video and then watch your step homie”;
5. “This movement is about making sure survivors have the resources to heal AFTER they’ve said #metoo, it’s about galvanizing a global community or (sic) survivors and advocates to do the work of interrupting sexual violence. It’s about protecting folks’ human dignity at all cost.”
Robbins response on Sunday
In a Sunday Facebook post, Robbins said “my comments [at the San Jose event] failed to reflect the respect I have for everything Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement has (sic) achieved. I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement. Let me clearly say, I agree with the goals of the #MeToo movement and its founding message of ‘empowerment through empathy,’ which makes it a beautiful force for good.”
He also said, “Sometimes, the teacher has to become the student and it is clear that I still have much to learn.”

30648,2018-04-10,Syria invites inspectors to alleged chemical attack site,"The Syrian government on Tuesday invited international inspectors to visit the site of an alleged poison gas attack in the town of Douma, near Damascus. Douma had reportedly been held by the militant group “Jaish al-Islam,” which opposes the Syrian government. 
The alleged chemical attack occurred on Saturday, killing at least 60 people and wounding more than 1,000 others. According to AP, the opposition group has attributed the attack to Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. The Syrian and Russian governments have denied the allegations.
Syria’s Foreign Ministry said it will help the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) investigate the alleged attack. The OPCW’s technical Secretariat has requested that the Syrian government make arrangements for the inspection.
A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, “Syria is keen on cooperating with the OPCW to uncover the truth behind the allegations that some Western sides have been advertising to justify their aggressive intentions,” according to state news agency SANA. 
The U.S. has not determined what materials were used in the alleged attack or who may be responsible. President Trump has said the U.S. will respond “forcefully” once responsibility for the attack is established. The White House said Tuesday that Trump will not travel to the Summit of the Americas in Peru so that he can focus on Syria.
Reuters, citing Russia-based news agency RIA, reported that about 3,600 militants and their families have left Douma over the past 24 hours, surrendering the city to Syrian government forces.

30651,2018-04-10,Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before Senate committees,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified for nearly five hours before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday about the social media platform’s handling of user data.
 
 It is the first of two scheduled hearings on Facebook’s data sharing practices. The second hearing will be held Wednesday before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
According to The Guardian, 44 senators each had five minutes to question Zuckerberg. Senators questioned the CEO on issues such as “hate speech,” political bias, data collection, regulations, social media addiction, and political ad purchases. They also questioned Zuckerberg on the company’s terms of service agreement, whether the company may be considered a monopoly, and Facebook’s involvement with data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.
Last week, the company said the data of as many as 87 million users, about 82 percent of them from the U.S., had been “improperly shared” with Cambridge Analytica. 
In his opening statement, Zuckerberg said Cambridge Analytica “improperly accessed [Facebook user] information by buying it.” He said the company planned to investigate every app on its platform to “make sure no other app developers out there are misusing data.” Zuckerberg also apologized for the company’s inability to prevent the platform from being used to disseminate “fake news” stories, and for its role in “improperly” sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica.
Zuckerberg entered the Senate committee room at 2:29 p.m. Eastern, and the hearing ended around 7:27 p.m., accounting for short breaks.
Excerpts from questions and testimony 
During the hearing, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked Zuckerberg how many other instances of improper data transfer have occurred, to which Zuckerberg replied that the company is currently conducting an audit to determine that. 
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) asked Zuckerberg what the company was doing to address so-called “hate speech” on the platform. Zuckerberg noted that Facebook plans to increase staff and enhance artificial intelligence. 
“I am optimistic, that over a five- to 10-year period we will have [artificial intelligence] tools that can get into some of the linguistic nuances of different types of content to be more accurate in flagging things for our systems,” Zuckerberg said. “But today we're just not there on that. So a lot of this [is] still reactive. People flag it to us, we have people look at it, we have policies to make it as not subjective as possible. But until we get more automated there’s a higher error rate than I am happy with.”
Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) asked whether Facebook employees worked directly with any Cambridge Analytica employees during the 2016 presidential campaign. Zuckerberg said he didn’t know. “I know we did help out the Trump campaign overall in sales support” in the “same way that we [do] with all other campaigns,” he added.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) asked whether Facebook employees had been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office. While Zuckerberg confirmed that Facebook employees had been interviewed, he could not state whether they had been subpoenaed. The CEO said he had not personally spoken with the investigation. 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) questioned whether Facebook has a political bias. Zuckerberg said he tries to make sure Facebook doesn't have any bias.
Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) asked Zuckerberg to describe the type of user data that Facebook collects. Zuckerberg said the two primary data categories include content that a person has chosen to share, and data that is used to make ads relevant to users who see it.
When questioned by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) about Facebook’s role in alleged Russian election interference, Zuckerberg said Facebook planned to increase its security team by more than 20,000 people to help verify the advertisers who post ads considered to be about either political or social “issues,” to prevent the type of “interference” experienced in the 2016 election. Zuckerberg also noted that he could not “guarantee” that fake political ads would not appear on Facebook again.

30612,2018-04-10,"Yulia Skripal, daughter of poisoned former Russian spy, discharged from UK hospital","Yulia Skripal, who was poisoned with a nerve agent on March 4 along with her father, a former Russian spy, has been discharged from the hospital. “This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone,” said the hospital's deputy chief executive Christine Blanshard. Yulia, 33, left Salisbury District Hospital on Monday and was taken to a secure location, according to BBC. 
Skripal’s father, Sergei Skripal, remains hospitalized. “Although he's recovering more slowly than Yulia we hope he too will be able to leave hospital in due course,” Blanshard said.
Last month, Yulia and her father were taken to the hospital after being found unconscious on a park bench. Remnants of a nerve agent were found on the Skripal’s front doorknob. British officials also found traces of the chemical at two places the Skripals had visited on the day of the attack. France, Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. assessed that it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the attack. Russia has denied involvement.
In a tweet on Tuesday, the U.K.’s Russian embassy released a statement that said, “we congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery,” and asked for “urgent proof” that she was reportedly moved to a “secure location” out of “her free will.”
British scientists have identified the chemical used in the attack as “Novichok.” According to AFP, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organization, has not yet verified the U.K.’s findings.
In 2004, Russian authorities arrested Skripal for providing the British intelligence service MI6 with the names of Russian agents. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006. He was released and moved to the U.K. four years later as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI.

“The president is grateful for Tom’s commitment to the safety and security of our great country,” Sanders said in a statement. “Tom led the White House’s efforts to protect the homeland from terrorist threats, strengthen our cyber defenses, and respond to an unprecedented series of natural disasters. President Trump thanks him for his patriotic service and wishes him well.”
The White House said that Rob Joyce, cyber security coordinator, would replace Bossert as the acting homeland security adviser. According to Reuters, Bossert left at the request of Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, who started working for the White House on Monday after replacing Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.
The role of homeland security adviser is also known as the “Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.” The person in the position advises the president on “homeland security and counterterrorism policy issues as well as cybersecurity, biodefense, and global health security,” according to the White House, and coordinates with the Cabinet.

30490,2018-04-10,FBI raids home and office of Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen,"On Monday, FBI agents raided the home and office of Michael Cohen, personal lawyer to President Donald Trump. The agents, from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, executed search warrants and took possession of communications between Cohen and his clients, emails, tax documents and business records, according to The New York Times. 
Cohen’s own lawyer, Stephen Ryan, said in a statement, “I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. 
Ryan said the seizure of protected attorney client communications was “unnecessary” and that “Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath."" Ryan did not specify what records were taken. 
Among other records, the FBI obtained documents related to Cohen’s payment of $130,000 to former adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, stage name Stormy Daniels, for signing a non-disclosure agreement regarding her alleged 2006 extramarital affair with Trump, The New York Times reported. The White House denies the allegations that an affair took place between Clifford and Trump.
The Washington Post reported late Monday night that, according to three people familiar with the case, Cohen was being investigated for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations. 
Spokespeople for the special counsel and for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York declined to comment, according to Fox News.

30487,2018-04-10,DHS seeks contractor for ‘media monitoring’ project,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a public bid for a “traditional and social media monitoring” project to track about 290,000 news sources from around the world and to build a database of journalists, editors and social media “influencers.”
The project description says the DHS seeks a contractor to:
 

	“provide media comparison tools, design and rebranding tools, communication tools, and the ability to identify top media influencers.”
	monitor “traditional news sources as well as social media, identify any and all media coverage related to the Department of Homeland Security or a particular event.”
	instantly translate foreign language coverage into English.
	analyze the “sentiment” and “momentum” of news coverage.
	build a searchable database of “journalists, editors, correspondents, social media influencers, [and] bloggers.” Search terms would include “beat, location, outlet type/size, and journalist role.” The database would need to include “present contact details and any other information that could be relevant, including publications [the] influencer writes for, and an overview of the previous coverage published by the media influencer.”

Homeland Security Press Secretary Tyler Houlton said the project was “standard practice of monitoring current events in the media.”
The public bid was posted online on the Federal Business Opportunities website on April 3, with bids due by April 13. Seven companies have expressed interest in the project, according to the website.

30473,2018-04-10,Arizona deploys 225 troops to US-Mexico border,"On Monday, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey deployed 225 state National Guard members to assist the Border Patrol at the U.S.-Mexico border in the Tucson and Yuma sectors. The troops were sent to the town of Marana, northwest of Tucson, according to Ducey’s spokesperson, Patrick Ptak. Ducey said on Twitter that additional National Guard members would be deployed Tuesday. 
Last week, President Donald Trump said, “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military.” On Friday, Defense Secretary James Mattis signed a memo approving U.S. Department of Defense funding through September for up to 4,000 troops along the border. The troops will be armed only in “circumstances that might require self-defense,” and will not “perform law enforcement activities or interact with migrants” without Mattis’ approval, according to the department memo. They will assist Border Patrol agents with supporting tasks, according to Politico.
The Arizona deployment is scheduled for 31 days, with the possibility of extension, and will be paid with federal funds, according to Ptak.
Also on Friday, the Texas Army National Guard said 250 guardsmen would be deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border in the following 72 hours. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he would commit at least 1,000 guardsmen. The guardsmen were to bring aircraft, vehicles and surveillance equipment with them, according to Reuters.
New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez’s office said it would be deploying 250 guardsmen, including 80 later this week. None have yet been deployed. 
California has not decided whether or not to send its National Guard troops to support border control. California National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Keegan said last week that the request would be “promptly reviewed to determine how best we can assist our federal partners.”

30755,2018-04-11,Trump executive order calls for reform of US ‘welfare system’,"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order entitled “Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility.” The order calls for reform of the U.S. “welfare system,” including “strengthening” rules requiring people to work in order to receive government assistance, known as work requirements. The order instructs eight cabinet secretaries to review their public assistance “regulations and guidance documents” based on nine “Principles of Economic Mobility.”
A White House Fact Sheet on the executive order said that “adding or enforcing work requirements for able-bodied adults on welfare is an effective solution to help millions of Americans regain their independence.” It also outlined the nine “Principles of Economic Mobility” as follows:

	“improve employment outcomes and economic independence;
	promote marriage and family as a way of escaping poverty;
	address the challenges of hard-to-employ populations;
	provide more flexibility to States, while ensuring accountability for achieving outcomes;
	streamline services to more effectively use taxpayer resources;
	reserve benefits for those truly in need;
	consolidate duplicative programs;
	facilitate greater sharing of information between States and localities; and
	empower the private sector to find solutions to poverty.”

“Part of President Trump’s effort to create a booming American economy includes moving Americans from welfare to work and supporting and encouraging others to support common-sense reforms that restore American prosperity and help them reclaim their independence,” White House adviser Andrew Bremberg said on Tuesday.
Under the order, secretaries are to submit recommended regulatory and policy changes to the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days. Each department would have 90 days after its submission of recommendations to begin implementing them. In addition to recommendations for policy changes, the order calls for secretaries to review the enforcement of current government assistance work requirements to determine if they are “consistent” with federal law and the nine “principles.”
The eight secretaries to perform the reviews are from the Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation and Treasury Departments. 
Federal assistance programs for which work requirements are currently in place or could be changed or added include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) (“welfare”), Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Failure to comply with work requirements can result in disqualification from federal assistance programs. For instance, able-bodied adults without dependents must work or participate in a work program at least 20 hours per week to receive SNAP benefits for more than 3 months in a 36-month period, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Some exceptions apply, such as for pregnant women and people with physical or mental health exemptions. The USDA defines an “able-bodied adult without dependents” as a person between the ages of 18 and 49 who has no dependents and is not disabled.
The order says “The Federal Government’s role is to clear paths to self-sufficiency, reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need.” It also says it is the government’s “duty” to either “improve or eliminate” policies that are not succeeding in terms of principles of work, free enterprise, and safeguarding human and economic resources.
The order calls for metrics to “measure outcomes” so that “agencies administering public assistance programs can be held accountable.” It adds that agencies should “enforce all relevant laws” so that benefits are not provided to aliens who are “not otherwise qualified and eligible.”
This year, the Department of Health and Human Services granted a waiver to Arkansas to allow it to require 80 hours per month of work, job training and/or job searching to qualify for Medicaid benefits. Maine and Kansas have work requirements for some public assistance programs. Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin are currently implementing work requirements, the White House said.
Some statistics on employment and government assistance programs
According to the White House’s Fact Sheet:

	As of January 2018, 74 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. 
	More than 97 percent of people who work full-time “move out” of poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
	More than 16 million “able-bodied” adults were enrolled in SNAP in 2016.
	28 million “able-bodied” adults are enrolled in Medicaid.
	Welfare enrollment is at or near record highs for “able-bodied” adults in America.
	The U.S. unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, the lowest it’s been since 2000.

According to the Department of Agriculture, 44 percent of households receiving SNAP benefits had at least one person working.
In a 2017 study, the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy found about three-quarters of people enrolled in Michigan’s Medicaid program were working or were physically unable to work, and 12 percent of enrollees may be exempt from work requirements due to being students or above a certain age.
Millions of people who receive government aid are exempt from current work requirements because they volunteer, provide care for relatives, or are in training programs, according to The New York Times.

30750,2018-04-11,Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before House committee,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for nearly five hours on Wednesday, a day after testifying before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees. As he did the day before, Zuckerberg began by apologizing for the company not doing “enough” to prevent Facebook from being used for “harm” resulting from “fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech.”
In his testimony, Zuckerberg said Facebook has 200 people who are working on counterterrorism on the site, using methods that the company wrote about in a blog post last year. In regard to regulation, Zuckerberg said, ""The internet is growing in importance around the world ... I think it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.”
When Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.) mentioned people selling opioids on Facebook, Zuckerberg responded, “I think there are a number of areas of content we need to do a better job of policing on our service.”
Facebook said last week that data from as many as 87 million users had been “improperly shared” with Cambridge Analytica, a company that used the data to aid the election campaigns of its clients, including Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said Cambridge Analytica may have obtained his personal user data as well.
Each of the 55 committee members was allotted four minutes to speak and ask questions. Before ending the session, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, said some questions that representatives did not get to ask may be submitted in writing within 10 business days and he asked Zuckerberg to submit responses to those questions within 10 business days of receiving them.

30716,2018-04-11,"House Speaker Paul Ryan announces retirement, won’t run for re-election","House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced Wednesday he would retire next January and would not seek re-election. Ryan, 48, said, “If I am here for one more term, my kids will only ever have known me as a weekend Dad — I just can’t let that happen.” He said he thought Congress had achieved a “heck of a lot” since he was elected Speaker in 2015, replacing retiring Speaker John Boehner. 
Ryan said he gave the job “everything [he had]” and he has “no regrets.” Ryan spoke of his successful efforts to increase defense spending in the $1.3 trillion appropriations bill passed in March and to pass tax reform in December of last year. He said, “I see these as lasting victories that make this country more prosperous and more secure for decades to come.”
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump tweeted that Ryan is “a truly good man and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question.”
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said of Ryan, “Despite our differences, I commend his steadfast commitment to our country.”
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) or House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) is “most likely” to replace Ryan, according to The Washington Post.
Ryan ran for vice president with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012 against former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden. Before becoming speaker, Ryan served as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and before that as chairman of the House Budget Committee. Ryan has served in the House representing Wisconsin’s 1st congressional district since 1999. He has one daughter and two sons.

30839,2018-04-12,"Tesla issues statement on fatal Model X collision, withdraws from NTSB agreement","Tesla Inc. withdrew on Wednesday from a party agreement with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that was part of the NTSB’s investigation into a fatal Model X collision with a concrete barrier on March 23 in California. The agreement with the NTSB had prohibited Tesla from publicly sharing information on the collision while the investigation was ongoing. Tesla said it would “continue to provide technical assistance to the NTSB.” 
Walter Huang, 38, was killed in the collision while Tesla’s semi-autonomous Autopilot system was engaged.
Tesla said on Wednesday that it withdrew from the NTSB agreement because it “requires that we not release information about Autopilot to the public, a requirement which we believe fundamentally affects public safety negatively.” The company said it “believe[s] in transparency, so an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable.”
In addition to two previous statements on the March 23 collision, Tesla issued a statement on Tuesday saying, “according to the family, Mr. Huang was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he told them it was not reliable in that exact location [of the collision], yet he nonetheless engaged Autopilot” there. Tesla added that the collision appeared on a day with “several hundred feet of visibility” which “means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.”
The company also said Autopilot “requires the driver to be alert and have hands on the wheel,” and that the system gave alerts, both visual and auditory, “several times” to Huang when his hands were not on the wheel during his March 23 drive.
On Thursday, NTSB said in a statement that it had removed Tesla from its agreement “because Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB. Such releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.”
Tesla released a statement on Thursday evening, saying it would make an “official complaint to Congress” regarding NTSB’s release of “partial bits of incomplete information to the media,” which Tesla said was in violation of NTSB’s rules. In its statement earlier on Thursday, NTSB said, “Transparency in the investigative process is achieved through the public release of on-scene information, preliminary reports, and the public docket, as well as through board meetings that are open to the public.”
NTSB said its “thorough” investigations “generally” take 12 to 24 months and that Tesla was still in party agreements with the agency for investigations into two previous accidents: one involving a Model X in August 2017 in Lake Forest, California, and one with a Model S in January 2018 near Culver City, California.
In January 2017, NTSB released a report about 6 1/2 months after a separate fatal Tesla crash involving a Model S while Autopilot was engaged. NTSB said it found no defect in the Autopilot system and that Tesla had updated the system since that crash.

30834,2018-04-12,Trump asks advisors to study US re-entering trans-Pacific trade deal negotiations,"President Donald Trump asked his trade advisers to examine the possibility of re-entering negotiations for a trans-Pacific trade agreement if the U.S. arranged favorable terms, the president said at a meeting with lawmakers on Thursday. Trump authorized the U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and the director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow to look into the possibility of re-joining such an agreement, more than a year after withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
Also on Thursday, Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the National Economic Council, said while in London that re-entering a trans-Pacific trade agreement was “something that’s of interest” if negotiations were satisfactory.
On Jan. 23 of last year, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the TPP, which was negotiated to remove tariff and trade regulations among 12 countries but had not yet been approved by Congress. Trump had said during the presidential campaign that the TPP was “pushed by special interests” and disadvantageous to the U.S. 
In January of this year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said in a speech that the U.S. would consider negotiating” with the TPP members “either individually or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all.”
In March of this year, 11 nations signed a new trans-Pacific trade agreement that did not include the U.S., called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The countries that signed the new deal were Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

30829,2018-04-12,International chemical weapons group confirms ‘novichok’ used in Skripals’ poisoning,"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OCPW), an international chemical weapons group, reported on Thursday that military-grade “novichok” nerve agent was used to poison former Russian Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the U.K. city of Salisbury last month. The OCPW’s findings confirm the U.K. government’s determination that novichok was used. Novichok (Russian for “newcomer”) was originally developed and created by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s. Russia has denied involvement in the poisoning incident. 
Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4, and taken to the hospital. Yulia Skripal, 33, was released from the hospital earlier this week, and reportedly taken to a “secure location.” The Russian embassy in the U.K. released a statement that said, “we congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery,” and asked for “urgent proof” that she was reportedly moved to a “secure location” out of “her free will.” Her father remains in the hospital.
Sergei Skripal is a former Russian spy who, after being arrested, sentenced and then released in Russia, moved to the U.K. as part of an exchange for Russian spies arrested by the FBI.
The OCPW, which implements the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, sent investigators to the U.K. on March 19 to test samples. After testing environmental and biomedical samples in four laboratories, the organization determined that the nerve agent was “high purity,” and confirmed the U.K.’s finding about which particular strain it was. The OCPW did not draw a conclusion about the origin of the novichok, or who was responsible for the poisoning. 
OPCW Russian representative Alexander Vasilievich Shulgin said earlier this month that his country had nothing to do with the poisoning and that it had the appearance of a “terrorist attack.” He has said Russia would reject the results of the OPCW investigation if it was not allowed to participate in the testing of Salisbury samples.
British Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was “highly likely” to be responsible for the attack and expelled Russian diplomats. More than 20 other countries expelled a total of 150 Russian diplomats, in support of the U.K. determination. Russia responded by saying it would expel a total of 150 diplomats from those countries.

30826,2018-04-12,New Zealand: No new offshore oil and gas exploration permits to be issued,"New Zealand announced on Thursday it would stop issuing permits for oil and gas exploration off its shores, saying the decision was aimed at reducing carbon emissions. The government said exploration could continue with permits that it had already issued. Referring to climate change, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, “We are committed to the goal of becoming a net zero emissions economy by 2050.” She said her goal is for all of the electricity New Zealand uses to come from renewable energy sources by 2035. 
The Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand said the government’s decision is a “lose-lose for New Zealand’s economy and environment, likely to threaten jobs” and would “mean higher prices for consumers.” It also said the move would mean “other countries will produce [oil] instead and we will have to import it at higher cost.” It added that more than 11,000 people work in the oil and gas industries during “peak times,” and that jobs would be affected given that companies had made “huge” investments anticipating offshore “block offers,” which would not be made under the government’s announcement. 
The government said the oil industry should pursue other opportunities in energy, such as the mining of solar cell materials, CNN reported.
Ardern said, “There are 31 oil and gas exploration permits currently active, 22 are offshore.” She said these permits “run as far out as 2030 and could go an additional 40 years under a mining permit.”
New Zealand exports about $1.1 billion worth of oil per year, less than it imports, according to The New York Times. About 80 percent of the energy for New Zealand’s 4.7 million people currently comes from renewable energy sources, according to Bloomberg.
Ardern became prime minister when her Labour Party formed a coalition with the Green and Free Parties after parliamentary elections in September of last year.

30776,2018-04-12,Trump says missiles ‘will be coming’ in Syria after Saturday’s alleged chemical attack in Douma (Update),"On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted the following: “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’” On Monday, Trump had said “nothing’s off the table,” referring to a potential military response to an alleged chemical attack that killed at least 40 people in Douma on Saturday. The Russian and Syrian governments have denied that a chemical attack occurred.
On Thursday, Trump tweeted, “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!”
Trump’s Wednesday tweet came after Alexander Zasypkin, Russian ambassador to Lebanon, told Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV on Tuesday that ""if there is a strike by the Americans, then we refer to the statements of President Putin and the chief of staff that the missiles will be downed and even the sources from which the missiles were fired.” Russian chief of staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov said in March that Moscow would shoot down missiles and attack launch sites if Russian armed forces in Syria were threatened, Al Jazeera reported. Gerasimov also said militants in Syria were planning on staging chemical attacks as if the government had ordered them, with “civilians” sent to “play victims” in eastern Ghouta.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, “smart missiles should be fired at terrorists and not at the legitimate government which has been fighting terrorists.”
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was “deeply alarmed” by reports of the alleged chemical attack. It said 43 out of more than 70 people who reportedly died while taking shelter in a basement had deaths “related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals.” It added that about 500 patients seen by local hospitals and clinics showed symptoms consistent with toxic chemical exposure. The Russian Defense Military said WHO’s statement was “unfounded” and that reports of a chemical attack were a “fabrication and provocation.” 
On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the area of the alleged chemical attack was “in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world.” U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday that the U.S. and its allies were “still assessing the intelligence” to determine who was responsible for the alleged chemical attack.
On Tuesday, Syria invited international inspectors to visit the site of the alleged attack. The same day, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said it would deploy a “fact-finding” mission to Douma. Also on Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council rejected a draft resolution by the U.S. and another by Russia that proposed setting up a group of experts to investigate chemical weapons attacks in Syria, Al Jazeera reported.
Lt. Gen. Viktor Poznikhir, deputy chief of operations of the Russian General Staff, said Russian military police would be in Douma on Friday.
British Prime Minister Theresa May said “the use of chemical weapons cannot go unchallenged.” She said the U.K. would be working with allies to “consider how we can ensure that those responsible are held to account” and “how we can prevent and deter the humanitarian catastrophe of the use of chemical weapons in the future.""
French President Emmanuel Macron has said “chemical weapons capabilities” could be targets of a “strong and joint response” to Syria. Macron said Thursday that he has “proof” that Syria used chemical weapons in Saturday’s attack in Douma.
The White House said Trump canceled a trip to Latin America scheduled to begin Friday due to the situation in Syria. 
In his next tweet on Wednesday, Trump wrote, “Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?”
Since government bombing of Eastern Ghouta began on February 18, more than 1,600 civilians have been killed there, according to Al Jazeera.
In April 2017, the U.S. responded to an alleged nerve-agent attack by the Syrian government by firing more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base.

30973,2018-04-13,The Simpsons' addresses criticism of Indian character Apu,"On Sunday, the Fox network aired a new episode of “The Simpsons” television show titled, “No Good Read Goes Unpunished.” During the episode, the show addressed recent criticism regarding a character named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.
Apu is an Indian character who owns a convenience store. In a 2017 documentary titled “The Problem with Apu,” Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu criticized the character’s portrayal of South Asians and referred to Apu’s portrayal on the show as “racist.” 
Sunday’s episode
At one point in Sunday’s episode of “The Simpsons”, Marge Simpson reads her daughter, Lisa, a book from Marge’s childhood called, “The Princess in the Garden.” Marge revises the book to modernize it — for example, she replaces the main character who has “many native servants” with a “cisgender girl” who “fights” for “wild horse rescue” and “net neutrality.” After doing so, Marge says the story is “as inoffensive as a Sunday in Cincinnati.”
In response, Lisa says it “sounds like [the revised main character] starts out pretty perfect,” adding, “since she’s already evolved, she doesn’t really have an emotional journey to complete.” Marge replies, “Nope.” Lisa continues, “Kinda means there’s no point to the book.” Marge responds by saying, “Well, what am I supposed to do?” Lisa says, “It’s hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?” The cartoon then shows a photo next to Lisa’s bed of Apu, signed with the words “Don’t have a cow, Apu.”
Marge then says, “Some things will be dealt with at a later date,” to which Lisa replies, “if at all.” The two then look at the audience.
The documentary
In the documentary, Kondabolu said he didn’t “hate” the show and that he actually  “always loved” it. He told USA Today before his documentary’s premiere that Apu’s character “is funny. It has nothing to do with the character being funny, (but at the same time) it’s insulting, it’s inaccurate and it represents a larger problem where people don’t get to speak for themselves.” On the TruTV website for the documentary, it calls Apu a “stereotypical character.”
Apu is voiced by white actor Hank Azaria, who said after Kondabolu’s documentary last year that he thought it “made some really interesting points and gave us a lot at ‘The Simpsons’ to think about and we really are thinking about it.” He added, “definitely anybody that was hurt or offended by it, by any character or vocal ... performance, is (sic) really upsetting that that was offensive or hurtful to anybody.” Azaria declined to be interviewed in the documentary.
Response to Sunday’s episode 
After the show, Kondabolu tweeted, “Wow. ‘Politically Incorrect?’ That’s the takeaway from my movie  why this is important. The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress.”
Others also tweeted criticism of the show. After Sunday’s episode, stand-up comedian W. Kamau Bell tweeted, “The Simpsons, 1989 - 2018 #RIP,” and, “I think the fact that they put this ‘argument’ in the mouth of Lisa's character, the character who usually champions the underdogs and is supposed to be the most thoughtful and liberal, is what makes this the most ridiculous (as in worthy of ridicule) and toothless response.” Kondabolu had appeared on FX’s “Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell” in 2012, and did a routine about Apu on the show. 
One of “The Simpsons” writers, Al Jean, tweeted before the show, “New Simpsons in five minutes. Twitter explosion in act three.”

30856,2018-04-13,Sri Lankan president suspends parliament until May 8,"On Thursday, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena suspended his country’s parliament until May 8. His secretary Austin Fernando did not provide a reason for the suspension, according to Reuters. Parliament had been scheduled to have one more session before May 8. The suspension follows a vote in the Sri Lankan parliament last week to reject a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Votes of no confidence indicate that the parliament no longer supports the government’s leadership and can lead to the dissolution of the government.
In January 2015, Wickremesinghe appointed Arjuna Mahendran, a Singaporean, as central bank governor. Mahendran was later accused of illegally aiding his son-in-law in a treasury bond sale; Mahendran denied wrongdoing. A parliamentary committee and a presidential commission investigated the bond sales and determined the prime minister was not guilty of any wrongdoing in the case, according to Lakshman Kiriella, the Leader of the House.
On Wednesday, six ministers from the president’s Freedom Party resigned their positions in the Cabinet, while staying in parliament. They, along with 10 state and deputy ministers who also resigned, had voted for the no-confidence motion. The 16 officials left the national unity government and said they would join the the opposition party in parliament. 
“We were to cross over and sit with the opposition on April 19. Now we will do that on May 8,” said Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, one of the 16 lawmakers who joined the opposition. 
Sirisena appointed four temporary ministers, and said he would appoint a new cabinet, to be sworn in on April 23, according to Reuters. 
Wickremesinghe is a member of the United National Party, which is in a coalition with Sirisena’s Freedom Party.

31009,2018-04-14,"US, UK and France launch strikes on Syrian targets","President Donald Trump announced Friday night that he ordered the U.S. military to launch strikes on Syrian targets in response to an alleged poison gas chemical attack by the Syrian government earlier this week. The Syrian government has denied allegations of the attack and invited international inspectors to the site.
“I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapon capabilities of Syrian dictator of Bashar al-Assad,” Trump said from the White House Diplomatic Room shortly after 9 p.m. local time. 
The president said the strikes were launched in coordination with France and the U.K. “The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power: military, economic and diplomatic,” he said.
The attacks were carried out by manned aircraft and ships that launched cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea. Around 4 a.m. local time, the missiles and bombs hit a scientific research center near Damascus and two chemical weapons facilities west of the city of Homs, according to Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the facilities in Homs was used to produce the nerve agent sarin, he said. 
The Russian military said Syrian air defense units shot down 71 out of 103 cruise missiles fired by the allies. Syrian state-owned television said 13 missiles had been shot down by Syrian air defenses near the town of Al-Kiswa. 
U.S. officials disputed those statements, saying 105 weapons were launched and they all hit their targets. No aircraft or missiles involved in the operation “were successfully engaged by Syrian air defenses” according to Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. He said the U.S. was not aware of any civilian casualties.
Trump said the goal of the strike was to “establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons,” and that the U.S. was “prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.”
Trump tweeted on Saturday morning: “A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!”
The alleged chemical attack in the town of Douma, about 10 miles east of Damascus, reportedly killed at least 40 people and injured more than 500.

30997,2018-04-14,"Russia says alleged chemical attack in Syria was ‘staged,’ UK had ‘direct involvement’","Russia’s Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a Friday briefing that the alleged April 7 chemical attack in Douma, Syria was “staged.” He said people in the recordings of the alleged chemical attack were actually patients with “smoke poisoning” and that their relatives poured water on them “after a false claim that chemical weapons were used.”

Russia’s Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia said there was “no credible confirmation of toxic substance use in Douma” and that “what took place” was “a provocation.” Konashenkov also said the Russian military “has evidence that Britain had a direct involvement in arranging this provocation.” Britain’s Ambassador to the U.N., Karen Pierce, said the accusations were “a blatant lie,” adding that the U.K. “would never” be involved in using a chemical weapon.
Inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are scheduled to arrive in Douma on Saturday to investigate, according to RT. 
The town of Ghouta was under control of the rebel group “Jaish al-Islam,” or Army of Islam, from 2012 until Thursday of this week. The group opposes Syrian President Bashar Assad.
Timeline of alleged events

	February 2018: Assad’s forces begin an offensive in eastern Ghouta, where Douma is located.
	April 6: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group, reports that Assad’s forces conducted airstrikes on Douma. Syrian state TV says the rebel fighters had shelled two areas, including a residential area.
	April 7: The Syrian American Medical Society says a chemical gas attack in Douma killed 41 and injured hundreds.
	Also April 7: State-run news reports that a military airbase near the city of Homs was attacked by missiles. 
	April 8: Russia’s Maj. Gen. Yuri Yevtushenko says the Russian military has negotiated an agreement between the Syrian government and the Army of Islam to evacuate 8,000 of the rebels and about 40,000 of their family members from Douma.
	April 9: U.S. President Donald Trump says, “nothing’s off the table,” referring to a potential military response to the alleged chemical attack.
	April 10: Alexander Zasypkin, the Russian ambassador to Lebanon, says, “if there is a strike by the Americans, then we refer to the statements of President Putin and the chief of staff that the missiles will be downed and even the sources from which the missiles were fired.” He makes the statement on Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV. 
	April 11: Trump tweets, “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’”

31000,2018-04-14,"Israeli gunfire kills 1 Palestinian, injures more than 200 in Gaza protests","One Palestinian protester was killed and 233 injured from live fire by Israeli forces on Friday during ongoing protests along the Gaza border with Israel, the Gaza Health Ministry reported. The Ministry said a total of 969 were injured on Friday. In total, 34 Palestinians have been killed, including 27 along the border, since protests began on March 30. Tens of thousands of protesters have attended demonstrations at five locations along the border, according to the Israeli army.
Palestinians began demonstrations and sit-ins on the anniversary of “Land Day.” The protests are scheduled to last more than six weeks and end on May 15, known as “Nakba Day.” Land Day is held in remembrance of an incident in which Israeli forces fatally shot six Palestinians on March 30, 1976, as the Palestinians were protesting Israeli land seizures. “Nakba Day” recognizes the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries.

The protests, called “The March of Return,” are calling for Palestinians who left Israeli areas during and around the May 1948 war and their descendants to be granted the “right to return” to those areas. Israel said it will not allow the right of return.
Israeli snipers have shot protesters that the Israeli military said had approached the border fence. Israel has also used rubber bullets and tear gas on Palestinian protesters. Prior to Friday, Israeli forces injured almost 1,300 Palestinians with live fire, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s count calculated through computerized tracking. An additional 1,554 Palestinians have been treated for inhalation of tear gas or injuries from rubber-coated steel pellets, Haaretz reported.
The Israeli army has called the protesters “violent rioters and terrorists,” and said it was firing only in accordance with its protocols and to prevent damage to Israel's “defense infrastructures.” An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman tweeted, “Israel will continue to defend its borders and its citizens.”
The Israeli army said some demonstrators on Friday repeatedly attempted to destroy obstacles that the army had erected. The army said some Palestinians attempted to cross the border fence, and that firebombs and Molotov cocktails were thrown. Demonstrators burned Israeli flags and raised Palestinians ones. 
During past demonstrations, some of the protesters have rolled burning tires, thrown rocks and reportedly attempted to damage the border fence. Some have said they intend to use mirrors and lasers to distract Israeli snipers, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Organizers of the protests have said they are intended to be “nonviolent resistance.” Hamas, the political group that governs Gaza, has said it would give $3,000 to the families of anyone killed in the protests and $500 or $200 to those wounded, depending on the severity of the injuries. Hamas official Mohammed Thuraya said, “This is our duty to our people, to ease the suffering of our citizens.” He said it wasn’t a “price tag” on casualties.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation into the deaths during the protests. On April 1, the U.S. blocked a draft resolution by the U.N. Security Council that called for an investigation into the deaths of the 17 Palestinian protesters who had been killed up until that point. Walter Miller, U.S. representative to the U.N., said “bad actors” were using the “protests as a cover to incite violence.”

Jason Greenblatt, the U.S. envoy to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, said in a statement, “We condemn leaders and protesters who call for violence or who send protesters – including children – to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed.”

No Israelis have been killed during the protests.

30994,2018-04-14,Trump pardons ‘Scooter’ Libby for 2007 perjury charges,"On Friday, President Donald Trump issued a full pardon to I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby for perjury charges, according to a White House statement. Libby served as chief of staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney. In 2007, Libby was convicted of four felony counts of perjury relating to an investigation into the unauthorized disclosure to the press of the identity of a CIA officer, Valerie Plame. Libby had pleaded not guilty to all charges. 
After his 2007 conviction, President George W. Bush, who was in office at the time, commuted Libby’s sentence, which was originally set for 30 months. After the commutation, Libby paid a $250,000 fine, performed 400 hours of community service, and served two years of probation, according to the White House. Libby was disbarred after his conviction and reinstated in 2016 in a decision by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. 
Plame’s identity had been revealed to journalist Robert Novak by Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, according to Fox News. No one has ever been charged for the leak.
The White House said Libby had served “more than a decade of honorable service” before his conviction, that his record is “unblemished” since, and that he “continues to be held in high regard by his colleagues and peers.” 
Trump said, “Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of [Libby’s] life.”

The U.S. Attorney's Office said it had not filed charges, and prosecutors said they have provided Cohen with the federal criminal statutes under which he is being investigated.
On Monday, FBI agents executed search warrants for Cohen’s home residence, hotel room, office, safety deposit boxes and two cell phones. The FBI took possession of some of Cohen’s communications documents. His attorneys filed a temporary restraining order Friday to prevent prosecutors from using materials that are subject to attorney-client privilege, and asked to review the material themselves.

30991,2018-04-14,Russian court bans Telegram messenger service,"A Russian court ordered the messenger app Telegram to be blocked in the country for denying Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) access to the content of messages sent through the app’s encrypted service. The ruling resulted from a petition to block the service that Roskomnadzor, the Russian federal agency in charge of communications and mass media, filed on April 6. Telegram plans to appeal the ruling.
The court blocked the app for not complying with FSB’s requests for encrypted data, in accordance with a Russian data protection law. In July of last year, the FSB requested that Telegram grant the agency access to a decryption process to view messages. The FSB has said it needs access to some messages for security reasons, including countering terrorist activity. 
Telegram declined to comply with the requests for encrypted messages, citing users’ privacy and technical challenges. A representative for the company said it considers the FSB request illegal. Additionally, company executives said that Telegram was technically unable to fulfill the requirement. 
Telegram filed legal challenges in multiple courts. Russia’s Supreme Court rejected the company’s suit on March 20 of this year, and granted Telegram 15 days to provide access to the FSB.
After Friday’s ruling, Alexander Zharov, the head of Roskomnadzor, said he would not say the “exact time when the block on Telegram will begin,” adding that it would be “soon.” Roskomnadzor’s representatives also said it would restore Telegram service if the company began complying with FSB requests for data. 
The ruling judge, Yulia Smolina of the Tagansky District Court in Moscow, said, “the court has ruled to refuse the request of the Telegram party and look into the case without participation of Telegram representatives.” Telegram’s lawyers did not attend the Friday hearing or a preliminary hearing on Thursday. A lawyer for the company, Pavel Chikov, said the app’s founder Pavel Durov had told them not to participate in the trial to not “legitimize this open farce.” 
Telegram response 
Another Telegram lawyer, Dmitry Kolbasin, said after the ruling that the legal team would obtain “today’s court decision, to study it and certainly, the lawyers plan to appeal it.”
Durov, the Telegram founder, posted about the ruling on his VKontakte page, Russia’s largest social network. “Telegram will use built-in methods to bypass blocking, which do not require action from users, although 100% accessibility of the service without VPN is not guaranteed,” he wrote. VPN is an acronym for a virtual private network; such networks can allow people to bypass internet restrictions imposed by authorities. 
Durov wrote on Telegram that “privacy is not for sale,” adding that “at Telegram, we have the luxury of not caring about revenue streams or ad sales.”
Telegram has about 200 million worldwide users, and is the world’s ninth most popular messaging app. In Russia, government officials, journalists and members of the opposition use Telegram, according to Reuters. 
Durov used to live in Russia and left the country in 2014 after selling the VKontakte social networking site, Reuters reported.

31248,2018-04-16,OPCW: International inspectors denied access to alleged Syrian chemical attack site,"As of Monday, independent international inspectors have not been granted access to inspect the site of an alleged April 7 chemical attack in the Syrian town of Douma that reportedly killed between 40 and 70 people. A team from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived in the capital city of Damascus, about 11 miles west of Douma, on Saturday. The OPCW team arrived the same day that the U.S., the U.K. and France conducted airstrikes on targets they say are associated with a Syrian chemical weapons program. Syria denied using chemical weapons.  
The OPCW “team has not yet deployed to Douma” two days after arriving in Syria, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu told the organization’s executive council. Uzumcu said that he hoped the team would be permitted to deploy to Douma “as soon as possible.” He said Syrian and Russian officials have stated “that there were still pending security issues to be worked out before any deployment could take place.” 
Syrian authorities granted the OPCW team access to 22 witnesses, according to Uzumcu. The OPCW executive council meeting was closed to the public, though the body released a prepared statement by Uzumcu. The U.K.’s OPCW delegation also tweeted that access has been denied. 
Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that the OPCW team could not access the site until it had permission from the United Nations Department for Safety and Security, since the U.S., U.K. and France conducted airstrikes on the area over the weekend. 
U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said the U.N. “has provided the necessary clearances for the OPCW team to go about its work in Douma. We have not denied the team any request for it to go to Douma.”
The Syrian government invited the OPCW inspectors to the site last Tuesday. A Syrian representative, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad, said government officials have met with the OPCW team multiple times, and the government is “fully ready” to cooperate with the inspectors.
Russian and Syrian forces have been deployed to Douma, AP reported. The town has reportedly been evacuated of all rebel forces. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, “I can guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site.”
Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov told reporters last Friday that the attack was “staged,” and people in recordings of the alleged attack were actually patients with “smoke poisoning.” 
The U.S. Department of Defense has said the U.S. is “very confident” that Syria is responsible for the alleged chemical attack. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White responded to a question about why the U.S. has not shared the evidence, saying, “a lot of this has to do with intelligence.”

31245,2018-04-16,Lawyer commits suicide by apparent self-immolation,"David S. Buckel, an attorney, was found dead in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York, on Sunday morning after lighting himself on fire. The New York Police Department said Buckel, 60, was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. and that his death was a suicide. 
 
 In an email sent to The New York Times and other news outlets before his death as well as in a note found near his body, Buckel said, “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”
For some of his career, Buckel worked at Lambda Legal, a national nonprofit organization that works to achieve “recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people” and people living with HIV. He had left Lambda Legal and was involved in environmental causes, according to The New York Times. 
During his career, Buckel worked on cases dealing with civil rights for LGBT clients, including:

	A lawsuit on behalf of Brandon Teena, a transgender man who was raped and murdered in Falls City, Nebraska, in 1993. This story was portrayed in the movie “Boys Don’t Cry,” for which Hilary Swank, playing Teena, won the Academy Award for best actress.
	The 1996 Nabozny v. Podlesny case in Wisconsin, in which the suit of Jamie Nabozny, a gay man, against his former high school led to a ruling that schools have a responsibility to provide gay and lesbian students with an environment free from harassment.
	The 2006 Lewis v. Harris case in which the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled same-sex couples were entitled to all the benefits and responsibilities of marriage.
	The 2009 Varnum v. Brien case in which the Iowa Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the right to marry. With this ruling, Iowa became the third state to legalize same-sex marriage.

31140,2018-04-16,Nations issue statements on airstrikes in Syria,"On Saturday, several nations issued statements on the attacks carried out by the U.S., U.K. and France in response to the Syrian government’s alleged chemical attack in Douma on April 7. U.S., British and French leaders conferred by phone, saying the attack had been a “success.” Canada, Germany, Israel and Turkey expressed support for the action. Russia called it an “act of aggression,” and Syria, China, Iran and the British opposition party expressed disapproval.
President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday, “Mission Accomplished!” after the bombing of three alleged chemical weapons facilities in Syria at 4 a.m. local time.
A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she “welcomed” support from other world leaders for the “strong stand the U.K., France and the United States had taken in degrading Syria’s chemical weapons capability and deterring their use, defending global rules, and sending a clear message that the use of chemical weapons can never become normalized.”
French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted, ""By working together, in a coordinated fashion, we can definitively prevent the Syrian regime from carrying out chemical attacks against its own people.” 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly said, ""This aggression will only make Syria and its people more determined to keep fighting and crushing terrorism in every inch of the country.” Syria has denied using chemical weapons on its people.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that through the strikes “the US makes the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Syria even worse and brings suffering to civilians.” He added that “the current escalation around Syria is destructive for the entire system of international relations.”
Russia called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Saturday. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, ""At this critical juncture, I call on all member states to act consistently with the charter of the United Nations and with international law, including the norms against chemical weapons.”
The U.N. rejected a resolution proposed by Russia to condemn the bombings. Nine votes were needed for the measure to pass. Russia, China and Bolivia voted for it; Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan and Peru abstained. After the vote, Russian Ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said, “Today is a very sad day for the world, the U.N., its charter, which was blatantly, blatantly violated.”
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said at the meeting, “If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said France would “take the initiative” in the Security Council on Monday “to make sure that we are moving towards a peaceful settlement of the Syrian crisis.”
Other international reactions
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, “We consistently oppose the use of force in international relations, and advocate respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries.” She added, “China urges all the relevant parties to return to the framework of international law and to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “We support the fact that our U.K. and French allies took on responsibility in this way as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The military strike was necessary and appropriate in order to preserve the effectiveness of the international ban on the use of chemical weapons and to warn the Syrian regime against further violations.”
British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Party said, “Bombs won’t save lives or bring about peace. This legally questionable action risks escalating further, as U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has admitted, an already devastating conflict and therefore makes real accountability for war crimes and use of chemical weapons less, not more, likely.” Some Labor Party members asked why May did not wait on military action until parliament was in session on Monday to vote on it, according to The Guardian. May said she would address parliament on the situation on Monday.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada supported the decision for the strikes “to take action to degrade the Assad regime’s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people.” 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “fully supports” the attack.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the attack a “crime,” and the U.S., British and French leaders “criminals.”
Iraq’s foreign ministry said, “Such action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent.”
The Turkish foreign ministry said the strikes were an “appropriate response” and that chemical weapons attacks against civilians “constitute crimes against humanity.”
Investigations into the alleged chemical attack
Investigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived in Damascus on Saturday. Syria has said it would allow them access to all required sites, RT reported.
Russia’s ministry of defense said the chemical attack had been “staged” and that it had “evidence that Britain had a direct involvement in arranging this provocation.” Britain denied this. 
On Thursday, Macron said he had “proof” that Syria used chemical weapons in Douma. During an interview on France's TF1 television, he reportedly said, “We have proof that chemical weapons were used last week, at least chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.”
On Saturday, a White House official said the administration believes sarin gas was used in addition to chlorine gas in Douma, AFP reported. 
Responding to a question about why the U.S. has not shared its evidence of a chemical attack, Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said, “a lot of this has to do with intelligence,” and that she would be “very happy” to show evidence if she could. She said the U.S. was “very confident” about its decision to bomb Syria. 
Dana White also said the U.S.’ mission “stays the same — it’s to defeat ISIS.” She added that the U.S. supports the U.N.-backed peace process for Syria and wants “a diplomatic, political resolution to the Syrian conflict, but civilized nations can't let what's happened in Syria stand.""

31357,2018-04-17,Starbucks to temporarily close its US stores for racial bias training,"Starbucks said on Tuesday it would close all of its more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. and its corporate offices for an afternoon on May 29 to hold racial bias training for its nearly 175,000 employees. The coffee chain’s announcement was a response to an incident at one of its Philadelphia stores last Thursday, when two African American men were arrested by police after they did not leave the store when asked to. 
In the incident, the two men walked into the store and at least one of them asked if he could use the restroom. In accordance with the store’s policy, an employee said no because the men had not bought anything. The men sat down and were asked to leave. When they did not, the store’s manager called the police. At least six police officers came and asked the men to leave three times. 
A man named Andrew Yaffe arrived and told police the men were waiting to meet with him. Lauren Wimmer, an attorney who represented the two men after they were arrested, said they were waiting to meet Yaffe to discuss investment opportunities in real estate. Police arrested the two men when they did not leave after being asked. 
People in the store recorded at least two cellphone videos of the police interacting with the men. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross said “these officers did absolutely nothing wrong. They followed policy.”
Authorities held the two men for about nine hours, then released them because of “lack of evidence that a crime was committed,” according to a spokesman for the Philadelphia district attorney’s office.
The Washington Post reported that a Starbucks official said the company does not have a uniform policy for all stores on when to ask people to leave the store — these decisions are left to store managers. The manager who called the police no longer works for Starbucks, the company said. 
After the incident, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson spent some days in Philadelphia “learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it.” Johnson said there are situations in which a call to police is warranted, but that such a call “was completely inappropriate” in this case. Johnson met with the two men in private on Monday and personally apologized to them, according to a company spokeswoman, Jamie Riley. Johnson said, “Closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities.” 
Starbucks said it would develop the “racial-bias education” training with outside help, including from Bryan Stevenson, executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative; Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund; former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a public policy organization; and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League.
After meeting with Starbucks executives on Monday, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the company would “cooperate fully with our probes of the matter, particularly the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations’ review of Starbucks’ policies.”
There were demonstrations at the Philadelphia store on Monday and it was temporarily closed. It reopened Tuesday morning.

31353,2018-04-17,"China imposes 178.6 percent deposit on US sorghum imports, reduces automaker requirements","On Tuesday, China announced a temporary 178.6 percent deposit for Chinese importers to pay on purchases of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and to make alcohol. The deposit, scheduled to take effect Wednesday, is part of a preliminary decision to implement so-called anti-dumping tariffs on sorghum, and would cover some of the costs of the potential tariffs if they’re implemented. The deposit could discourage Chinese import of U.S. sorghum, The Washington Post reported.

Also on Tuesday, China said it would phase out its rule prohibiting foreign automakers from owning more than a 50 percent share in companies making vehicles for sale in the country.
China began an investigation on Feb. 4 into sorghum imports from the U.S. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the volume of U.S. sorghum exports to China was 15 times greater in 2017 than 2013, increasing from 317,000 tons to 4.76 million tons, and the price decreased by 31 percent during that time. The ministry’s preliminary ruling said the prices were improperly low, according to CBS News. Wang Hejun, director of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s trade remedy and investigation bureau, said the temporary deposit “aims at correcting unfair trade practices.”
An anti-dumping tariff or duty is applied to a product that a country believes is priced below fair market value and is designed to counter so-called “dumping” of that product, according to Investopedia. “Dumping” refers to when companies export a product at a lower price than is normally charged in that market in order to eliminate competitors in the foreign market, Investopedia reports.
According to Index Mundi, over the past ten years, sorghum prices reached a low of $130.98 per metric ton in June 2010 and a high of $302.53 in Aug. 2011. In March 2018, the price per metric ton was $181.10.
Kansas, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma and South Dakota are the five states that produce the most sorghum in the U.S. 
Change to automaker requirements
Tuesday’s announcement included phased changes to a 1994 requirement for automakers. The 1994 rule prohibited foreign automakers from holding more than a 50 percent share in a joint ventures with local companies that make cars for sale in China. The country said it would phase out the types of vehicles subject to the requirement, removing it from: electric cars and plug-in hybrids in 2018, commercial vehicles in 2020, and consumer passenger vehicles in 2022. China currently imposes a 25 percent tariff on imports of some U.S.-made vehicles.
China’s National Development and Reform Commission also said it would remove foreign ownership limits for shipbuilding and aircraft in 2018, Reuters reported.
ZTE ruling this week 
On Monday, the U.S. prohibited American companies from selling to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp, for seven years. The action was part of a determination by the U.S. Commerce Department that ZTE violated a civil and criminal penalty agreement with the U.S. for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, making false statements and obstructing justice. ZTE agreed to dismiss four employees and discipline 35 more through bonus reductions or reprimands. ZTE also agreed to pay $890 million in fines and penalties and to pay another $300 million if it violated the agreement. In March, ZTE said it had fired the four employees and had not disciplined the 35 others. 
In its announcement of the action against ZTE, the U.S. Commerce Department said, “This is a regulatory action and is unrelated to any ongoing trade-related actions.”
About 25 to 30 percent of ZTE’s equipment, including phones and telecommunications networks, comes from the U.S., according to Reuters. ZTE has sold phones to U.S. mobile service providers AT China was not exempted.
In March, China announced about $3 billion of tariffs on imports of 128 U.S. goods. In April, the U.S. proposed about $50 billion in potential tariffs on 1,300 categories of Chinese imports.

31349,2018-04-17,US Supreme Court rules immigration act provision is ‘unconstitutionally vague’,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Tuesday that a  provision of a federal law mandating deportation of immigrants convicted of an “aggravated felony” was unconstitutionally vague. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defined an “aggravated felony” as a “crime of violence” that carries a prison term of at least one year. A “crime of violence” is defined as one that involves a “substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense,” according to the Supreme Court ruling. 
The case before the court was Sessions v. Dimaya, which involved Philippine-born James Garcia Dimaya, who came to the U.S. in 1992 when he was 13. In 2007 and 2009, while a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., he had pleaded “no contest” to charges of residential burglary in California. A plea of “no contest” is often used in a plea bargain, and though technically not an admission of guilt, judges treat it as a guilty plea. In 2010, the U.S. government brought removal proceedings against him, calling the crime he was convicted of an “aggravated felony” under the INA. An immigration judge ruled he could be removed from the U.S. on this basis. 
Dimaya’s lawyers appealed and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in his favor that a provision of the INA was unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, which says no person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The ruling followed one in 2015 in the Supreme Court, when former Justice Antonin Scalia had written the majority opinion that a provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act was “unconstitutionally vague.”
The U.S., led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appealed the Dimaya case to the Supreme Court, where it first ended in a 4-4 tie in January 2017 after Justice Scalia’s death and prior to Justice Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the court. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s ruling. Justice Gorsuch and Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan and Sotomayor voted in favor of the ruling; Justices Alito, Kennedy, Roberts and Thomas voted against it.

31283,2018-04-17,Former Japanese PM calls for Abe to step down,"Former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that it would be a “good time” for current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to step down at the end of the current parliamentary session on June 20. “When the current Diet term ends, that would be a good time for Abe to resign. No third term for him as the party president,” said Koizumi, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006. He said in a magazine interview that Abe could harm his party’s chances at re-election. Abe has not announced any plans to resign. 

Abe’s approval rating is at 26.7 percent, according to a poll by the Nippon News Network, which is the lowest his rating has been. Some polls show Abe’s approval in the 30s. Over the weekend, as many as 50,000 people protested outside of Japan’s Diet, or parliament, calling on Abe to resign, according to the protest organizers. 
Media reports have alleged Abe might have exerted improper influence to give two educational institutes preferential treatment. In one case, a friend of Abe’s, Kotaro Kake, received government approval to open a new veterinary school called Kake Gakuen in a government-designated deregulation zone. It was the first approval to open a veterinary school in about 50 years. 
In the other case, educational group Moritomo Gakuen purchased land from the government in 2016 for a school at a rate deemed below market value. The Finance Ministry reportedly sold the land at 86 percent below its value. The ministry said last month that an internal investigation determined bureaucrats had redacted documents about the sale to remove Abe’s name before sending them to the parliament. Abe’s wife Akie was once named an honorary principal at Moritomo Gakuen. 
Abe has denied wrongdoing, and said officials acted independently. He said he would resign if there was proof either he or his wife were involved in wrongdoing. Neither media reports nor investigations have presented direct evidence that Abe has improperly exerted influence.  
Abe’s re-election
In September of last year, Abe dissolved the parliament and called for an early election, saying he wanted an election to be a “mandate from the people” on his domestic and foreign policies. The following month, his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner Komeito won a combined 312 of the 465 seats in the country’s lower house, enough for a supermajority. Prior to the election, Abe said he would resign if the LDP did not win a majority. 
Last year, the LDP changed its rules to allow a member to seek a third term as party leader. The next vote for party leader is in September. In Japan, the leader of the party with the most seats in parliament becomes the prime minister.  
Abe is scheduled to meet President Donald Trump on Tuesday at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

31280,2018-04-17,Accountability office says EPA violated appropriations act,"On Monday, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) violated appropriations legislation when it installed a soundproof booth without “necessary notification.” The GAO wrote in a letter to House and Senate lawmakers that it had concluded the EPA had violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2017. The alleged violation occurred when the agency failed to make the “necessary notification” before spending $43,238.68 to install the privacy booth in the EPA Administrator’s office. 
Section 710 of the Act says no funds in excess of $5,000 are to be spent to “purchase furniture or make improvements” in the office without notifying the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
The EPA said the booth was not part of a redecoration and should not be subject to Section 710 of the Act. In December, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the booth was “necessary” to be able to do his job. 
The letter states that the GAO recognizes “the requirement to protect classified material and the need for employees to have access to a secure telephone line when handling such information in the course of conducting official agency business” and explicitly draws no conclusions about “whether the installation of the privacy booth was the only, or the best, way for EPA to provide a secure telephone line for the Administrator.” 
EPA spokesman Liz Bowman said the agency was “addressing GAO’s concern” and “will be sending Congress the necessary information this week.”

31277,2018-04-17,Myanmar says refugee family repatriated; UN doesn’t confirm,"The Myanmar government said in a statement on Saturday that a family of five “Muslim” refugees returned to Myanmar through a “repatriation camp,” where they received supplies and national verification ID cards. The refugees are a Rohingya family, part of a minority group that does not hold citizenship and is not officially recognized by the Myanmar government. This is the first report of repatriation since approximately 700,000 Rohingya left Myanmar for Bangladesh beginning in August of last year. 
The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said in a statement Sunday that it was not consulted or involved with the family’s return and had no direct knowledge of the event. Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, Abul Kalam, said the family had “never entered the Bangladesh territory” and had been living in the “no-man's land camp, on the Myanmar side.” He said, “by definition, this is not an official repatriation.""
Last November, Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a memorandum agreeing to the return of Rohingya Muslim refugees to Myanmar. The Rohingya began leaving Myanmar last August after Myanmar soldiers engaged in what the government called “clearance operations.” The operations followed an attack by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army group (ARSA) that killed 12 people at a Myanmar police post. Some Rohingya said soldiers burned houses, stole possessions and opened fire on civilians. Myanmar’s military denies these allegations.
The U.N. and the U.S. have accused Myanmar of “ethnic cleansing,” which a U.N. commission defined as “a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.” Myanmar denies engaging in such an action.

31404,2018-04-18,More details reported after incident on Southwest Airlines flight kills one,"A fatal incident on a Southwest Airlines flight killed a woman on Tuesday, after the left engine of a Boeing 737-700 aircraft failed and pieces of it struck the plane, breaking one window. The cabin lost pressure and a woman was sucked out of the plane to her waist. Though people on board pulled her back in by her legs, she was later pronounced dead. Seven other passengers were treated for minor injuries, Philadelphia fire officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident.
Details of the incident
Southwest flight 1380 was headed from New York’s LaGuardia Airport to Dallas, with 144 passengers and five crew onboard. The plane’s left engine made a noise that passengers described as sounding like an explosion, about 20 minutes after takeoff. A window behind the left wing broke, and photographs of the plane after it landed showed it was missing.
After the window broke, the cabin lost pressure and oxygen masks dropped from the aircraft’s ceiling. Passenger Jennifer Riordan of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was sucked out the window up to her waist; her head and arms were out of the plane. Some men on the plane pulled her back in and two passengers performed CPR on her for 20 minutes. She was later pronounced dead. Riordan was a vice president of community relations for Wells Fargo  it can lead to the creation of small cracks. Sumwalt said the information was preliminary.
Sumwalt also said a covering for the engine was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. The engine was a CFM56-7B, which, according to NBC Philadelphia, is designed to prevent any debris that may accidentally break off from traveling into the plane’s body. The jet engine supplier CFM issued a service bulletin last fall for airlines to inspect the fan blades of this engine after a “similar incident” occurred on another Southwest flight, NBC Philadelphia reported. Officials had checked the plane’s engines on Sunday. 
Company responses 
Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said, “I am immensely grateful there are no other reports of injuries but truly this is a tragic loss.” He thanked the crew for its actions. Kelly told the NTSB that the company would start additional inspections of its planes’ engines, including through the use of ultrasound to detect possible fatigue, according to Sumwalt. 
Riordan’s death was the first onboard a Southwest flight in the company’s 51 year history. The death was the first on a U.S. passenger airline in more than nine years, according to Bloomberg.
CFM International, Inc. is a joint venture between General Electric Co. and French company Safran SA. CFM engines are used on more than 6,700 aircraft and have more than 350 million flight hours on them, according to CFM. The company said the engine has “an outstanding safety and reliability record” since it first came out in 1997.

31400,2018-04-18,3 Sandy Hook parents file defamation lawsuits against Alex Jones,"On Monday, three parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting filed two defamation lawsuits against Alex Jones, a radio host and owner of the Infowars website. Jones has suggested that parents of Sandy Hook shooting victims were actors, and has said media coverage of some mass shootings was “totally staged.” After the lawsuits were announced, he said the “contexts of the suits” were not accurate and that his lawyers were confident they would be dismissed. 
The lawsuits were filed in Travis County, Texas, where Jones resides and has an Infowars studio.
Neil Heslin brought one of the lawsuits; his six-year-old son Jesse died in the Sandy Hook attack. Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa brought another; their six-year-old son Noah died in the attack. Mark Bankston, a Houston lawyer, is representing them. 
Bankston is also representing a 24-year-old man in another case in which Infowars allegedly said the man was the perpatrator in the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17. A 19-year-old man, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged with the Parkland shooting.
The lawsuits by the Sandy Hook parents are seeking $1 million in damages from Jones, Infowars, and affiliated Free Speech Systems LLC. One of the lawsuits said the Infowars statements were “a continuation and elaboration of a years-long campaign to falsely attack the honesty of the Sandy Hook parents, casting them as participants in a ghastly conspiracy and cover-up.” One of the lawsuits said the “defendants’ defamatory statements were knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth.”
On Dec. 14, 2012, a single shooter killed 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut.
Jones’ broadcasts and the lawsuit claims
According to one of the lawsuits, in September 2014, Infowars published an article with the headline “FBI SAYS NO ONE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK.” It also says in December 2014, Jones said on his radio show, “The whole thing is a giant hoax. How do you deal with a total hoax? It took me about a year, with Sandy Hook, to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake.” When asked by NBC News’ Megyn Kelly in June 2017 about his “giant hoax” comment, Jones said he sometimes plays “devil’s advocate.”
In November 2016, Jones aired a segment called “Alex Jones Final Statement on Sandy Hook.” In April 2017, Jones aired a segment called “Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed.” 
In the 2016 video, Jones said, “I don’t know what really happened.” He said the “official story” of the event has “holes in it.” He added that he questioned the “PR and talking points” around the incident. During a broadcast, Jones has said that opponents of the Second Amendment could be involved in the “giant hoax” of Sandy Hook, according to The New York Times.
In a June 2017 news segment about Jones, Heslin told NBC News’ Megyn Kelly, “I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head.” Owen Shroyer, a reporter at Infowars who is named in one of the lawsuits, said after Heslin’s interview that Heslin could not have held his son because Sandy Hook parents identified their children after the shooting through photographs. Heslin’s lawsuit says Shroyer’s claim is false and that children’s bodies were given to their parents for their funerals.
Pozner and De La Rosa’s lawsuit refers to Jones talking about an interview that CNN’s Anderson Cooper did with De La Rosa after the shooting. In 2014, Jones referred to a moment in which Cooper turns his head and his nose seems to disappear; Jones called it proof that he was talking in front of a screen and wasn’t actually at the town square in Newtown, Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting occurred. The Times reported that this was a “compression artifact,” which is a “distortion that is common in video encoding.”
Jones’ response
In a broadcast in response to the lawsuit, Jones said, “I believe Sandy Hook happened,” and later, “I believe kids died there. I’m sorry for your loss.” He talked about a “police stand down” and that the media response was “totally staged” in multiple mass shootings. 
Jones said more than 10 lawsuits had been filed against him in the “last few months” by “Democratic Party-connected firms.” He said his lawyers were “very confident” these suits were “frivolous,” that what was put in the “contexts of the suits” was “not accurate” and that they would be dismissed. 
Related cases
In June 2017, a judge sentenced Infowars viewer Lucy Richards to five months in prison for leaving messages for Pozner that included telling him, “you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon.” Richard’s sentence specified that she was no longer allowed to access Infowars.
In March, a Virginia man named Brennan Gilmore sued Jones for saying Gilmore was a “deep state shill” and a “CIA asset.” Gilmore recorded and posted online a video of a car that drove into a crowd, killing at least one, in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year during a “Unite the Right” rally. Jones said none of the InfoWars coverage of Gilmore was knowingly false.

31492,2018-04-19,"No criminal charges in Prince’s death, prosecutors say","On Thursday, prosecutors said they would not file criminal charges involving the death of the musician Prince. The artist, whose full name was Prince Rogers Nelson, was found dead on April 21, 2016, in Paisley Park, his home in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was 57 years old. Mark Metz, a prosecutor for the Minnesota Carver County attorney’s office, said Prince died from an overdose of fentanyl, which was present in counterfeit Vicodin pills he took. 
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin, and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to Metz. Vicodin is a pain-relieving drug that combines acetaminophen and the opioid hydrocodone. 
Metz said Prince had no known Vicodin or fentanyl prescriptions. He said there was no evidence to suggest Prince knowingly ingested fentanyl and that law enforcement was unable to determine the source of the counterfeit pills. Metz also said there was no evidence to suggest any “sinister motive, intent or conspiracy to murder Prince.”

31487,2018-04-19,"Michael Cohen withdraws lawsuits against BuzzFeed, Fusion GPS over Steele dossier","On Wednesday, lawyers for Michael Cohen, one of President Donald Trump’s attorneys, withdrew a defamation lawsuit against media company BuzzFeed and political research firm Fusion GPS over a dossier BuzzFeed published last year. Cohen’s attorney, David Schwartz, said that “given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.” 
Last week, the FBI raided Cohen’s office and hotel room. Last Friday, the Justice Department said Cohen is under “criminal investigation” regarding his business dealings.
Schwartz said, “The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one. We believe the defendants defamed my client, and vindicating Mr. Cohen’s rights was — and still remains — important.” 
The dossier, prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele while working for Fusion GPS, alleged that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election in coordination with Trump’s campaign. The dossier also claimed that Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague during the 2016 campaign, which Cohen denies.
In January, Cohen filed a lawsuit against Fusion GPS in a federal court, and a lawsuit against Buzzfeed and four of its employees in a New York state court. The suits said the dossier contained “false and defamatory” information that caused “harm to [Cohen’s] personal and professional reputation, current business interests and the impairment of business opportunities.” Fusion GPS called Cohen’s suit against the company a “meritless complaint.”
When Buzzfeed published the dossier in January of last year, it said, “The allegations are unverified, and the report contains errors.” Buzzfeed said it published the dossier because it was “an important part of the government’s investigation into potential collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Its interest to the public is, and always has been, obvious.”
The owners of a Russian bank have also filed a lawsuit against Buzzfeed for publishing the dossier.

31464,2018-04-19,Russia asks WTO for consultation with US over new tariffs,"Russia on Thursday requested “consultations” with the U.S. through the World Trade Organization (WTO) about the U.S.’ decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The tariffs, which took effect March 23, include a 25 percent tariff on steel products and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum products. India, China and the EU have also petitioned the WTO for a similar tariff consultation with the U.S.
According to the WTO, “consultations” allow member states to discuss a complaint and “find a satisfactory solution without proceeding further with litigation.” In their filings, Russia and the other countries said the U.S. tariffs are a “safeguard” measure and that the U.S. should compensate steel and aluminum exporters, as per WTO rules. The U.S. says the tariffs are not “safeguard measures,” AP reported, and President Donald Trump has said they are a “matter of necessity” for U.S. security.
The WTO’s “safeguard measure” rules stipulate that the importer’s tariffs must be temporary, they may be imposed only when imports are “found to cause or threaten serious injury to a competing domestic industry,” and that the importer must compensate any WTO members whose trade is adversely affected.
On Wednesday, the WTO said the U.S. told India and the EU that it was open to consultations if they are not about “safeguards.”
China’s filing to the WTO also included a “dispute” claim against the U.S. China said the tariffs are “inconsistent with provisions of the WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and of the Agreement on Safeguards.”
If consultations have not resolved the dispute after 60 days, “the complainant may request adjudication by a panel,” according to the WTO.

31440,2018-04-19,Trump confirms that CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un,"President Donald Trump confirmed on Wednesday that CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in preparation for a planned meeting between Trump and Kim. Trump’s confirmation followed news reports about the meeting on Tuesday. The president nominated Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, after Tillerson’s resignation was announced last month. Pompeo is currently participating in confirmation hearings with a senate committee.
“Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. On Tuesday, The Washington Post first reported the meeting took place, saying it occurred over Easter weekend, March 31 to April 1. White House officials confirmed on Wednesday that Pompeo met with Kim over the Easter weekend, AP reported.
In Trump’s tweet about Pompeo in North Korea, he said, “Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!” Trump tweeted while in Florida meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The White House said Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong Un would likely happen in the second half of May or first half of June, somewhere in Europe or Asia. On Tuesday, Trump said, “it’s possible things won’t go well and we won’t have the meetings.” Trump would be the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a leader of North Korea since the Korean War. 
Pompeo’s meeting with Kim was the highest level meeting between a North Korean leader and an American official since 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong-Il, who was Kim Jong Un’s father.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Wednesday that China hopes the U.S. and North Korea will work towards a political resolution to the situation between North and South Korea, who are technically still at war after a cease-fire marked the end of fighting in the Korean War of 1950 to 1953. North Korea is also currently under U.N. sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile test programs.
Kim is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the demilitarized zone between the two countries on April 27.
Pompeo’s secretary of state confirmation hearings
During a confirmation hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, Pompeo said meetings with North Korea could lead to a possible comprehensive agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
“I’m optimistic that the United States government can set the conditions for that appropriately so that the president and the North Korean leader can have that conversation and will set us down the course of achieving a diplomatic outcome that America and the world so desperately need,” Pompeo said. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will be the first to vote on Pompeo’s nomination for secretary of state. Republicans have an 11-10 majority on the committee. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said he will vote against Pompeo’s confirmation. If the committee does not vote in Pompeo’s favor, his nomination could be sent to the full Senate with a recommendation from the committee against confirmation.
Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the full Senate, though Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is away from the senate for health reasons, leaving Republicans with 50 to 49 seats. If Paul votes against Pompeo, at least one Democrat would have to vote yes to confirm him in a vote of the full Senate. 
When Pompeo was confirmed as director of the CIA in January of last year, 14 Democrats voted in his favor. At least three of those Democrats, Sens. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and Tim Kaine (Va.), said they would not vote for him for the position of secretary of state. 
On Wednesday, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said he expects a full Senate vote on Pompeo could happen next week.

Tens of thousands of PREPA’s customers have been without power on an ongoing basis since Hurricane Maria in September of last year.
Lionel Orama, an electrical engineer and professor at the University of Puerto Rico, said the transmission line that was downed was a “huge” one that connects two main power plants in the south of the island.
By 3:30 p.m. local time, power had been restored to at least seven municipalities and five hospitals, according to CNN. PREPA said it was prioritizing bringing back power to hospitals, the San Juan airport, water pump systems and financial institutions.
Last week, about 870,000 customers lost power, about half of PREPA’s total customers, when the same contractor knocked over a tree while clearing vegetation.
After Hurricane Maria passed over Puerto Rico in September of last year, at least 95 percent of the island was without power. The blackout after Hurricane Maria was the second largest in recorded history; a 2013 power outage caused by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines was the largest.
Puerto Rico has a population of about 3 million people.

31433,2018-04-19,Cuban assembly nominates Miguel Díaz-Canel as next president after Raúl Castro,"On Wednesday, the Cuban National Assembly nominated Miguel Díaz-Canel to be the next president of Cuba after Raúl Castro resigns from the position on Thursday, April 19. Raúl, 86, is the younger brother of Fidel Castro, who left office after an illness in 2006, formally resigned in 2008 and died in 2016. Díaz-Canel, 57, was appointed First Vice President of Cuba’s Council of State in 2013. The assembly must still vote him into office. 
Díaz-Canel is an electrical engineer who has taught at a university. He served as the First Secretary of the Young Communist League of Cuba. When asked recently about Cuba’s future, he said, “I believe in continuity.” Raúl Castro said Díaz-Canel has “ideological firmness.” 
The 605 members of the National Assembly were elected last month; all of them ran unopposed and they are scheduled to be sworn in this month. The assembly votes on the members of the Council of State, whose president serves as president of the government.
Fidel Castro took power after the Cuban revolution in 1959. Cuban government officials said Raúl Castro plans to move to Santiago de Cuba, where his brother is buried, and may have the final say in some government decisions, CNN reported. Raúl will remain the first secretary of the Cuban communist party and a member of the National Assembly.

31429,2018-04-19,Turkish President Erdoğan calls for early elections,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called on Wednesday for early elections to be held on June 24 of this year. Changes to presidential powers are scheduled to take effect after the next election, originally planned for November 2019, in accordance with a referendum last year. Erdoğan cited the situation in Syria, where Turkey is fighting a Kurdish group, as a factor in the decision to call early elections. 
“Switching to a new system of government has increasingly gained urgency so that decisions regarding our country’s future can be made and implemented with greater strength,” Erdoğan said in announcing the decision. He added that “the cross-border operations in Syria” and “incidents of historic importance centered in Syria and Iraq” have “made it imperative for Turkey to overcome uncertainties quickly.”
Turkish forces have been fighting the Kurdish YPG group in northwestern Syria. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group with ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has fought for autonomy in southeastern Turkey. The YPG has denied direct links with PKK.
Erdoğan said he decided to call early elections after talking to the head of the MHP party, Devlet Bahceli. This year, Erdoğan’s AK party formed an election alliance with the MHP party, according to The Washington Post.
Turkish governmental powers 
In April of last year, Turkey passed a referendum on constitutional changes in a 51.4 percent vote. The changes, which are scheduled to be implemented after the next presidential election, include eliminating the position of prime minister, allowing the president to appoint ministers without parliamentary approval and increasing the numbers of senior judges chosen by the president.  
The referendum vote was held almost a year after a failed coup attempt to overthrow Erdoğan’s government in July 2016. After the coup attempt, which led to 241 deaths, Turkey implemented a state of emergency. Turkey’s parliament is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on whether to extend the state of emergency again, after six previous extensions.
A U.N. report last month said there had been human rights violations in Turkey under the state of emergency, including arbitrary detentions and torture. There have been some sit-in protests in Turkey this week against extending the state of emergency.

31604,2018-04-20,"North Korea suspends nuclear weapons and missile testing, state media reports","North Korea said it would suspend its nuclear weapons and long-range missile testing as of Saturday, state media reported on Friday. State-run media outlet Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the decision was made so the North could focus on creating the “optimal international environment” to build its economy.
The decision was reportedly made at a full meeting of the Korean Workers’ Party Central Committee. “To secure transparency on the suspension of nuclear tests, we will close the republic’s northern nuclear test site,” the party’s resolution said.
“Nuclear development has proceeded scientifically and in due order and the development of the delivery strike means also proceeded scientifically and verified the completion of nuclear weapons. … We no longer need any nuclear test or test launches of intermediate and intercontinental range ballistic missiles and because of this the northern nuclear test site has finished its mission,” leader Kim Jong Un is reported as saying on KCNA.
Kim is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on April 29. Kim also plans to meet with President Donald Trump in May or June.
A White House official told CNN that Trump is aware of the development, and that the administration would assess the situation before commenting.

31598,2018-04-20,US students protest gun violence on anniversary of Columbine shooting,"Students from schools across the U.S. participated in walkouts protesting gun violence on Friday, the anniversary of the Columbine mass shooting. More than 2,500 schools were estimated to participate, according to organizers of the National School Walkout. 
 
 Lane Murdock, a sophomore high school student from Ridgefield High School in Connecticut, organized the protests. Murdock said she organized the demonstration in response to the Parkland shooting, in which a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14 of this year. 
Students in the walkouts are “protesting congressional, state, and local failures to take action to prevent gun violence,” according to the organizers’ website. The National School Walkout has three stated goals: to hold elected officials “accountable,” to “promote solutions to gun violence,” and to “demystify and engage students in the political system.” The group’s website does not issue specific legislative demands. 
The walkouts include a 19-minute silence, one minute to symbolize each year since the Columbine mass shooting. In that shooting, which occurred in Colorado on April 20, 1999, two teenagers killed 12 students and one teacher, and injured 24 others, before killing themselves. 
The walkouts were smaller in size than the March 24 “March for Our Lives” protests organized by Parkland students, according to The Washington Post. The Post reported that some school districts were supporting the student walkouts and others, such as Arlington County, would treat students leaving without parental permission as an unexcused absence.  
An average of ten shootings per year at U.S. schools have occurred since 1999, according to a report by The Washington Post, including targeted shootings, gang violence and mass shootings. The report found at least 130 students, teachers, staff and family members have been killed on school campuses during school hours in that time. 
In 2017, more than 15,600 people were killed in U.S. shooting incidents, according to non-profit tracking organization Gun Violence Archive. The U.S. has a total population of approximately 325.7 million people.

31579,2018-04-20,The facts on James Comey’s memos,"Comey memos on Trump conversations released
Memos written by FBI Director James Comey outlining his interactions with President Donald Trump were released to Congress on Thursday evening, and published in media reports. The memos, partially redacted, describe four in person conversations and three phone calls that took place between Comey and Trump between Jan. 7, 2017 and April 11, 2017. After the release of the memos, the president tweeted that they showed there was no collusion or obstruction of justice, and later tweeted that Comey had lied.
Some of the interactions Comey described in the 15 pages of memos were previously publicly discussed in his testimony before Congress last June. Last May, The New York Times reported that Comey had written a memo about a Feb. 14, 2017 conversation in which Trump allegedly said he hoped Comey could “let this go,” referring to former national security advisor Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn. 
The memo released Thursday gives the same account. Trump reportedly told Comey that Flynn was a “good guy” who had “been through a lot,” adding that the president fired him because he misled Vice President Mike Pence. “I replied by saying, ‘I agree he is a good guy,’ but said no more,” Comey wrote in the memo.
Flynn later pleaded guilty last December to lying to the FBI, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
After the Times’ report on the memo last year, the White House released a statement saying media reports of the memo were “not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.” 
The newly released memos also cite another conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn. At a Jan. 28, 2017 meeting, Trump allegedly said Flynn had “serious judgment issues.” According to a memo dated Feb. 8, 2017, then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reportedly asked Comey if there was a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) order on Flynn. (For more on the act, read here). 
In another newly released memo, Comey describes a dinner with Trump in which the president allegedly said, “I need loyalty.” Comey replied that he would get honesty, according to his memo, to which Trump reportedly said he wanted “honest loyalty.” Comey said he responded, “you will get that from me.” He wrote that he chose to understand the meaning of that to be serving the president with “loyalty to the office, the country and the truth.”
Some of the memos were addressed to then FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, then FBI chief of staff James Rybicki, and then General Counsel to the FBI James Baker. All three have since either resigned or been fired from the FBI. Comey was dismissed from the FBI on May 9, 2017.
The release
The Justice Department sent the redacted version of the memos to Congress on Thursday, after a request from three Republican House chairmen last week. The request was made by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). 
Goodlatte, Dowdy and Nunes said in a statement that Comey showed political bias by having “at least two different standards in his interactions with others,” referring to his decision not to document interactions with former President Barack Obama. 
The Justice Department said the unredacted, still classified versions would be made available to Congress for secure viewing on Friday. 
Trump’s response
On Thursday night, Trump tweeted in response to the memos’ release, “James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?” 
On Friday morning, he tweeted, “So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey (sic) James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so!”

31502,2018-04-20,Senate confirms Jim Bridenstine as NASA administrator,"On Thursday, the U.S. Senate confirmed Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) administrator, seven and a half months after his initial nomination to the role by President Donald Trump. Bridenstine, a former Navy pilot, will be the first elected official to be appointed head of the space agency. Fifty Republicans voted for Bridenstine’s confirmation and 47 Democrats and two independents voted against it. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was not present for the vote due to health issues.
NASA has a budget of about $20 billion and more than 18,000 employees. It performs space missions, including supporting the international space station, and also conducts research on climate change.
On the subject of climate change, Bridenstine said in 2013 that global temperatures had “stopped rising 10 years ago.” During his confirmation hearing in November of last year, he said human activity “absolutely” contributed to climate change. He also said he wants to “make sure that NASA remains … apolitical.”
Bridenstine was elected to Congress in 2012 and has been a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee. Before joining Congress, he served as Executive Director of the Tulsa Air and Space Museum  Planetarium. Bridenstine is not a scientist or a retired astronaut. Some past NASA administrators have not been scientists or retired astronauts, according to Breitbart.
In 2016, Bridenstine sponsored the American Space Renaissance Act, a bill that was not voted on. The act would have included directing NASA to come up with a 20-year plan outlining “broad goals” for the agency over that time period. 
Trump nominated Bridenstine on Sept. 5 of last year. The previous NASA administrator, Charles F. Bolden, Jr., resigned when Trump became president, on Jan. 20, 2017. Robert Lightfoot Jr. then became acting administrator. Lightfoot announced last month that he would retire at the end of April. Once Bridenstine is sworn in, he will become the 13th administrator in NASA’s history since its founding in 1958.
Trump has not nominated anyone for the position of NASA’s deputy administrator.

31505,2018-04-20,"Some engines to require inspection after Southwest failure, FAA says","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday it would require inspections of some CFM56-7B engines, like the one that failed on Tuesday’s Southwest Airlines flight, killing one passenger. Engines with more than a certain number of flights would require ultrasonic inspection of fan blades, and any blades that fail inspection would require replacement. Authorities said their preliminary investigation indicated a fan blade broke off during flight, as one had done on a 2016 Southwest flight that landed safely in Florida.
On Wednesday evening, the FAA tweeted that it “will issue an Airworthiness Directive (AD) within the next two weeks that will require inspections of certain CFM56-7B engines. The directive will require an ultrasonic inspection of fan blades when they reach a certain number of takeoffs and landings. Any blades that fail the inspection will have to be replaced.”
After the 2016 incident, the FAA recommended inspections of some CFM engines.
Based on its forthcoming requirement of having engines tested after a certain number of flights, the FAA estimated that 220 CFM56-7B engines would have been required to be tested last year. It did not say how many would require inspection this year.
Other airlines, including United, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said Wednesday they had begun inspections on some of the CFM56-78B engines used on their aircraft.
Tuesday’s accident involved pieces of the Southwest flight’s engine hitting and breaking a plane window. Jennifer Riordan, a mother of two, was partially drawn out of the window and died from blunt impact trauma to the head, neck and torso, Philadelphia’s medical examiner said Wednesday.
Investigators said Wednesday that for a few seconds after the engine failed, the aircraft rolled to an angle of 41 degrees, and then levelled out. The pilot, Tammy Jo Shults, was able to safely land the plane in Philadelphia and, other than Riordan, seven people aboard had minor injuries.

31508,2018-04-20,"North Korea shows ‘willingness’ to denuclearize without US troop withdrawal, Moon says","On Thursday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said North Korea had “expressed willingness” to give up its nuclear program without the condition of U.S. forces withdrawing from the Korean peninsula. Moon also said denuclearization based on troop withdrawal would be a “condition that the U.S. cannot accept.” Moon is scheduled to meet for peace talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on April 29 in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
President Donald Trump is planning to meet with Kim in late May or early June, according to the White House. He said Wednesday, “If we don't think it's going to be successful, we won't have it. If the meeting when I'm there isn't fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting."" He added, “I like always remaining flexible,” and, ""we'll remain flexible here.""

31615,2018-04-21,"DNC files lawsuit against Trump campaign officials, Russian government, WikiLeaks","On Friday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) filed a lawsuit against several Trump campaign officials, the Russian government and the media organization WikiLeaks. The suit alleges the defendants conspired in advance of the 2016 U.S. presidential election “to disseminate stolen DNC data to aid” then Republican candidate Donald Trump. The complaint alleges the defendants had a “common goal of damaging the Democratic party.”
The White House, the Russian Embassy and WikiLeaks did not comment on the suit, according to The Washington Post. Trump has previously denied coordinating with Russian officials. 
The complaint alleges that Russian intelligence services hacked the DNC’s computers and stole information and that Russia told the Trump campaign that its government “supported Trump and was prepared to use stolen emails and other information to damage” then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. 
The complaint also claims the Trump campaign “welcomed” Russia’s involvement, “solicited” Russia’s assistance and “maintained secret communications with individuals tied to the Russian government.” Russia then “strategically” disseminated the stolen information through WikiLeaks, the complaint alleges. 
The complaint names Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Roger Stone, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and others, including ten John Does. 
Foreign governments typically have immunity from U.S. lawsuits, according to Fox News. The complaint claims Russia is not entitled to sovereign immunity because the “DNC claims arise out of Russia’s trespass on to the DNC’s private servers.” 
The suit seeks compensation worth millions of dollars, according to The Washington Post. The DNC alleges the defendants’ actions:

	“undermined” the party’s ability to communicate with the American electorate
	resulted in fewer donations to the party
	cost the DNC more than one million dollars to address cyber-security
	exposed some DNC employees to harassment and death threats

The complaint was filed in federal district court in Manhattan on behalf of the Cohen-Milstein law firm. (The firm has no connection to Michael Cohen, one of Trump’s personal attorneys.)

31608,2018-04-21,Leaders name Prince Charles as the next head of the Commonwealth,"Charles, Prince of Wales, was named as the next leader of the Commonwealth at a summit on Friday, to take over from Queen Elizabeth II, leaders of the body announced. The Commonwealth is a body of 53 member states, mostly former British colonies, with a collective population of about 2.4 billion people. The leader’s role is non-hereditary, meaning it would not automatically be passed to the queen’s son Charles upon her death.
Leaders from the Commonwealth have been meeting at a two day summit at Windsor Castle, near London. The queen, who turns 92 on Saturday, has been the head since 1952, after her father’s death. During that time, the Commonwealth has increased from eight member states to 53. The role of head, which carries no maximum term, aims to unify the body and make sure its goals of international cooperation and trade are fulfilled, BBC reported. The head makes visits to member states to improve relations, according to the outlet.
In a Thursday speech at Buckingham Palace in London marking the opening of the summit, the queen said it was her “sincere wish” Charles would head the Commonwealth “one day.”
Commonwealth leaders announced other decisions at the summit, including a so-called “blue charter” to reduce pollution and a “cyber declaration” aimed at addressing online crime. The Commonwealth said in a statement, “we recognise the threat of climate change on the world but in particular the existential threat to Small Island Developing States.” U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said leaders also agreed to increase trade among member states to $2 trillion by 2030 to “fight protectionism.” 
The next summit is scheduled for 2020 in Rwanda.

31825,2018-04-23,US orders relatives of State Department personnel to leave Nicaragua amid protests,"The U.S. State Department ordered family members of government personnel to leave Nicaragua on Monday, in response to ongoing protests and looting that have killed at least 10 people. The department also authorized government personnel to evacuate on a case-by-case basis. Violent protests started last Wednesday in the capital city of Managua after President Daniel Ortega announced changes to the country’s pension system. Ortega announced in a televised address on Sunday evening that he would cancel the proposed reforms.  
The State Department said “political rallies and demonstrations are occurring daily, often with little notice or predictability,” adding that some “result in injuries and deaths.” It said looting, vandalism and arson have been occurring and that violent crimes including sexual assault and armed robbery are “common.” The department also said authorities have been using “tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and live ammunition against” protesters. 
Since last Wednesday when protests began, at least 10 people have been killed, including at least one journalist who was reporting on the protests, and at least one police officer. The government’s official count said 10 were killed, while Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa reported that more than 30 people have been killed. 
Last Wednesday, hundreds of protesters began demonstrations in Managua after the government approved changes to the pension system that would have gone into effect on July 1. BBC reported that a group of men wearing motorcycle helmets attacked some of the protesters and journalists using metal pipes and cables. Local media reported that some of the attackers wore T-shirts with pro-government slogans. 
Ongoing looting and protests have taken place in the capital and other Nicaraguan cities for five days. On Friday, Nicaragua deployed army personnel to defend government buildings. Some television stations have been taken off air, and have alleged they are being censored. 
“We must re-establish order, we will not allow chaos, crime and looting to reign,” the president said. The vice president said the government response to the riots is necessary as a “legitimate defense against a tiny group” of instigators. 
Social security reform
The proposed social security reforms included requiring employees to put 7 percent of their salaries towards social security, an increase from 6.25 percent, and 5 percent of their pension into a medical expenses fund, BBC reported. The changes would also reduce payouts by 5 percent, according to Al Jazeera. On Sunday night, Ortega said he would cancel the reforms that he said “acted as a trigger that started this whole situation.”

Ortega, 72, is in his third consecutive term since being re-elected in 2007, after serving as president in the 1980s. Earlier this year, his wife Rosario Murillo became vice president.

31776,2018-04-23,4 dead in shooting at Nashville Waffle House restaurant; suspect arrested,"A man opened fire in a Waffle House restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee on Sunday morning, killing four people and injuring two, according to police. The gunman was wearing a green jacket with nothing underneath when he began firing an AR-15 rifle at approximately 3:25 a.m. He shot and killed two people outside the restaurant before entering the restaurant and continuing to fire. On Monday, Nashville police announced the suspect, identified as Travis Reinking, 29, had been arrested.
According to witness James Shaw, Jr., who was in the restaurant, the shots first sounded like plates had fallen. Shaw said the glass behind him broke and he “jumped towards the bathroom.” He said the shooter entered the restaurant and “shot towards the bathroom.” The witness said the gun either jammed or the shooter tried to reload, and Shaw saw an opportunity, ran through the door and “started wrestling” for the gun. When the shooter let go of the gun with one hand, Shaw said he took the gun from the shooter and tossed it over the counter. Then Shaw said he “removed” the shooter from the restaurant and the man “kind of walked off by himself.”
The deceased include restaurant worker Taurean C. Sanderlin, 29, and restaurant customers Joe R. Perez, 20, Akilah Dasilva, 23, and Deebony Groves, 21. Two people wounded in the attack are being treated for gunshot wounds at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, according to a police spokesman. One is in critical condition and the other in critical but stable condition, according to a spokesperson for the medical center. 
The Metro Nashville Police Department had tweeted on Monday, “MNPD officers, to include SWAT, have continued the search for Travis Reinking in the Antioch area overnight. There have been no credible sightings. The search will continue. All schools in the area have been cleared by officers. He was last seen Sun morn behind his apt complex.”

31773,2018-04-23,"EU, Mexico announce ‘agreement in principle’ on free trade","On Saturday, the European Union and Mexico announced an “agreement in principle” to update a trade pact that went into effect in 2000. Among other things, the updated version would remove duties from some agricultural exports and change customs procedures between the EU and Mexico. Negotiators plan to finalize the full legal text by the end of the year, according to the European Commission. Before implementation, the agreement must be approved by the European Parliament and the Mexican Senate. 
According to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the agreement would join Mexico with Canada, Japan and Singapore among the partners “willing to work with the EU” and its system of trade. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the agreement may need “fine-tuning in the coming months.” 

The agreement calls for:

	Duty-free trade on some EU agricultural exports, including most pork products, chocolate and pasta, as well as some Mexican agricultural exports, including orange juice, tuna, honey, agave syrup, fruits and vegetables.
	Simplified customs procedures and paperwork.
	Intellectual property rights protection, including protection against imitations of 340 European food and drink products sold in Mexico.
	Implementing the climate change initiatives both parties committed to under the Paris Agreement. The EU-Mexico agreement also stipulates labor, safety, environmental and consumer protection standards.
	Enacting provisions against corruption, bribery and money laundering activities.
	Mutual access to government contracts for companies in the public procurement markets in the EU and Mexico.
	The removal of some online trade conditions between the EU and Mexico, such as customs duties charged for downloading certain apps.
	The creation of a Multilateral Investment Court to provide investment protection.

The EU and Mexico began negotiations for the new agreement in May 2016. Last year, Mexico exported €28.8 billion (approximately $35.4 billion) of goods and services to the EU, and the EU exported €37.9 billion (approximately $46.5 billion) to Mexico.

31921,2018-04-24,Italy’s High Court rejects request to release migrant rescue boat,"Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation rejected a request from non-governmental German group Jugend Rettet to release its migrant rescue ship. Prosecutors alleged the group cooperated with human smugglers, and requested a pre-emptive seizure of the boat, the Iuventa, in August 2017 to prevent the alleged crimes from continuing.
Prosecutors said that boat was seized because crew members had contact with human smugglers on three occasions. Jugend Rettet’s lawyer, Philipp Kulker, said the evidence used in the decision had been fabricated. The court plans to publish an explanatory statement in the coming weeks, Al Jazeera reported.
According to Al Jazeera, prosecutors have not filed official charges against any individuals allegedly involved in the Iuventa case. In Italy, aiding and abetting illegal migration can result in a five- to 15-year prison sentence, and a fine†breit of 15,000 euros (about $18,300) for each person who has been let into the country. 
Jugend Rettet (German for “youth rescue”) said Tuesday it would continue to “fight for the right to rescue people in danger at sea.”
According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), one in 14 people emigrating from Libya to Italy by boat this year have died, and one in 29 migrants died in the same period last year. Italy had 119,130 migrant arrivals in 2017, which is a decine from the previous year’s total of 181,436, according to Al Jazeera.
The Iuventa is being held in the port of Trapani in western Sicily.

31916,2018-04-24,Pompeo approved by Senate Foreign Relations Committee,"The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday to give Mike Pompeo a favorable recommendation to become Secretary of State, advancing his nomination to the full Senate. One Democrat and 10 Republicans voted in favor of Pompeo; nine Democrats voted against his nomination. The full senate may vote on Pompeo’s nomination later this week, The Guardian reported.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who had previously said he would vote against Pompeo’s confirmation, changed his vote to “yes” after receiving “assurances” from President Donald Trump and Pompeo himself that the nominee supported the president’s view that the Iraq War was “a mistake, and that it is time to leave Afghanistan.”
Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) had originally voted against the nomination, then changed his vote to advance the nomination after Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) was unable to submit his “yes” vote in person. A senator must be physically present to cast the deciding vote. If Coons didn’t change his vote, the tally would have been 10-10.
Pompeo has served as Trump’s CIA Director since January 2017. If confirmed by the Senate, Pompeo would replace Trump’s former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, who left the position last month.
Pompeo reportedly met with Kim Jong-un during a visit to Pyongyang earlier this month, the highest level meeting between a North Korean leader and an American official since 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong-Il, who was Kim Jong Un’s father. The White House said Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong Un would likely happen in the second half of May or first half of June, somewhere in Europe or Asia.

31913,2018-04-24,Senate VA Committee postpones Jackson’s confirmation hearing,"The Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has indefinitely postponed a confirmation hearing for U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson’s nomination as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The hearing had been scheduled for Wednesday.
According to AP, two aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity described “inappropriate behavior” by Jackson, who is currently the president’s medical doctor, and said he “over-prescribed” prescription drugs. 
In response to the allegations, chairman of the committee, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), and ranking committee Democrat, Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), said, “We will continue looking into these serious allegations and have requested additional information from the White House to enable the committee to conduct a full review.” The two senators sent a letter to President Donald Trump requesting all communications between the Pentagon and the White House over the last 12 years regarding “allegations or incidents” involving Jackson.
Jackson has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations against him. When asked for comment, Jackson said, “I’m looking forward to the hearing, so we can sit down and I can explain everything to everyone and answer all the senators’ questions.” 
On Tuesday, Trump repeated support for Jackson, adding he would “let it be [Jackson’s] choice” whether to continue with the confirmation process or withdraw from consideration.
Trump nominated Jackson last month to replace David Shulkin, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama. Jackson, 50, is a rear admiral in the Navy who graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch with a Doctor of Medicine in 1995. He has worked as a White House physician since 2006 and was appointed the personal physician of the president by President Obama in 2013.

31838,2018-04-24,"Man charged after allegedly driving van into pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 (Update)","A white van struck multiple pedestrians in Toronto, Canada, on Monday afternoon, killing ten people and injuring at least 13, police confirmed. The van reportedly traveled over the curb and hit pedestrians on the sidewalk, according to Constable Jenifferjit Sidhu. On Tuesday, Alek Minassian, 25, was charged with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder in connection with the incident. 
The police were called to Yonge Street and Finch Avenue West at approximately 1:30 p.m. local time, and took the driver into custody about 90 minutes later. 
The New York Times described video footage from bystanders showing a man standing beside a damaged white rental van being told repeatedly to “get down” by police. The man yelled, “kill me,” before being taken into custody.
Sidhu said on Monday the police do not know “the cause or reason for the collision.” Canada’s Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the events “do not appear to be connected in any way to national security based on the information available at this time,” adding that there’s not current information that would “indicate a change in the risk level” to security.
On Tuesday, police said the incident appeared to be intentional. Minassian appeared in court to hear the charges against him, and was ordered not to have any contact with the surviving people he allegedly hit. His next court date is scheduled for May 10.

31861,2018-04-24,Mexico’s presidential candidates take part in debate,"Mexico’s five presidential candidates participated in the first of three scheduled debates on Sunday. The candidates are: Andrés Manuel López Obrador, 64, of the MORENA party (National Regeneration Movement); Ricardo Anaya, 39, head of a coalition representing the National Action Party (PAN) and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD); José Antonio Meade, 49, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI); Margarita Zavala, 50, an independent; and Jaime Rodríguez, 60, an independent. The election is scheduled for July 1. 
Mexico’s current president Enrique Peña Nieto, of the PRI, is not eligible to run again, as the constitution limits presidents to one six-year term. 
According to an aggregate of polls on the site Oraculus.mx, López Obrador is leading opinion polls at 42.7 percent, Anaya is at 28.8 percent, Meade at 21 percent, Zavala at 4.9 percent and Rodriguez at 2.6 percent.
López Obrador is a former mayor of Mexico City and has twice before been runner up in presidential elections. During the debate, when asked about his plan to offer amnesty to criminals, he said, “amnesty does not mean impunity,” adding that “we have to attend to the original problems that led to the issue,” such as poverty. López Obrador formerly described a proposal to explore the possibility of amnesty for criminals.
Speaking about violence and government corruption, Anaya said “gangs should be dismantled, instead of just removing the leaders.” He also proposed an independent attorney general’s office to investigate government corruption.
Meade, a former finance minister, proposed a “specialized investigation agency” when dealing with crimes including kidnapping and trafficking.
Zavala, a former first lady, said that her government would focus on defending Mexicans from “the corrupt ones” and criminals. She said the “intervention of the state” has worked to address “safety.” Her husband is former President Felipe Calderón.
Rodríguez is the former governor of Nuevo León. He said, “thieves should have their hands chopped off.” He also raised the possibility of creating cyber police.
The two hour event on Sunday was televised. The second and third debates are scheduled for May 20 and June 12.

31834,2018-04-24,Armenian prime minister resigns after protests,"Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigned on Monday after taking office on April 17. He said he was fulfilling the “demands” of demonstrators who began calling for his resignation four days before he was sworn into the position. On Sunday, there were 50,000 protesters at a rally in the capital, Yerevan, according to AP. 
Sargsyan, 63, served as Armenia’s president for two terms, the maximum allowed in the constitution, from 2008 until April 9 of this year. In 2014, he said he would “not aspire” to hold the position of prime minister. 
In 2015, Armenia voted in a referendum to change its government from a presidential to a parliamentary system, with the prime minister role taking some of the powers the president role once held. 
On April 17 of this year, eight days after the end of Sargsyan’s presidency, parliament voted 76 to 17 with no abstentions to make him prime minister. At least 80 people were arrested during demonstrations on that day and the days prior, Radio Free Europe reported.
The protests were led by opposition leader Nikol Pashinian, AP reported. He said the prime minister “lacks legitimacy and has earned the hatred of Armenians.” On Sunday, Pashinian attended talks with Sargsyan and called for the prime minister to resign. The opposition leader was arrested after the meeting, and then released on Monday. 
When Sargsyan announced his decision, he said, “Nikol Pashinian was right,” adding that “the movement on the streets is against my rule” and he was “complying with their demands.” Pashinian said Sargsyan’s resignation was a “victory.”
The government of Armenia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, named former Prime Minister Karen Karapetian as acting prime minister. The opposition has asked to meet with him to discuss a “peaceful transfer of power.”

31973,2018-04-25,French President Emmanuel Macron addresses US Congress,"French President Emmanuel Macron addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, at the end of a three-day visit to the U.S. He spoke about the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris Agreement on climate change, “multilateralism,” the April joint airstrike on Syria, civil rights, digital privacy, “fake news,” and more. 
Iran deal
Speaking about the 2015 nuclear agreement, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for reduced economic sanctions, Macron said it “may not address all concerns and very important concerns. But we should not abandon it without having something substantial and more substantial instead.” He added, “Our objective is clear: Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons.” 
In October of last year, President Donald Trump had allowed a deadline to pass without recertifying Iran’s compliance with the deal. Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of new sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic missile program. Trump has set a deadline of May 12 to either renegotiate and “fix” the agreement or withdraw from it. 
Climate
Macron spoke about carbon emissions during his address, saying, “I am sure one day the U.S. will come back and join the Paris agreement.” He added, “We must find a smoother transition to a lower carbon economy.” 
Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement in June of last year. The accord called on nations to set voluntary goals to reduce carbon emissions with a stated goal of preventing the average global temperature from increasing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2º Celsius) above pre-industrial levels.
Nationalism in the New World Order
In his speech, Macron said, “The 21st century has brought a series of new threats and new challenges that our ancestors might not ever have imagined. Our strongest challenges are unknown New World Order.” 
“The international community needs to step up [its] game and build the 21st century world order based on the perennial principles we established together after World War II,” he said. “The rule of law, the fundamental values which we secured peace for 70 years are now questioned by urgent issues that require our joint action.” 
Macron said the world faces “inequalities created by globalization, threats to the planet, our common good, attacks on democracy … and the destabilization of our international community by new powers and criminal states.” 
He said that in response to the problems and “fear” of the 21st century, “we can choose isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism… but closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world.”
Macron said the U.S. “invented this multilateralism,” and it’s “the one now who has to help preserve and reinvent it,” and this would be “decisive for creating and safeguarding this free world.” He cited the recent joint strike by the U.S., Britain and France on alleged Syrian chemical weapons facilities as “evidence of multilateralism.”
Other topics
On the subject of digital privacy, Macron mentioned a “data protection” law passed by the EU and said he believed the U.S. and EU “should cooperate to find the right balance between innovation and ethics.”
Macron also said, “to protect our democracies, we have to fight against the ever growing virus of fake news which exposes our people to irrational fear and imaginary risk.”
“We have shared the history of civil rights,” Macron said of the U.S. and France, mentioning women’s rights and saying that “explains” why the #MeToo movement has a “deep resonance in France.”
Prior to Macron, seven French presidents have addressed a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, according to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Macron’s speech came on the anniversary of French President Charles de Gaulle’s address to a joint session of Congress in 1960.

31969,2018-04-25,Judge gives government 90 days to show DACA unlawful or accept new applications,"A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has 90 days to “better explain” its reason for declaring the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program unlawful. If DHS fails to do so, the court ruled that the government must begin accepting renewals and new applications for DACA work permits, which apply to certain people who were illegally brought into the U.S. as children.
 
 DACA work permit application processing for so-called “Dreamers” expired in March under a September 2017 directive from the Trump administration.
Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in his 60-page ruling that DHS discontinued DACA for “arbitrary and capricious” reasons and failed to “adequately explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.” Bates gave the government 90 days before implementing his ruling to allow DHS “an opportunity to better explain its rescission.”
The Justice Department said after the ruling that DACA was an “unlawful circumvention of Congress” and DHS “acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner.” Spokesman Devin O’Malley said the department “looks forward to vindicating its position in further litigation.”
A federal district court in California in January and another in New York in February ruled the government must accept DACA work permit renewals. In February, the Supreme Court declined to review the January injunction on the discontinuation of the DACA program before an appeals court does.
DACA is a program that provides work permits and protection from deportation for certain illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors prior to June 15, 2012.

The Republican campaign encouraged early voting, according to political consulting firm Calvary LLC, which worked on the campaign. The reported results included 154,000 early ballots.
Prior to the vote, Trump tweeted, “Arizona, please get out today and vote @DebbieLesko for Congress in #AZ08,” saying she was “strong” on the border, immigration and crime and “great” on the military.
Republicans hold 236 seats in the House, not including the Arizona seat in question, and Democrats hold 193.

32102,2018-04-26,Ronny Jackson withdraws as nominee for VA director,"White House Physician Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson withdrew himself from consideration for director of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) on Thursday. Earlier this week, a report made allegations of misconduct against Jackson, claiming he over-prescribed medications and had been in a car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol. Jackson said the allegations were “completely false and fabricated,” a “distraction” for President Donald Trump and veterans’ issues, and that he was “regretfully withdrawing” from the nomination.
The contents of the report were based on conversations with some of Jackson’s former and current colleagues, and have not been substantiated. In a statement, Jackson said if the allegations “had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over the past 12 years.” 
Trump announced last month that he was nominating Jackson to replace David Shulkin as VA director. Trump said Jackson “would have done a great job, he has a tremendous heart. These are false accusations, they are trying to destroy a man.""
The White House said Jackson will return to his work as a White House physician.

31995,2018-04-26,Democrats release report alleging misconduct by VA nominee Jackson,"Democratic staff of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs released a report on Wednesday alleging misconduct by Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trump’s personal physician and nominee to head the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA). The report outlines allegations that colleagues described Jackson as “abusive,” that he over-prescribed medications, prescribed medication to himself and had been in a car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol. Jackson has not responded to all the allegations, though he denied crashing a car. He said he looked forward to a hearing where he could answer senators’ questions.
The two-page report was prepared with the testimony of 23 unnamed current and former colleagues of Jackson’s, according to The New York Times. The allegations are currently unsubstantiated and committee members are investigating further, CNN reported.
One nurse said Jackson had written prescriptions to himself, and when this became known by others, asked a physician assistant to prescribe medications for him.
The report alleged that testimony indicated the White House Medical Unit (WHMU) where Jackson worked “had questionable record keeping for pharmaceuticals” and that Jackson would account for some medications after he had distributed them. White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short said reviews of the WHMU were conducted yearly, including reviews of prescriptions. Short said, “every year, they’ve said that he’s totally in compliance with what he’s been prescribing.”
The report also alleged that after a party, Jackson “wrecked a government vehicle” while intoxicated. Jackson said, “I have not wrecked a car. I can tell you that.” 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Wednesday that there had been at least four previous background investigations of Jackson while he was associated with the White House, including one by the FBI. She said, “None of those things have come up in the four separate background investigations that have taken place.” She also said, “Dr. Jackson’s record as a White House physician has been impeccable.”
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs indefinitely postponed Jackson’s hearing, originally scheduled for Wednesday.

31992,2018-04-26,"Police arrest alleged ‘Golden State Killer’ near Sacramento, California","Police have arrested Joseph James DeAngelo, a former police officer, on two counts of murder, according to the Sacramento district attorney’s office. DeAngelo is alleged to be the so-called “Golden State Killer,” a suspect believed to have murdered 12 people, raped 45 and burglarized more than 120 homes between 1976 and 1986, according to the FBI. 
The FBI said the suspect raped his first victim in June 1976. His rape and murder victims ranged from 13 to 41 years old and included women at home alone, women at home with their children, and husbands and wives, according to the FBI. 
Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said DNA evidence had been used to identify DeAngelo, 72, as the suspect. DeAngelo worked as a police officer in Auburn, California, from August 1976 to September 1979, according to the Auburn city manager. 
The FBI was searching DeAngelo’s home in Citrus Heights on Wednesday, where public records showed he has lived since 1983. Citrus Heights is about 16 miles northeast of Sacramento.
The “Golden State Killer” is also known as the ""East Area Rapist” and the “Original Night Stalker."" Originally, these were believed to have been different people, but later authorities identified them as the same perpetrator.
The crimes were the subject of a book researched and partially written by Michelle McNamara called, “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman’s Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer.” Her husband, comedian Patton Oswalt, had the book completed and published after McNamara passed away in 2016.

32265,2018-04-27,House Intelligence Committee releases final report on alleged Russian interference,"On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee released a partially redacted version of a final report on its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The 253-page report was authored by the Republican majority members of the House Intelligence Committee. The committee Democrats released a separate 98-page unclassified “Minority Views” report on Friday, saying the Majority’s investigation ended “prematurely” and that the minority would continue its investigation.
The Committee’s report lists 44 findings and 26 recommendations in five chapters: “Russian campaigns in Europe,” “Russia attacks the United States,” “America reacts,” “Campaign links with Russia” and “Intelligence community assessment leaks.” The public release of the document follows the draft report released in March.
Findings
Among other things, the final majority report found:

	There was “no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the Russian government.” 
	There were “failings” in intelligence procedures and technique used in the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) produced in January 2017, specifically in judgments regarding “Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategic objectives for disrupting the U.S. election.”
	The government’s “response to the Russian active measures campaign during the 2016 election was slow.” 
	“Several of the contacts between Trump associates and Russians — or their proxies, including WikiLeaks — were ill-advised.” 
	“Leaks of classified information alleging Russian intentions to help elect candidate Trump increased after the election” and leaks have “damaged national security and potentially endangered lives.”

The “Minority Views” document addressed two of the report’s claims, saying:

	There was “unprecedented effort by the Russian government ... to gain entrée to and influence with individuals associated with the Trump campaign” and “willingness by Trump campaign officials to accept those overtures.”
	The Minority “found no evidence that calls into question the quality and reliability of the ICA’s underlying reporting and key judgments.”

Recommendations
The Committee’s report includes recommendations in the following areas:

	improving election security to protect from cyber threats
	increasing campaign finance transparency
	counterintelligence practices regarding media disclosure

Response to final report
President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday, “Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. ‘No evidence’ that the Trump Campaign ‘colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia.’ Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!”
Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) said the intelligence community redacted too much of the document before its public release. “I am extremely disappointed with the overzealous redactions made by the [intelligence community]. Many of the redactions include information that is publicly available, such as witness names and information previously declassified … I will continue to challenge the [intelligence community]’s many unnecessary redactions with the hopes of releasing more of the report in the coming months,” Conaway said.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top ranking minority member of the committee, said, “Throughout the investigation, Committee Republicans chose not to seriously investigate — or even see, when in plain sight — evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, instead adopting the role of defense counsel for key investigation witnesses.”

32230,2018-04-27,"Korean leaders commit to denuclearization, formal end to Korean War","North and South Korea issued a declaration committing to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and promising to formally end the Korean War. The declaration said the South’s President Moon Jae-in and the North’s leader Kim Jong-un “solemnly declared before the 80 million Korean people and the whole world that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun.” 

The leaders met in the demilitarized zone between the two countries on Friday, as each stepped hand-in-hand onto the North’s side of the line for a moment before proceeding to the South’s side for a welcoming ceremony and talks. After the meeting, the leaders issued a document called the “Panmunjeom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula.” 
The declaration said the two countries would “actively cooperate to establish a permanent and solid peace regime on the Korean Peninsula,” including ending the “unnatural state of armistice” that has existed since 1953, and would “actively pursue” joint talks with the U.S. or the U.S. and China this year to declare an official end to the Korean War.
In addition to committing to peace, the document “confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.” It said, “measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
 The two countries also agreed to:

	adhere to their Non-Aggression Agreement that “precludes the use of force in any form against each other,” and “to carry out disarmament in a phased manner.”
	“improving and cultivating inter-Korean relations” such as through holding dialogues, “fully implementing all” existing agreements between the countries, jointly participating in sporting events, connecting and “moderniz[ing]” inter-Korea land transport routes and re-connecting relatives between the two countries;
	“make joint efforts to alleviate the acute military tension and practically eliminate the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula,” including by establishing a “maritime peace zone,” holding “frequent meetings between military authorities” and ending “hostile acts” such as “broadcasting through loudspeakers” and distributing leaflets in the demilitarized zone by May 1.

This meeting was the first time a North Korean leader had entered the South’s territory since the 1953 armistice. At the talks, Moon also agreed to visit the North’s capital city of Pyongyang in the fall.
Events leading to the meeting
On April 21, North Korea said it would suspend its nuclear weapons tests, and its intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. The country is under U.N. sanctions for past tests, including a nuclear test in September and an intercontinental ballistic missile test in November of last year.
Some countries have held talks with North Korea in the past to negotiate an end to its nuclear weapons program. In 2009, North Korea withdrew from “Six-Party Talks” that included South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia. In February 2012, Kim agreed to suspend the North’s long-range missile and nuclear tests, as well as uranium enrichment, according to the U.S. State Department. In January 2013, North Korea said it planned to conduct long-range missile and nuclear tests again.
US Response
In response to the Korean leaders’ meeting, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “We are hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula.” She added, “We wish the Korean people well.” 
U.S. President Donald Trump is planning to meet with Kim in late May or early June, the White House has said. Mike Pompeo, who was confirmed as secretary of state on Thursday, met with Kim over Easter weekend.

In January 2013, North Korea said it planned to conduct long-range missile and nuclear tests again.
After the meeting
President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Kim in late May or early June, according to the White House. Mike Pompeo, confirmed Thursday as secretary of state, met with Kim over Easter weekend.

32285,2018-04-28,Pennsylvania Rep. Patrick Meehan resigns,"Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) resigned from Congress on Friday, ending a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of misconduct involving a former female aide and a $39,000 payment to her using congressional office funds. He said he didn’t want “any question of violating the trust of taxpayers” and announced he would repay the $39,000 to the Treasury within 30 days of his resignation. 
 
 When the payment became public in January, Meehan said he had the ethics committee’s approval to use the funds and called the money a “severance payment.”
In a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, Meehan said he believed he would have been “exonerated of any wrongdoing.” He said did not want his staff to go through the “rigors” of an ethics committee investigation and did not want the inquiry to be “a burden to taxpayers and committee staff.” 
Meehan, 62, was elected as a congressional representative in 2011. A special election will be needed to fill his seat, to be scheduled by Gov. Wolf. 
Allegations
In January, The New York Times published an article describing allegations that Meehan had made “unwanted romantic overtures” towards a former aide, became “hostile” when she did not reciprocate, and later paid her a settlement that included a nondisclosure agreement. 
Meehan said in an interview that he saw the aide, whose name has not been publicly disclosed, as “a soul mate,” and had “affection” for her. He also said he “never touched her” and “never asked for any kind of a relationship.” 
The aide had filed a complaint with the congressional Office of Compliance, alleging sexual harassment, according to The New York Times. Meehan denied harassing her. 
Meehan announced later in January that he would not seek re-election.

32288,2018-04-28,"Israeli forces kill 3, injure 880 during protests along Gaza border","Israeli forces killed three protesters and injured about 880 along the border with Gaza on Friday during the fifth week of ongoing Palestinian demonstrations, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry said the three people who died had been shot in the head, and that 174 others were injured with live ammunition and 58 by munition fragments. Israel has said its forces have “operated in accordance with the rules of engagement” to protect its border. 
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported earlier this week that 42 Palestinians had been killed and 5,511 wounded since protests began on March 30. The wounded have been treated for injuries resulting from live fire, coated bullets, tear gas inhalation and other injuries. More than 3,350 have been treated in hospitals and the remainder in the field. 
Israeli military said between 12,000 and 14,000 Palestinians participated in Friday’s protests in five locations along the 40-mile (65-km) Israeli-Gaza border. Demonstrators reportedly pulled down Israeli defensive structures using wire cutters and metal hooks, The New York Times reported, and others have approached the border fence in attempts to cross. 
There were conflicting accounts of how Friday’s casualties occurred. Some witnesses cited by the New York Times said two Palestinians neared the border fence and shot at Israeli soldiers with handguns, and the soldiers threw a hand grenade in response. Other witnessed cited by the outlet said the Palestinians who approached the fence did not fire on the soldiers. 
Israeli Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said soldiers used live fire on Friday when 20 to 30 demonstrators made what he called “a serious attempt to tear down the fence.” The Israeli Foreign Ministry did not immediately comment on Friday’s deaths.
The Israeli military has characterized the demonstrations as “riots.” Danny Danon, Israel’s envoy to the U.N. has alleged that Hamas, the political group that controls Gaza and has an armed division, is responsible for the deaths and has used people as “human shields.” “The terrorists are hiding while allowing, even hoping, for their people to die,” Danon alleged.
Hamas denied the allegation and described the protests as peaceful, and protest organizers have said the protests are intended to be “nonviolent resistance.” Hamas also said Dannon’s comments were an attempt to “escape responsibility and to cover up for the execution of unarmed children and people by occupation soldiers.”
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said Israel was using “excessive force” against the demonstrators, calling it “deplorable,” and saying that the number of injuries from live fire was “staggering.”
On March 31, the U.S. blocked a draft resolution by the U.N. Security Council that called for an investigation into the incidents in which Palestinian protesters had been killed until that point.
Stated goals of the demonstrations
The protests, named “The March of Return,” are calling for Palestinians who left Israeli areas during and around the May 1948 war and their descendants to be granted the “right to return” to those areas. Israel said it will not allow the right to return.
Palestinians began demonstrations and sit-ins on the anniversary of “Land Day.” The protests were originally scheduled to last more than six weeks and end on May 15, known as “Nakba Day.” Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas political bureau, said on Wednesday that the protests would continue beyond May 15. “The Palestinian people will demonstrate throughout the month of Ramadan to deal with the many challenges facing us, and first of all the peace plan promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump,” he said.
Land Day is held in remembrance of an incident in which Israeli forces fatally shot six Palestinians on March 30, 1976, as the Palestinians were protesting Israeli land seizures. “Nakba Day” recognizes the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. This year, the Islamic period of Ramadan begins on or around May 15 and will last until around June 14. 
On each Friday, protest organizers have scheduled a theme for the day. This Friday’s theme was “rebellious youth,” Haaretz reported.
More than 2 million Palestinians live within the Gaza territories. Israel withdrew troops from the area in 2005, while maintaining control of the land and sea borders, according to Reuters.

32535,2018-04-30,Netanyahu says ‘Iran lied’ about nuclear weapons program,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he had documents showing “Iran lied” when it said it did not have a nuclear weapons program. Netanyahu said Iran “intensified” efforts to hide “nuclear weapons files” after signing a 2015 agreement to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions. 
Netanyahu made his announcement in English at Israel's defense ministry in Tel Aviv. He said Israel had obtained 183 CDs containing 55,000 files and 55,000 pages of documents that had been kept in vaults in Iran’s capital city of Tehran. During his announcement, Netanyahu showed what he described as “exact copies” of some of the documents, blueprints, photos and videos that he alleged were “incriminating.” Netanyahu said the files had been shared with the U.S. and would be shared with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In 2007, a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report estimate judged with “high confidence” that Iran had a nuclear weapons development program until 2003. The report determined with “moderate confidence” that Iran “had not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid-2007.”
Iranian and US response
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Netanyahu’s allegation was “ridiculous.” 
Before Netanyahu’s announcement, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif posted on Twitter, saying, “The boy who can't stop crying wolf is at it again. Undeterred by cartoon fiasco at UNGA,” an acronym referring to the United Nations General Assembly. The message accompanied a photo of what appeared to be a diagram Netanyahu presented before the U.N. General Assembly in 2012, when he argued that Iran's nuclear enrichment program must be stopped to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said the allegation showed that he was “100% right” to criticize the 2015 nuclear deal, saying it was “not acceptable” that part of the agreement will expire in seven years. Trump has set a May 12 deadline to decide whether to either continue to uphold the agreement and waive sanctions against Iran, renegotiate and “fix” the agreement, or withdraw from it. 
In October of last year, Trump allowed a deadline to pass without recertifying Iran’s compliance with the deal. Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of new sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic missile program. 
The nuclear deal
The nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was put in place in 2015 after 18 months of negotiations. Iran and six other nations signed it: the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. 
The agreement required Iran to give up about 98 percent of its enriched uranium, prohibited the country from producing nuclear weapons, and required it to allow nuclear inspections. 
Some requirements of the deal, such as limits on its uranium stores, are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2031 under various “sunset” clauses (or scheduled termination of certain provisions). In exchange for agreeing to the restrictions, the U.S., European Union and other members of the United Nations lifted some sanctions on oil and other products from Iran.

32483,2018-04-30,Two suicide bombings kill 29 in Kabul,"Two coordinated suicide bombs in Kabul killed at least 29 people and injured 45 on Monday morning, according to officials. The deaths include at least eight journalists from various media outlets, according to Najib Sharifi, director of the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee, revising an earlier report of nine journalist casualties. An Islamic State (IS) affiliate claimed responsibility for the attack.
Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said four of those killed were police officers. Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, said the 45 injured were taken to city hospitals.
The bombs exploded in the central Shash Darak area of the Afghanistan capital, near the local NATO headquarters, U.S. embassy, Afghan presidential palace, Defense Ministry and other government buildings. After the first explosion, which detonated around 8 a.m. local time, journalists arrived on the scene to report on the attack. A second bomber reportedly disguised himself as a news cameraman and detonated explosives near a group of journalists, according to Stanekzai.
Afghan IS affiliate group Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement on an IS-affiliated website. The statement said the first bomb was aimed at the headquarters of the “renegade” Afghan intelligence services, according to AP. The second bomber detonated his explosive vest after officers arrived on the scene, according to the statement. It did not mention journalists specifically being targeted.
Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based media monitoring group also known by its French acronym RSF, said that since 2016, 36 media workers have been killed in Afghanistan in attacks by the Taliban or IS.
The U.S. and NATO ended their combat missions in Afghanistan at the end of 2014; Afghan security forces have been primarily fighting the Taliban and IS since. Both groups aim to establish Islamic rule in the country. 
Recent attacks in Afghanistan

	April 28: A car bomb in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province killed at least six people, including two soldiers. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, CNN reported.
	April 22: At least 57 people were killed, including at least 5 children, and more than 100 were injured in a suicide bombing at a voter registration center. IS claimed responsibility.
	March 23: A car bomb outside a sports stadium in Helmand province killed at least 13 people and wounded 35. According to CNN, no group claimed responsibility.
	March 21: An IS-claimed suicide bombing at a Shiite shrine in Kabul killed at least 32 and injured 65.

32420,2018-04-30,"Caravan immigrants approach, cross US border at San Diego seeking asylum","About 180 people who traveled north from southern Mexico as part of a caravan over the past month had arrived by Saturday in Tijuana, Mexico at the San Ysidro port of entry to the U.S. Fifty immigrants were admitted to the immigration processing center, according to Alex Mensing of Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders), which helped organize the caravan. In a statement on Sunday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said San Ysidro had “reached capacity” and the asylum-seekers ""may need to wait in Mexico” while CBP officers processed those already in the facilities. Some groups of people tried to enter the U.S. illegally by climbing over a metal fence, according to a statement on Saturday by Rodney Scott, San Diego Chief Patrol Agent of CBP. 
Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen issued a statement saying immigrants seeking asylum should do so in the first “safe” country they reach, including Mexico. To qualify for asylum in the U.S., “applicants must prove they have been persecuted or fear persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political belief or membership in a particular group,” according to The New York Times. 
If immigrants request asylum at a port of entry, they are referred to an asylum officer for initial screening, which is called a “credible-fear interview,” and those who pass then present their case before a judge. While waiting for a court date, applicants could be released and if so, they wear an ankle-bracelet monitor, The New York Times reported. Applicants who are rejected in the screening process could be detained and deported.
Scott said it is a crime to enter the U.S. somewhere other than through a port of entry, and that immigrants caught doing so would be “arrested and referred for prosecution.” He also said that anyone who “encouraged” immigrants to illegally enter the U.S., or make any false statements to officials, were “giving bad advice” and placing immigrants and their families at risk.
The caravan is made up of immigrants from Central America who began traveling north from the city of Tapachula, Mexico, on March 25. At one point, the caravan was made up of 1,200 people, according to The New York Times. Some of the immigrants may apply for protection in other countries, such as Mexico, and others may apply for asylum in the U.S. at a later date.
Other caravans have made northward journeys in the past, according to The Washington Post. Media outlets followed the caravan after President Donald Trump tweeted about it on April 1. Volunteer immigration lawyers and paralegals from San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas traveled to Tijuana to help the immigrants with their asylum requests, according to The New York Times.
In an April 23 tweet, Trump said he had “instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country.”

32608,2018-05-01,Demonstrations held worldwide for ‘May Day’,"Labor unions organized demonstrations worldwide on Monday for “May Day,” also known as “International Workers’ Day” and “Labour Day.” The largest demonstration reported by AP was in Moscow, where the Federation of Trade Unions said about 120,000 people marched.
In France, police said more than 20,000 people marched in Paris demonstrations organized by labor unions. Demonstrators were protesting some of President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed labor reforms, which include making it easier for employers to terminate contracts. (Read more here.) A group of more than 1,000 people dressed in black jackets and face masks marched in Paris, with some setting a McDonald’s and vehicles on fire. Police used tear gas and a water cannon on some of the Paris protesters.
In South Korea, police estimated about 10,000 people demonstrated in Seoul in a rally organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. Demonstrators called for the government to convert “non-regular employees,” such as those on fixed-term contracts, part-time employees or day laborers, to “regular employees,” or full-time employees, who receive more pay and benefits. They also called for a higher minimum wage.
In Indonesia, about 10,000 people demonstrated in the capital city of Jakarta, calling for wage increases, a reduction in the number of foreign workers in the country and less outsourcing of labor. 
In the Philippines, about 5,000 people demonstrated in Manila, calling for the government to raise wages, reduce unemployment, end or reduce some restrictions on trade unions, and stop contractualization of short-term employment. Contractualized workers have fewer benefits than permanent employees.
In Spain, there were May Day marches in more than 70 cities, with some calling for gender equality in the workplace, higher salaries and higher pension payments. 
In Turkey, police detained more than 12 people who were marching toward Istanbul’s Taksim Square. Authorities had closed the square to May Day demonstrations, citing security concerns, according to AP. 
In Greece, there were at least 3 separate May Day demonstrations in Athens, with police estimating more than 7,000 people were present for one organized by a union led by a communist party. 
The German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) said a total of about 340,000 people participated in about 500 May Day events in Germany. About 4,000 people marched in Berlin and 12,000 in Vienna, with some calling attention to welfare reductions and workers’ conditions, according to AP.

32605,2018-05-01,"US delays implementing steel, aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico, EU, others","On Monday, the White House announced it was delaying until June 1 its final decisions on whether to continue metal tariff exemptions for Canada, Mexico and the EU. On March 1, President Donald Trump announced import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. On March 23, the U.S. temporarily exempted Canada, Mexico, the EU, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the tariffs until April 30. 
The U.S. said it has reached agreements in principle on exemptions with Australia, Argentina and Brazil. 
In a statement, the White House said, “In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security.”
The World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes an exemption in the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, allowing countries to impose some tariffs under some conditions when “national security” may be affected.
The EU said in a statement the U.S. decision to delay “prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions.” It added that the EU “should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security.”
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the U.S. was considering imposing import quotas that limit the maximum amount of imports from a particular country, in exchange for exempting some countries from the tariffs. 
The U.S. had already announced an agreement with South Korea to exempt it from steel tariffs in exchange for the country reducing its steel exports to the U.S. by about 30 percent.
The top five countries or blocs of countries from which the U.S. imported steel in January 2018 were Canada, the EU, South Korea, Mexico and Brazil, according to BBC.

32550,2018-05-01,Javid takes over as UK Home Secretary after Rudd resigns,"Sajid Javid was named the new U.K. Home Secretary on Monday, after Amber Rudd resigned late on Sunday. Rudd resigned after allegations that she lied to Parliament about immigration deportations. 
Rudd had originally told parliament there were no national quotas for deporting illegal immigrants, then later said they did exist. British newspaper The Guardian reported on Friday that a memo within the Home Office, on which Rudd was copied, mentioned “a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18,” saying “we have exceeded our target of assisted returns.”
In Rudd’s resignation letter, she said she “inadvertently misled” lawmakers and had “become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility that I was not.”
The ‘Windrush Generation’
Rudd’s resignation followed ongoing media coverage criticizing the U.K.’s handling of legal and illegal immigration of the so-called “Windrush generation.” The Windrush generation is named after the ship MV Empire Windrush, which brought Caribbean immigrants to the U.K. after World War II. 
Caribbean immigrants were invited to the U.K. from 1948 to 1971 as part of a program to address labor shortages. Then in 1971, an Immigration Act granted citizens from Commonwealth countries who were already living in the U.K. a permanent residency permit, which gave them indefinite leave to remain in the country. Many people from the so-called Windrush generation arrived on their parents’ passports and never became citizens, according to Al Jazeera. 
In 2012, the U.K. implemented rules that require doctors, landlords and employers to check people’s immigration status. Some immigrants who have not had adequate paperwork, including some from the Windrush generation, have reportedly been denied medical benefits, lost jobs and faced deportation. The rules affect an estimated 50,000 long-term U.K. residents, Al Jazeera reported. 
Javid, the son of a Pakistani immigrant, told parliament on Monday that he’d “do whatever it takes” to address the immigration issues in the U.K. “I want to start by making a pledge, a pledge to those from the Windrush generation who have been in this country for decades and yet have struggled to navigate through the immigration system. This never should have been the case and I will do whatever it takes to put it right,” he said.
U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May was the Home Secretary when the changes to the immigration policy, associated with “Windrush,” were implemented, The Washington Post reported. On April 18, May issued an apology to 12 Caribbean countries for the treatment of the “Windrush generation.” She is scheduled to meet with her new cabinet on Tuesday.

32553,2018-05-01,Stephanie Clifford files defamation suit against Trump,"Stephanie Clifford filed a defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump on Monday over his characterization of her claim of being threatened in 2011 as a “con job.” The suit, filed in New York by Clifford’s lawyer Michael Avenatti, claims she suffered more than $75,000 in damage.
 
 Clifford, a former pornographic film actress who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and that a man threatened her life in 2011 after she attempted to sell her story to an affiliate of In Touch magazine. 
Clifford did not file a police report at the time. She discussed the alleged threat in a 60 Minutes interview and released a composite sketch of the man who allegedly threatened her about two weeks ago. 
In response to the sketch, Trump tweeted on April 18, “A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!” Trump also denies the affair.
“By calling the incident a ‘con job,’ Mr. Trump's statement would be understood to state that Ms. Clifford was fabricating the crime and the existence of the assailant, both of which are prohibited under New York law, as well as the law of numerous other states,” the lawsuit claims. 
Clifford has also filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen, who paid her $130,000 as part of a non-disclosure agreement. That suit alleged Cohen released a denial of the affair that Clifford signed earlier in the year while “knowing it was false or had serious doubts about the truth of the statements.” Last week, a California judge delayed that suit by 90 days while Cohen is being criminally investigated. Avenatti said they plan to file an appeal.

32546,2018-05-01,Malaysia issues first conviction under new ‘fake news’ law,"A Malaysian court sentenced a Danish citizen to one week in jail after he pleaded guilty to making a false statement about police response time to a shooting. The conviction of Salah Salem Saleh Sulaiman, 46, was the first under a new law prohibiting “fake news.” 
Salah was arrested on April 23, two days after he shared a YouTube video in response to the death of Fadi al-Batsh, a Palestinian electrical engineer and member of the political group Hamas who was shot by two people on a motorcycle. Salah said in Arabic on the video that police took 50 minutes to respond to the shooting. According to Malaysia’s inspector general of police, records show police responded within eight minutes of the distress call that was received at 6:41 a.m. local time on April 21. 
Salah, who was not represented by a lawyer, is a Danish citizen of Yemeni descent who was on holiday in Malaysia. He said he made a “mistake” and apologized to Malaysian police and “everybody” in the country, adding that he had posted the video in a “moment of anger” and did not intend harm. “I agree I did a mistake because I didn't ask what is the law of this country,” he said speaking in English.
The court in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur also ordered Salah to pay a fine of 10,000 ringgit ($2,550). He said he would serve an extra month in jail because he did not have the money to pay the fine, an option Judge Zaman Mohamad Noor presented. 
The Malaysian parliament approved the new law on April 2, more than a month before the general election scheduled for May 9. The Anti-Fake News Act defines “fake news” as “news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false.” It applies to written news, social media posts, audio and visual reports, and carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison and up to 500,000 ringgit ($128,000) in fines.

A Malaysian media company, Malaysiakini, has filed a lawsuit against the legislation claiming it is unconstitutional. The constitution grants Malaysian citizens the right to “freedom of speech and expression,” in Art. 8, clause 10(1)(a). Another clause, Art 8, c.10(2)(a), allows the government to impose laws that limit that freedom if it is deemed necessary in the interest of “security of the Federation,” “public order or morality,” to protect the government, or “to provide against contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to any offence.”

The city agreed to pay each man $1 and invest $200,000 in an entrepreneurship program open to Philadelphia public high school students. Police arrested the men after at least one asked to use the restroom without purchasing anything, and a manager had asked them to leave and they did not.

32724,2018-05-02,Protests in Armenia after parliament rejects opposition leader's candidacy for prime minister,"On Tuesday, the Armenian parliament voted to reject opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan’s candidacy for prime minister. After a vote of 45 in favor, 55 against, Pashinyan called on Armenians, including police, to peacefully demonstrate in acts of civil disobedience. On Wednesday, protesters blocked some transport routes to the capital of Yerevan and its airport. Airport workers, medical staff, construction workers, university professors and students joined the protests by holding strikes.
Some metro stations were closed in Yerevan on Wednesday, Al Jazeera reported. Trains were not running between Yerevan and Armenia’s second largest city, Gyumri, and 3,000 sewing factory workers walked out and blocked roads in Vanadzor, BBC reported.
On Wednesday afternoon, Pashinyan asked people on social media to unblock the road to the airport. Local media reported that protestors were allowing ambulances, police and military to pass on blocked roads, according to Al Jazeera. 
Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigned last week after protests led by Pashinyan. Sargsyan had been president for two five-year terms prior to becoming prime minister on April 17. After Sargsyan resigned, former Prime Minister Karan Karapetian became acting prime minister.
Al Jazeera reported that 30,000 to 40,000 people gathered at Republic Square in Yerevan during the parliamentary debate and vote on Pashinyan, which was broadcast on television screens in the square. Arman Saghatelyan, a member of the Republican Party that rules by coalition, said in a speech to parliament, “Mr. Pashinyan, you’re a good parliament member, but not qualified for prime minister.” 
Of the protests, Pashinyan reportedly said, “it isn't a fight for Nikol Pashinyan becoming prime minister, it's a fight for human rights, for democracy, for rule of law and that is why our people aren't tired and won't be tired."" 
Pashinyan was editor of a newspaper that sometimes criticized past presidents, including Sargsyan, and was imprisoned after leading protests against Sargsyan in 2008. The protests became violent and 10 people were killed. Pashinyan was charged with murder and organizing mass unrest, and released under an amnesty in 2011, BBC reported. He was elected to parliament in 2012.
The parliament is scheduled to hold another vote for prime minister on May 8. If it does not elect a new prime minister, elections for a new parliament would be called.
The ruling Republican party said on Wednesday it would not put forward a candidate for prime minister, and would support whichever candidate was nominated by at least one-third of the 105-member parliament, according to The Associated Press. Also on Wednesday, Pashinyan said he had the support of the three opposition parties in parliament, totaling more than one-third of parliament members. Pashinyan said these parties would nominate him for prime minister on Thursday.
Armenia is a former state of the Soviet Union, and has about 2.9 million people.

32770,2018-05-02,"Kanye West says slavery ‘sounds like a choice,’ ‘we’re mentally in prison’","In a Tuesday interview with media outlet TMZ, hip hop artist Kanye West discussed “free” thinking. He said, “When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.” He added, “it’s like we’re mentally in prison.” One of the interviewers, Harvey Levin, asked West about his comments on slavery and “choice,” to which West replied as he motioned with his hands towards his head, “Right now, we’re choosing to be enslaved.”
At one point in the interview, West stood up, turned to the TMZ newsroom and asked, “Do you feel that I’m being free and that I’m thinking free?” A female voice said, “Yes.” 
Black TMZ staffer Van Lathan said, “I think what you’re doing right now is actually the absence of thought.” He added, ""You're entitled to your opinion, you’re entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said.” 
Lathan continued, “We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice. Frankly, I’m disappointed, I'm appalled, and brother I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something to me that’s not real."" West later walked over to Lathan and said, “I’m sorry I hurt you.”
Last week, West tweeted a picture of himself with a hat that said, “Make America Great Again,” President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. West was asked about the hat in the TMZ interview before his comments on slavery. He said, “I’ve never been into politics. I just love Trump. That’s my boy.”
Reaction on social media
Musician Will.I.Am tweeted, “Reality: its not  it Disrespects their suffering...”
Actor and director Wendell Pierce tweeted, “It is clear that @kanyewest is being sensational for the sake of publicity. I could care less about that. But for you to use the murder and holocaust of slavery for your own self aggrandizement is at the core of your vile appeasement of white supremacists."" Pierce also tweeted, “Slavery wasn’t a choice, it was a crime against humanity without a denouement of Justice.”
Director Spike Lee wrote on Instagram, “My brother, OUR ancestors did not choose to be stolen from Mother Africa. OUR ancestors did not choose to be ripped of OUR religion, language, culture.”
Candace Owens, Communications Director for Turning Point USA, which supports free markets and limited government, was at TMZ with West. She tweeted, “The message that @kanyewest is trying to deliver is one of unity. We’ve grown so used to Hollywood preaching “acceptable hate” that love has become a controversial position.” 
Dilbert comic strip creator Scott Adams tweeted a video in which he said of Kanye: “His critics are completely, you know, misinterpreting what he’s saying.“
West tweets after the interview
After the interview, West tweeted, “we need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled pain.” He also tweeted, “we are programmed to always talk and fight race issues. We need to update our conversation.” 
According to BBC, West also tweeted, “to make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will.”
In another tweet, West said “the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought It was just an idea,” according to CNN.
He also tweeted “I freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves. - Harriet Tubman,” CNN reported. Some people said on Twitter that there is no proof Tubman said that, according to CNN.

32649,2018-05-02,17 states sue EPA over decision to rescind 2012 emission standards,"California and 16 other states filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday over its decision to rescind 2012 emissions standards regulations. The regulations, issued under President Barack Obama, required cars and light-duty trucks made by the year 2025 to have fuel efficiency standards of “the equivalent of” 54.5 miles per gallon. Earlier this month, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced the standards were “not appropriate” and later rescinded them.
The Model Year (MY) 2022-2025 standards announced in 2012 were then implemented by the EPA in January 2017. The EPA said at the time the greenhouse gas emission standards determination would be subject to further manufacturing and fuel projections, and set an April 2018 deadline to evaluate if the rules were appropriate. 
On April 2 of this year, the EPA released a statement saying the MY 2022-2025 standards “should be revised.” Pruitt said, “Obama’s EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn’t comport with reality, and set the standards too high.” He said the projections on fuel prices were too low and the standards would be detrimental to automakers and car purchasers. 
Pruitt announced the start of a “joint process” with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to propose “more appropriate” greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards, and open them for comment by the general public. 
On April 13, the EPA revised the MY 2022-2025 emissions standards. A statement from California’s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) said it made the decision “arbitrarily” and “without evidence to support its decision.”
California Gov. Jerry Brown said while announcing Tuesday’s lawsuit, “Pollutants coming out of vehicles, out of the tailpipe, does (sic) permanent lung damage to children living near well-traveled roads and freeways. This is a fact. The only way we’re going to overcome that is by reducing emissions.” 
The other states joining the lawsuit, all with Democratic attorneys general, are: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. They represent roughly 44 percent of the national population and about 43 percent of the new car sales market, according to the California OAG.
The Clean Power Plan of 2015, which Pruitt signed a proposal to withdraw from last year, calls for the regulation of carbon emissions. A waiver from the act allows California to impose its own standards for vehicle emissions limits, and to make them higher than federal standards. The EPA said in its statement earlier this month that it is reexamining that waiver.

32645,2018-05-02,Synthetic opioids involved in 46% of opioid overdose-related deaths in 2016,"A report published on Tuesday found that synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, were involved in at least 46 percent of opioid-related overdose deaths in 2016, an increase from 14 percent of the deaths in 2010. This is the first time recorded that synthetic opioids have surpassed prescription painkillers to account for the highest percentage of opioid-related overdose deaths. 
The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA),  examined death certificates in the National Vital Statistics System. About 15 to 25 percent of overdose deaths did not have specific drugs listed on the death certificates, according to Christopher Jones, a researcher at the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and one of the authors of the study. Jones said this could mean the actual number of opioid-related deaths was higher than the number given in the report.
In 2016, about 19,400 (46 percent) of the 42,249 opioid overdose-related deaths identified in the study involved synthetic opioids, about 17,000 (40 percent) involved prescription painkillers and about 15,000 (37 percent) involved heroin. The sum of the percentages is more than 100 percent because some overdose deaths involved more than one drug. About 80 percent of deaths involving synthetic opioids involved other drugs such as other opioids (48 percent of the time), heroin (30 percent), cocaine (22 percent), prescription opioids (21 percent), alcohol (11 percent), antidepressants (5 percent) and others.
Jones said illicit drug dealers sometimes sell more expensive drugs mixed with less expensive synthetic opioids, and that fentanyl can also be in counterfeit prescription pills.
Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are made in a laboratory, while natural opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone are derived from poppy plants. According to Linda Richter, director of policy research and analysis at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are “about 50 times more potent than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine.” 
Last month, Surgeon General Jerome Adams issued an advisory recommending that people using opioids, or friends and family members of people who use opioids, know how to use naloxone and have it on hand. Naloxone is an anti-overdose medication for opioids.

32640,2018-05-02,NYTimes publishes questions Mueller reportedly has for Trump,"On Monday, The New York Times published a list of at least 48 questions that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators had reportedly submitted to President Donald Trump’s legal team as part of Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and “related matters.” The Times reported that someone “outside” of Trump’s legal team gave it the questions. 
On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, “So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were ‘leaked’ to the media.” In March, Trump said he “would like to” testify before Mueller as part of the investigation.
The Times reported that there were five questions about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, 20 about former FBI Director James Comey, nine about Attorney General Jeff Sessions and 14 about possible Trump campaign communication with Russia.
Questions on Flynn
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak after Trump was elected and before he took office. Flynn resigned on Feb. 13, 2017, saying he “inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect [Mike Pence] and others with incomplete information about my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.”
Some of Mueller’s reported questions for Trump about Flynn would include whether Trump knew about Flynn’s phone calls with Kislyak and how Trump made his decision to fire Flynn. 
Questions on Comey
Trump fired Comey as FBI director in May of last year, saying he “concur[red] with the judgement of the Department of Justice” that Comey was “not able to effectively lead the bureau.” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had written a memo to Trump that said, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [Hillary] Clinton’s emails.”
Mueller’s reported questions on Comey involve: Trump’s thoughts on Comey’s Jan. 6, 2017 intelligence briefing to him about alleged Russian election interference; the details and  purpose of meetings between Trump and Comey in January and February 2017; why Trump fired Comey and when he decided to do so; and clarifications about some of Trump’s statements regarding Comey in interviews and tweets. 
Questions on Sessions
Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation on March 2, 2017, after incorrectly testifying at his February 2017 confirmation hearing that he had no contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. He later said he met Kislyak twice, both times in his role as a senator and not in relation to the Trump campaign. In July of last year, Trump said, “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.”
According to the Times, Mueller would ask Trump if he discussed whether Sessions would “protect” him, Trump’s reaction to Mueller’s appointment (which was made by Rosenstein rather than Sessions), and what discussions Trump may have had about terminating Mueller.
Questions on possible contact between Russia and the Trump campaign
Regarding communications between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mueller would reportedly ask when Trump became aware of Donald Trump Jr’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016. The published questions also address: any discussions Trump may have had during the campaign regarding Russian sanctions, Trump’s knowledge of alleged Russian hacking during the campaign, and what Trump may have known about any of his campaign members contacting Russia “about potential assistance to the campaign.”
The Mueller investigation has not resulted in any charges related to coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

32730,2018-05-03,"Cambridge Analytica to close, citing ‘unfairly negative media coverage’","Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL Group are closing, according to SCL Group’s chair, Julian Wheatland. Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that “unfairly negative media coverage” had “driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers.” Media outlets had covered the political data analytics firm’s data gathering from as many as 87 million Facebook users. The firm’s U.S. workers were asked to immediately return their keycards, according to Gizmodo.
Cambridge Analytica said it would begin bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S., and that its British counterpart SCL Elections Ltd. had “filed applications to commence insolvency proceedings in the U.K.” Cambridge Analytica said it “has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.”
Cambridge Analytica has conducted research to inform campaign efforts for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

32727,2018-05-03,"Texas, six other states sue US to declare DACA ‘unlawful’","On Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) filed a lawsuit against the federal government arguing that the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was “unlawful.” The suit, issued against the U.S. and five federal government officials, is seeking “declaratory and injunctive relief.” The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Brownsville, and was brought by Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia. All seven states have Republican attorneys general.
The five government officials listed as defendants are: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan, Deputy Director and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan, Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services L. Francis Cissna, and Acting Chief of U.S. Border Patrol Carla Provost.
DACA is a program that provides temporary work permits and protection from deportation to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors, provided they meet certain criteria. It was authorized by the executive branch through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2012.
Paxton said Wednesday’s lawsuit “is about the rule of law, not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy.” He said, “DACA sets a dangerous precedent by giving the executive branch sweeping authority to ignore the laws enacted by Congress and change our nation’s immigration laws to suit a president’s own policy preferences.”
The suit asks for the court to prohibit the government “from issuing or renewing DACA permits in the future, effectively phasing out the program within two years.”
Last September, President Donald Trump said DACA would be phased out, with no new work permits or renewals issued after March 5. The DHS also issued a memo then rescinding DACA. Earlier this year, rulings from U.S. district courts in California and New York ordered the government to continue renewing DACA work permits while those courts heard cases on the program; the rulings did not require the government to accept new applications for the program. 
On April 25, a U.S. district court in the District of Columbia ruled that DHS had 90 days to “better explain” its decision to terminate DACA, or the court would require the government to accept new applications.

West in the News
2005: During the Live 8 concert tour, which raises awareness of global poverty and AIDS, West said AIDS was a “man-made disease” that was “placed in Africa just like crack was placed in the black community to break up the Black Panthers.” 
About two months later, West discussed then-President George W. Bush’s handling of Hurricane Katrina during NBC's “A Concert for Hurricane Relief.” West said, “George Bush doesn't care about black people.” He also criticized the media, adding, “I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says they're looting. See a white family, it says they're looking for food.”
2009: West interrupted singer Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards after she won for Best Female Video. West walked on stage while Swift was talking and took the microphone to say that Beyoncé had “one of the best videos of all time.” West later apologized to Swift.
2010: In President Bush’s memoir “Decision Points,” he described West’s Hurricane Katrina comments as an “all-time low” point of his presidency. In response to Bush’s memoir, on a Houston-based radio show, West said he could understand how Bush felt because he had also been called racist. He added, “With both situations, it was strictly a lack of compassion that America saw. You know, with him not rushing, not taking the time to rush down to New Orleans. With me, it was the lack of compassion in cutting someone off in their moment. Nonetheless, I think we're all quick to pull a race card in America. And now I'm more open, and the poetic justice that I went through the same thing that he went through, and now I really more connect with him on a humanitarian level, because that next morning, when he felt that, I felt that same thing too.”
2011: During a performance in England, West said: “I walk through the hotel and I walk down the street, and people look at me like I'm insane, like I'm Hitler,” he said. “One day the light will shine through and one day people will understand everything I ever did.”
2014: During a performance in Australia, West asked all audience members to stand. When two people did not stand, he halted the show until someone could investigate why. One person was in a wheelchair, the other had a prosthetic leg. Once he became aware of their condition, he continued with the performance. West’s actions received criticism on Twitter and other social media platforms, according to The Daily Mail.
2015: After musician Beck won the Grammy for “Album of the Year,” West walked onto the stage, then stopped and walked back down. After the show, West said Beck should have given the award to Beyoncé. West publicly apologized to Beck three weeks later.
2016: At a concert in San Jose, Calif., West told the audience that he didn't vote in the presidential election, but he “would've voted on Trump.” He described Trump's campaign as “absolutely genius.” He also said he intends to run for president in 2020. According to USA Today, audience members shouted expletives at West as he left the stage.
2018: In a Tuesday interview with media outlet TMZ, West discussed “free” thinking. He said, “When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.” He added, “it’s like we’re mentally in prison.”",Arts and Entertainment|Context,USA,,Kanye West,,hip-hop|music,world_news,publish
32871,2018-05-04,"Giuliani says Trump did not know ‘specifics’ of payments to Cohen, Clifford","On Fox News’ “Hannity” show on Wednesday, one of Trump’s attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, spoke about several topics including a $130,000 payment by Trump attorney Michael Cohen to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford. Giuliani said Trump had Cohen on a retainer and “didn’t know about the specifics” of Cohen’s use of the money to pay Clifford, also known as “Stormy Daniels.” The payment was part of a non-disclosure agreement about an affair Clifford allegedly had with Trump in 2006.
Giuliani said Trump paid Cohen a $35,000 monthly retainer “over several months” when Cohen “was doing no work for the president.” Giuliani added, “That's how [Trump’s] repaying it, with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes.” Giuliani later said Trump paid Cohen for unspecified “expenses,” and Trump did not know that the money was going towards the 2016 payment to Clifford. Giuliani said Trump became aware of this payment after the case became public.
Last month, Trump responded to a reporter’s question on Air Force One to indicate that he did not know about the payment Cohen made to Clifford. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, ""This was information that the president didn't know at the time but eventually learned.”
Clifford’s attorney, Michael Avenatti, tweeted on Wednesday evening: ""We predicted months ago that it would be proven that the American people had been lied to as to the $130k payment and what Mr. Trump knew, when he knew it and what he did in connection with it.” In another tweet he said, “Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied.” “AF1” may be a reference to Air Force One.
Possible reasons for the payment to Clifford
The government accountability group Common Cause has filed complaints with the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission regarding the payment to Clifford. Paul S. Ryan, an attorney for Common Cause, said, “this payment was to influence the election.” 
Giuliani said the payment “was about personal reputation. The money wasn’t paid to help the campaign or hurt the campaign.”
Former Federal Election Commission Chairman Bradley Smith, a Republican, said that to show there was a violation of federal election laws, election commissioners would require evidence that the payment’s effect on Trump’s campaign was “the” motivation, not “a” motivation for it.
Trump’s tweets regarding Cohen’s payment to Clifford
On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted three tweets that together read, “Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair, despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll (sic) in this transaction.”

32848,2018-05-04,Arizona to raise teachers’ salaries; week-long teachers’ strike to end,"On Thursday, Arizona’s governor signed a $10.4 billion budget bill that raises teachers’ salaries by 20 percent over a three-year period. Some Arizona school districts have been closed since last Thursday while teachers went on strike for higher pay. Hundreds of teachers demonstrated in Phoenix on Wednesday night. After the law was passed, organizers called for an end to the strike. Some schools announced they would reopen Friday, others next week.
The budget bill includes more than $600 million for salary increases, with about a 10 percent raise the first year, and raises of about 5 percent in the second and third years. The average yearly pay for an Arizona teacher is currently more than $10,000 below the national average of $59,000, according to Reuters. 
Arizona Governor Doug Doucey (R) said, “Arizona teachers have earned a raise … They work incredibly hard.” He said the budget plan also provides “millions in flexible dollars to improve” the state’s public education system. 
The budget allocates an additional $371 million to education over five years, with $100 million this fiscal year. About $2 billion had been cut from schools’ “capital funding” in the state since the end of the last U.S. recession in 2009, according to the Arizona School Board Association (ASBA). “Capital funding” pays for textbooks, desks, school buses and school technology, among other things, according to ASBA.
Arizona has 1.1 million public school students, according to Reuters.
Earlier this year, teachers in West Virginia went on strike for nine school days before obtaining a 5 percent raise, and teachers in Kentucky and Oklahoma also held walkouts over salaries, pensions and education funding.

32845,2018-05-04,Trump signs order to establish ‘White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative’,"On Thursday, the National Day of Prayer, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative.” A White House fact sheet said the order was “to ensure that the faith-based and community organizations that form the bedrock of our society have strong advocates in the White House and throughout the Federal Government.”
The order revoked two previous executive orders, including one from 2001 titled “Establishment of White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.” It also replaced some of the wording in past executive orders, such as replacing “White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative” with “White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.”
The Fact Sheet said the order will:

	“provide recommendations” on the “policy agenda affecting faith-based and community programs”; 
	provide recommendations on programs and policies that may have “more effective solutions to poverty” with faith-based and community organization involvement;
	“apprise the Administration of any failures of the executive branch to comply with religious liberty protections under law”; and 
	“reduce the burdens on the exercise of free religion.” 

The initiative is to be led by a new position: Advisor to the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative. The executive order said the advisor will make recommendations “regarding changes to policies, programs, and practices that affect the delivery of services by faith-based and community organizations.” The order specifies that “executive departments and agencies” that do not have a Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiative will designate a liaison “as a point of contact” for the initiative.
Trump said regarding the order, ""We take this step because we know that in solving the many many problems and our great challenges, faith is more powerful than government and nothing is more powerful than God.”

Jaipur District Divisional Commissioner T Ravi Kant said, “most of the deaths occurred after walls and roofs of houses collapsed in the middle of the night.” Authorities also said trees falling on houses and cars caused some deaths.
At least 35 people died and more than 200 were injured in the state of Rajasthan. Officials said more than 8,000 electricity poles and hundreds of trees had been knocked down by the winds. Kant said there were “widespread” electricity outages and water shortages. 
In the state of Uttar Pradesh, at least 73 people died and 160 were injured, with 43 of those deaths in the city of Agra, which is about 125 miles (201 km) southeast of the capital, New Delhi. The meteorological department at the Indian Air Force’s Kheria base said that up to 1.9 inches (48.2 mm) of rain fell in less than three hours on Wednesday evening in the Agra district. Agra’s Additional District Magistrate Rakesh Malpani said the government would pay about $6,000 (400,000 Indian Rupees) to each family that lost someone as a result of the storm.
Uttar Pradesh’s government expects the number of deaths and people injured to increase over the next two days, as winds continue to be forecast.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he was “saddened by the loss of lives,” and said he had asked officials to coordinate with state governments to assist those affected.

Lava and gases erupted from a fissure in the Leilani Estates subdivision at around 4:30 p.m. local time following a magnitude 5.0 earthquake recorded at about 10:30 a.m. Thursday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO). The eruption of lava and gases ended around 6:30 p.m. with lava spreading less than 33 feet (about 10 meters) from the fissure. No other eruptions have been reported, according to HVO.
There have been at least 600 smaller earthquakes in the area since Monday generated from the flow of underground magma, according to geologist Janet Babb with the HVO. While the lava flow has stopped at the Leilani Estates fissure, the eruption event may not be over and it is not possible to forecast how long it might last, according to Babb.
Also on Thursday, Hawaii Gov. David Ige ordered the state National Guard to help with evacuations and to provide security for evacuated buildings.

33053,2018-05-06,Nobel Prize in Literature postponed until next year,"The 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature will be postponed until 2019, according to the Swedish Academy, the group responsible for awarding the prize. The group said in a statement on Friday that there have been five occasions in the past when an award has been delayed, and that the group was doing so this time “in view of the currently diminished Academy and the reduced public confidence in the Academy.” 
The academy didn’t specify in a statement what it meant by “diminished” or “reduced public confidence.” In April, six academy members resigned following a vote to remove a member, Katarina Frostenson, for allegedly giving her husband, Jean-Claude Arnault, information about prize winners. Arnault has been accused of sexual assault and harassment, and leaking award information. Arnault’s lawyer has said he denies the allegations.
According to a Nobel Foundation press release, an award may be postponed when the decision “will not be perceived as credible.” The foundation said “it presumes that the Swedish Academy will now put all its efforts into the task of restoring its credibility.”
The academy is only responsible for the literature award. The Nobel Foundation said the group’s decision to postpone the prize does not impact “the awarding of the 2018 Nobel Prizes in other prize categories.”
The Academy was founded in 1786. It is made up of 18 members who receive lifetime appointments to the group. Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel appointed the academy in his will to award the the Nobel Prize in Literature. The group began giving out the award in 1901.
Media outlets described the following events involving the Academy since last November:

	In November of last year, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that 18 women had made allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer who is married to Katarina Frostenson, an academy member.
	His accusers alleged some incidents of assault took place at properties owned by the academy.
	Dagens Nyheter also accused Arnault of leaking the names of prize winners ahead of the official announcement. Frostenson allegedly disclosed the information to him.
	The academy held a vote on whether to remove Frostenson from the group, for her alleged disclosure of award information. The vote did not pass.
	On April 6, three members of the academy announced their resignation. Academy member Anders Olsson said he thought “main reason they left” was because they disagreed with the vote outcome.
	Three additional members of the academy resigned the following week, including Permanent Secretary of the academy Sara Danius and Frostenson.
	A preliminary investigation into the assault allegations against Arnault is ongoing. Arnault’s lawyer has denied the allegations — including that of leaking information — on his behalf.

33245,2018-05-07,Iranian President Rouhani outlines options if US withdraws from nuclear deal,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani outlined options on Monday if President Donald Trump decides to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear agreement. His comments came after Trump said the U.S. would withdraw if the signatories didn’t “fix” what he called “significant flaws” in the deal. Rouhani said Iran could remain in the agreement if the other non-American signatories “guaranteed” his country’s interests. The Iranian president also said the country was considering all options, including the possibility it would resume nuclear activity if the deal was terminated completely. 
Trump said on Monday he would announce his decision on the agreement on Tuesday, prior to the May 12 deadline he originally set. “I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm,” Trump tweeted.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement, signed in 2015 after 18 months of negotiations, lifted some economic and diplomatic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits to its nuclear program. Iran, the U.S., Russia, China, France, Germany and the United Kingdom are party to the agreement. (Read more background on JCPOA here.)
In January, Trump announced that he was “waiving the application of certain nuclear sanctions, but only in order to secure our European allies’ agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal,” saying that he would withdraw from the deal if the “flaws,” including scheduled termination of some of the clauses, weren’t adequately addressed. The next deadline for Trump to continue to waive the sanctions is May 12. 
Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of lying when it said it had never had a nuclear weapons program, and that Iran “intensified” efforts to hide “nuclear weapons files” after signing JCPOA. As part of ongoing JCPOA inspections, the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency has certified that Iran does not have nuclear weapons. 
Rouhani said Monday, “What Iran wants is our interests to be guaranteed by its non-American signatories,” and if that means removing the U.S. from the agreement it would “be fine” for Iran. 
“If they want to make sure that we are not after a nuclear bomb, we have said repeatedly that we are not and we will not be,” Rouhani said, adding the deal “ensures that Iran does not seek” nuclear weapons. “But if they want to weaken Iran and limit its influence whether in the region or globally, Iran will fiercely resist,” Rouhani said. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also said the country was considering withdrawing from JCPOA if the U.S. does. The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the country would resume enriching uranium within days if JCPOA is terminated.
The French and German foreign ministers, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas, announced after a joint meeting that their countries, along with the U.K., remain committed to the agreement. “We don’t think there is any justifiable reason to pull out of this agreement and we continue to make the case for it to our American friends,” Maas said. 
What could happen if the US withdraws?
JCPOA has a dispute resolution mechanism that grants at least 35 days to address a claim that a party has violated terms. This time period can be extended if all parties agree. If after having followed this procedure, a party determines the complaint is unresolved, it can choose to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA and notify the U.N. Security Council. The Security Council can vote on a resolution to determine whether to keep the sanctions lifted. If such a resolution does not pass, the former U.N. sanctions would be reimposed, unless the Security Council decides otherwise.
Five of the six non-Iranian JCPOA members are also permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (Germany being the exception), and thus have a right to veto, which can prevent a resolution or decision from being adopted. The previous U.N. sanctions included a ban on the import and export of nuclear materials, a ban on arms exports, asset freezes and travel bans. 
If the Security Council rejects a U.S. motion to terminate JCPOA, the U.S. can reimpose its own sanctions on Iran. As part of JCPOA, the U.S. had lifted sanctions on financial and banking transactions with Iran and investments in the oil industry, as well as prohibitions on commercial aircraft sales to Iran. Under U.S. law, there would be an 180 day delay on reimposing penalties on U.S banks for violating sanctions, according to Iran Daily.

33135,2018-05-07,Gina Haspel to continue with nomination for CIA head,"On Friday, Gina Haspel reportedly considered withdrawing her nomination for CIA director before agreeing on Saturday afternoon to continue with the process, according to unnamed officials cited by The Washington Post. Haspel had been called to the White House on Friday to answer questions from officials, including questions about her role in interrogations that used waterboarding and other coercive interrogation techniques, according to the Post. Haspel said she did not want her nomination to “hurt” the CIA or to have attacks on her reputation, the Post reported.  
After learning Haspel was considering withdrawing her nomination, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders traveled to Haspel’s office in Langley, Virginia, to meet with her. After the discussions, Haspel decided to continue with her nomination, according to the Post.
Haspel, 61, was nominated to the position of CIA director by President Donald Trump in March. Haspel is the CIA’s deputy director and has been the agency’s acting director since former Director Mike Pompeo left the position to become U.S. Secretary of State. She has worked with the CIA since 1985, and has been undercover for some of her tenure. Haspel’s Senate confirmation hearing begins Wednesday with the Senate Intelligence Committee. After confirmation hearings, nominations are put to a vote in the Senate. 
Haspel is the first woman to be nominated as CIA director and, if confirmed, will be the first woman to lead the CIA.
2002 CIA interrogations
In 2002, Haspel was overseeing a CIA detention facility in Thailand where terror suspect Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was interrogated, at one point with waterboarding. Another suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was interrogated at the same facility before Haspel arrived. At the time, the interrogation program was “authorized by the president, deemed legal by administration lawyers and briefed to members of Congress,” according to the Post. During his presidency, Barack Obama signed executive orders to end CIA secret prisons and ban coercive interrogation methods. 
Haspel later served as chief of staff to Jose Rodriguez, who headed the CIA’s clandestine operations. In 2005, he reportedly ordered videotapes of the interrogations to be destroyed and Haspel’s name was on the order. The destruction of the tapes was investigated by a special prosecutor and ultimately no charges were filed.

The mosque was being used for prayers and as a voter registration center for parliamentary elections that are scheduled for October. The Taliban has denied responsibility, and no group has claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Also on Sunday, seven Indian electrical engineers and their driver were abducted by Taliban gunmen in the northern Afghan province of Baghlan, according to BBC. The engineers were en route to a power station when they were abducted. Power is imported from central Asian countries to Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, through that region, the Associated Press reported.

33132,2018-05-07,Colorado State University to change tour policies after police question 2 prospective students,"On April 30, Colorado State University (CSU) police pulled two teenage brothers of Native American descent out of a campus tour and questioned them. Police were responding to a 911 call from a woman on the tour, who said the teenagers looked as if “they don’t belong.” Police let the teens rejoin the tour after one of them showed the officers an email with a reservation for the tour. The university later tweeted, “We deeply regret the unwelcoming and concerning experience they had while guests on our campus,” and said it would change its tour policies, including providing guests with badges or lanyards.
The two brothers, Kanewakeron Thomas Gray, 19, and Skanahwati Lloyd Gray, 17, had joined the tour late after driving about seven hours from their home in New Mexico. The woman who called 911 mentioned their lateness to the dispatcher. She said the teens did not respond to some questions people asked of them, and that they were wearing black clothing with “weird symbolism or wording on it.” While on the tour, Thomas wore a black shirt and Lloyd wore a sweatshirt, both from death metal bands.
The woman reportedly said she thought the teens were lying. She said one of them laughed after she asked the other what he was thinking of studying. Thomas, the older of the two, said in an interview that he is interested in earning a doctorate in music, and his brother plans to major in visual arts.
The woman, who was touring the campus with her husband and at least two of her children, said, “One of them had his left hand in his oversized sweatshirt the whole time.” She added, “I’m probably being completely paranoid with everything that’s happened.” She said her husband told her another man on the tour also “believes [the teens] don’t belong.” 
The female campus police dispatcher asked if they were white males. The woman responded that she thought they were Hispanic and that one had said he is from Mexico.
On Friday, the university released the police report and one of the officers’ body camera footage from the incident, with some editing to blur the teens’ faces and delete audio portions. In the body cam footage, one officer tells Lloyd to get his hand out of his pocket, and then the officer pats down the pockets of Lloyd’s sweatshirt. One of the officers asked why the teens did not respond to questions on the tour, and Thomas said Lloyd is shy. Lloyd showed the police his ID and an email on his phone confirming that they had signed up for the campus tour.
One of the officers told the teens as he let them go, “Sorry to take you away from the group. Have a good rest of your day.” The tour had moved on and the teens were not able to rejoin it. The university said the tour guide was “unaware that police had been called or responded,” and the group had continued without the teens.
CSU responds
On May 2, three administration vice presidents sent an email to students as part of their “commitment to be transparent in communicating about issues related to race occurring on our campus.” They said, “this incident is sad and frustrating from nearly every angle, and that they “deeply regret the experience of these students while they were guests on our campus.”
On Friday, the university’s president, Dr. Tony Frank, said the school had been unsuccessful in contacting the Grays, and wanted to offer them reimbursement for their travel expenses and a V.I.P. tour of the campus. 
Frank said the school had been discussing potential changes to how it manages campus tours and that it would “move as soon as possible” to provide badges or lanyards for tour guests identifying them as visitors. He also said the school would have campus police contact tour guides if they wanted to talk to a tour member, and that tour guides would give introductions to people on their tours so that “anyone with questions or concerns views the tour guide as the first point of contact.”
Frank also said, “People of all races, gender identities, orientations, cultures, religions, heritages, and appearances belong [at CSU].”
The Grays respond
Thomas said his family had not decided if the teens would return to the university or whether they would apply there. He said on Friday, “We drove seven hours to pretty much get the cops called on us.” 
On Friday, the teens’ mother, Lorraine, said, “My immediate thought was they’re being profiled because they’re different.” Lorraine Gray is an “indigenous activist,” according to The Guardian.
One of the officers mentioned in his report that he spoke to Lorraine on the phone. He said, “I explained to her that law enforcement is obligated to follow up on any call that we receive and that the reporting party was suspicious because of the boys’ actions alone.”
The teens are originally from the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne in New York and had moved to New Mexico about a decade ago.

33351,2018-05-08,NY Attorney General resigns following abuse allegations,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced his resignation late Monday after The New Yorker published four accounts from women accusing Schneiderman of physical violence. Schneiderman issued a statement saying, “In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office.”
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for an investigation into the allegations. “No one is above the law, including New York’s top legal officer. I will be asking an appropriate New York District Attorney(s) to commence an immediate investigation, and proceed as the facts merits (sic),” Cuomo said in a statement. On Tuesday, New York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood was named the state's acting attorney general.
According to The New Yorker, the four women accused Schneiderman of subjecting them to “non-consensual physical violence.” Two of the women – Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam – went on-record, alleging Schneiderman slapped and choked them, sometimes after drinking. Manning Barish and Selvaratnam had not filed police reports but had sought medical attention for their alleged injuries. 
Both women also said Schneiderman threatened to kill them if they left him. According to the New Yorker, a spokesperson for Schneiderman denied he made such threats. The two other women who requested not to be identified also made claims of non-consensual physical abuse.
Manning Barish dated Schneiderman from the summer of 2013 until the end of 2015. Selvaratnam dated him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017.
Schneiderman, 63, won a state Senate seat representing a Manhattan district in 1998, and became attorney general in 2010. He was running for re-election this year.

33347,2018-05-08,Trump announces US withdrawal from Iran agreement,"President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday the U.S. will withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In his announcement, Trump authorized his administration to “immediately begin the process of re-imposing sanctions related to the JCPOA,” including sanctioning Iran’s energy, petrochemical and financial sectors.
“Those doing business in Iran will be provided a period of time to allow them to wind down operations in or business involving Iran. Those who fail to wind down such activities with Iran by the end of the period will risk severe consequence,” the announcement said.
According to the U.S. Treasury Department, various agencies will start implementing “90-day and 180-day wind-down periods for activities involving Iran that were consistent with the U.S. sanctions relief specified in the JCPOA.” The Treasury said it plans to “revoke, or amend, as appropriate” licenses issued in connection with the JCPOA “as soon as is administratively feasible.”
The White House referenced recently released Israeli intelligence as evidence that Iran “did not come clean about its nuclear weapons activity” when it entered the JCPOA. The alleged evidence released by Israel had previously been documented by U.S. and international agencies in the early 2000s. (See timeline for more.)
On Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran could remain in the agreement if the other non-American signatories “guaranteed” his country’s interests. The Iranian president also said the country was considering all options, including the possibility it would resume nuclear activity if the deal was terminated completely. After Trump’s Tuesday speech, Rouhani said Iran would take a few weeks to decide how to respond.
Senior officials from Britain, France and Germany met in Brussels on Tuesday with Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, Abbas Araghchi, to discuss their continued support for the JCPOA, the Associated Press reported.
Trump signed a presidential memorandum after his speech.

33389,2018-05-08,New Ebola cases reported in Democratic Republic of Congo,"The Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) health ministry on Tuesday reported 21 suspected cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, including 17 deaths. The cases were reported in Bikoro, and it was the DRC's ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976, when the viral disease was first identified.
Ebola virus disease is caused by one of five Ebola viruses. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads through human-to-human contact through bodily fluids. Ebola has an incubation period of between two and 21 days. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headaches, and a sore throat, which is sometimes followed by vomiting, diarrhea, skin lesions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding. The disease has an average case fatality rate of about 50 percent, according to CNN.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said lab tests confirmed the presence of Ebola in two out of five samples collected from patients. ""WHO is working closely with the government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners, using the model of a successful response to a similar outbreak in 2017,"" it said in a statement.
The WHO said it had released $1 million (840,000 euros) from an emergency contingency fund and set up a coordination group, and called on around 50 “experts” to work with the DRC government and health agencies. It also notified neighboring countries about the new cases.
""We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control, and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa.
The last Ebola outbreak occurred in 2017 in the DRC’s northern Bas Uélé province, and was contained due to efforts by the government, the WHO and other partners, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Four people died during the 2017 outbreak in DRC.

33290,2018-05-08,Hezbollah and supporting parties win majority seats in Lebanon’s parliamentary elections,"On Sunday, Lebanon held its first elections since 2009 with the Shiite Hezbollah party and parties that support it winning 65 of the 128 seats in parliament, according to official results cited by Reuters. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri’s Future Movement party won 21 seats, fewer than the 33 it previously held. 
Hariri’s Future Movement has maintained its position as the largest Sunni Muslim bloc in the House and Hariri will likely to be asked to form the new national unity cabinet, according to BBC. In Lebanon, the power sharing system requires the prime minister to be a Sunni Muslim, the president to be a Maronite Christian, and the parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Parliamentary seats are divided in accordance with quotas according to the religious sects.
Voter turnout on Sunday was 49.2 percent of 3.6 million eligible voters, compared with 54 percent in 2009, according to Reuters.
Lebanon’s 2013 elections were delayed when Members of Parliament (MPs) extended their terms because parties could not agree on a new electoral law, BBC reported. The system was later changed from first-past-the-post (FPTP) to a proportional representation (PR) system. 
FPTP refers to election systems that grant a seat to the candidate who receives the most votes in his or her district, similar to the U.S. system. PR electoral systems grant seats to candidates based on the percentage of total votes that party receives. For example, in a basic PR system, if a party receives 25 percent of the votes, it would get to fill 25 percent of the seats with its preferred candidates, regardless of the local area in which each candidate lives.  
Hezbollah
Hezbollah is a political, military and social organization. It is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel. The group has sent thousands of fighters to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s conflict against Syrian rebel groups and the Islamic State. 
Two of Hezbollah’s allies in Lebanon are the Shiite Amal Movement and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement. Hezbollah is also supported by Iran, according to The Washington Post. 
Leaders’ responses
Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said the election result was a “political and moral victory” and that the new government should form quickly and through cooperation. 
Prime Minister Hariri said, “My hand is extended to every Lebanese who participated in the elections to preserve stability and create jobs.” He added about the voter turnout, “The problem with this election: a lot of people didn't understand it,” referring to the new electoral system. 
Samir Geagea, leader of the Christian opposition party Lebanese Forces, said the election results showed a “popular ground” that would give “strength” to a coalition known as “March 14,” which opposes Hezbollah, to “fix the path.” The March 14 coalition won a parliamentary majority in 2009 and was supported by Saudi Arabia, but the alliance had disbanded, according to Reuters.

33266,2018-05-08,Trump tweets about Mueller investigation,"On Monday, President Donald Trump tweeted criticisms of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian election interference, possible Trump campaign cooperation with Russia, possible obstruction of justice and “related matters.” The president said there were “unrevealed Conflicts of Interest” in Mueller’s team of investigators, and said the continued investigation could “wrongfully” impact November’s midterm elections. 
The special counsel’s office declined to comment on Trump’s tweets, The New York Times reported.
Trump tweeted on Monday morning, “The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it’s called Fighting Back.” 
The House Intelligence Committee released its final report on alleged Russian interference on April 27, which said there was “no evidence” the Trump campaign conspired with Russia. The committee Democrats released a minority report that said the investigation concluded “prematurely,” and that supported the Intelligence Community Assessment regarding Russia’s alleged interference into the election.
In his next tweet, Trump wrote, “The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!”
Mueller’s investigation has 17 staff attorneys, twelve of whom are registered Democrats, according to independent verification by PolitiFact. A thirteenth wrote “I’m a Democrat” in a 2012 opinion piece. Two others are registered to vote with no party affiliation chosen, and PolitiFact was unable to independently verify any affiliation for the other two. Mueller is a registered Republican. The Department of Justice is prohibited from discriminating in hiring practices on the basis of political affiliation, in accordance with the Civil Service Reform Act.
Trump’s comment about the court system may refer to a statement last Friday by U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who told Mueller’s team, “You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort. You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.” Paul Manafort is a former campaign manager for Trump who pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud, money laundering and tax evasion unrelated to the presidential campaign.
Trump also tweeted, “Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!” He did not provide evidence the investigation was “phony” or elaborate on how it might impact the midterm elections.
Mueller’s investigation has at this point indicted Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Alex van der Zwaan, Richard Pinedo and 13 Russian nationals. Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, van der Zwaan and Pinedo pleaded guilty to various crimes including lying to the FBI.

33261,2018-05-08,Melania Trump announces ‘BE BEST’ initiative,"First Lady Melania Trump announced on Monday her “BE BEST” initiative to help children, saying its “three main pillars” included addressing “well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.” During her speech, Trump said it is “our generation’s moral imperative to take responsibility and help our children manage the many issues they are facing today.” 
The BE BEST website says that with a “solid foundation” of the values of “healthy living, encouragement, kindness, and respect,” children will be better able to deal with issues around opioid abuse and negative social media. 
With respect to opioid abuse, the initiative seeks to teach parents about healthy pregnancies and bring attention to neonatal abstinence syndrome, which results in infants experiencing addiction while in the womb and withdrawal after birth due to a mother’s dependence on drugs during pregnancy. 
On the topic of social media, the BE BEST website says it is “our responsibility as adults” to educate children to “choose their words wisely and speak with respect and compassion,” both verbally and online. 
Following Melania Trump’s announcement in the Rose Garden at the White House, she invited her husband President Donald Trump to sign a proclamation making May 7 “Be Best” Day.

33465,2018-05-09,North Korea releases 3 American detainees during Pompeo visit,"North Korea released three Korean-American detainees on Wednesday after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for about 90 minutes. Pompeo was in North Korea to make arrangements for a Trump-Kim meeting, previously announced by the White House and planned for late May or early June. The three Americans flew with Pompeo to Japan and were scheduled to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington at 2 a.m. local time on Thursday. 
President Donald Trump also said on Wednesday he would announce the location of the meeting with Kim within three days, saying it would not be in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
“I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting,” Trump tweeted. “They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date  and Kim Dong-chul, a pastor. North Korean authorities detained Kim Hak-song in May 2017 on suspicion of “hostile acts,” Tony Kim in April 2017 for alleged espionage, and Kim Dong-chul in 2015 for alleged espionage. North Korean authorities had sentenced Kim Dong-chul to 10 years of hard labor. The men were able to walk onto the plane without assistance, according to the White House.
South Korean spokesman Yoon Young-chan said the release of the Americans would have a “positive effect” on negotiations at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Kim. Yoon also called for the release of six South Koreans detained in North Korea.
The North Korean official who said Kim had granted the mens’ release reportedly told Pompeo, “You should [take] care that they do not make the same mistake again. This was a hard decision,” according to Reuters.
On Wednesday, the state-run North Korean news outlet said, “The U.S. is persistently clinging to the hostile policy toward [North Korea], misleading the public opinion. Such behavior may result in endangering the security of its own country.”
About 120,000 people are estimated to be imprisoned in North Korea without due process, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. These were the last of the American detainees, Reuters reported. Last year, North Korea released Otto Warmbier, 22, after holding him for 17 months. He was in a coma when released, and died within days.

33397,2018-05-09,Armenian parliament elects Nikol Pashinyan as prime minister,"On Tuesday, Armenia’s National Assembly voted 59-42 to elect opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan as the country’s prime minister. Armenian President Armen Sarkissian signed the decree appointing Pashinyan, who leads the Civil Contract party and its coalition partners, to the position.
The election took place almost a week after the Armenian parliament initially voted to reject Pashinyan’s candidacy for prime minister. He called for demonstrations, and more than 30,000 people protested, blocking some transport routes to the capital of Yerevan and its airport. 
Former Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan resigned two weeks ago following earlier protests calling for his resignation. Pashinyan had called for those protests, saying Sargsyan “lacks legitimacy.” Pashinyan was then arrested and subsequently released.
Sargsyan had served as president for two five-year terms prior to the parliament voting him into the role of prime minister on April 17, before resigning on April 23. In 2015, Armenia voted to change its constitution to grant some of the roles of the president to the prime minister. Sargsyan’s Republican party holds a majority in parliament. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Pashinyan on the election result. Pashinyan has said he would maintain current relations with Moscow. Armenia was formerly part of the Soviet Union. 
Pashinyan’s plans 
After the vote, Pashinyan announced that on May 9 he would visit Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan under the control of ethnic Armenian forces since a six-year war ended in 1994. The new prime minister said the region’s self-declared government there must be a part of any talks to end the conflict. Pashinyan, in a speech to parliament before his election Tuesday, said his protest movement would lead to the “recognition of realizing the rights of Karabakh to self-determination.” 
Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Hikmet Hajiyev issued a statement saying “the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is currently occupied, has always been an integral part of Azerbaijan.”

33383,2018-05-09,Kim Jong-un meets with Xi Jinping in second China visit,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited President Xi Jinping in China on Monday and Tuesday to hold diplomatic talks. Kim flew to the Chinese city of Dalian and stayed for two days before returning to Pyongyang.
Kim and Xi discussed relations between their two countries as well as “major issues of common concern,” and Kim restated Pyongyang’s willingness to forgo its nuclear arsenal. It was the second meeting between the two leaders in the last two months. They met for the first time in late March, during Kim’s first known trip abroad since becoming leader of North Korea in 2011.
“It has been the DPRK’s (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) consistent and clear stand to achieve denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” Kim said, according to China’s state news agency Xinhua. Kim also said, “As long as relevant parties abolish their hostile policies and remove security threats against the DPRK, there is no need for the DPRK to be a nuclear state and denuclearization can be realized.”
Xi said, “China is willing to continue to work with all relevant parties and play an active role in comprehensively advancing the process of peaceful resolution of the peninsula issue through dialogue, and realizing long-term peace and stability in the region.”
Kim told Xi the denuclearization of the peninsula was North Korea’s “constant and clear position,” and was quoted as saying, “I hope to build mutual trust with the U.S. through dialogue.”
The meeting took place before a summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said the date and location of the summit is fixed but has yet to make details public.
According to the White House, Trump and Xi held a phone call on Tuesday morning in which they discussed developments on the Korean peninsula and Kim’s visit to China.     Trump and Xi agreed that sanctions on Pyongyang should be maintained until North Korea permanently dismantles its nuclear and missile programs, the White House said.

33572,2018-05-10,At least 47 dead after Kenyan dam breaks,"At least 47 people were killed from floodwaters after Kenya’s Patel dam broke on Wednesday evening near the town of Solai, local police reported. Solai is about 120 miles (190 km) northwest of the capital city of Nairobi. Children were among the dead. The Kenyan Red Cross said it had rescued at least 40 people. More than 2,000 people were left without homes, according to BBC. Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui said 450 homes had been flooded. The flood also knocked down power lines, a school and some buildings. 
The dam had been used by a farmer to irrigate a flower farm. Vinoj Kumar, general manager of the 3,500 acre Solai farm, told Reuters, “In the past two days the intensity of the rain was high and the water started coming down carrying boulders and roots which damaged the [dam] wall. The dam wall cracked and the water escaped.”
During the past two months, heavy rains have killed 132 people and destroyed more than 220,000 homes in Kenya, BBC reported. Last year, droughts led to millions of people requiring food aid in Kenya and surrounding countries. 
The owner of the broken dam owns two other reservoirs in the area. Kinyanjui said engineers had been sent to inspect three dams affected by rains.
Heavy rains are forecast for the area for at least the next two weeks, according to Reuters.

33569,2018-05-10,At least 23 killed after Israeli bombing of 70 Iranian targets in Syria,"On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets and surface-to-surface missiles struck at least 70 Iranian military sites in Syria, according to Israeli officials. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 people were killed in the attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel had destroyed “nearly all” of Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria. Syria said its air defenses had destroyed “a large part” of the incoming missiles. 
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said fighter jets had hit 70 Iranian military targets. Targets reportedly included intelligence sites, logistics headquarters for Iranian Quds Forces, Quds Force munition storage warehouses at Damascus International Airport, a military logistics compound in a town south of Damascus, a military compound north of Damascus, and observation and military posts in the Golan demilitarized zone. The IDF said it also attacked Syrian air defense systems after they fired on Israeli fighter jets.
Early Thursday morning, Iranian forces in Syria fired about 20 rockets at Israeli forces in the Golan Heights, according to the IDF. Israel said it intercepted four rockets and that the others fell in Syrian territory. Prior to the attacks on Thursday, Israel had bombed parts of southern Syria. In April, Israeli jets bombed an airbase in Syria, killing seven Iranian troops, BBC reported.
Iran has deployed hundreds of military advisors to Syria during the country’s civil war, and has trained thousands of militiamen in support of Syrian government forces, according to BBC.
After Thursday’s attacks, Lieberman said, “If there is rain on our side, there will be a flood on their side.” He added, “I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message.” He said Israel does not want a further escalation of attacks between it and Iranian forces.
A Syrian spokesman said Israeli missiles killed three people, and that a radar station and munitions depot had been destroyed. He said some air defense bases had been damaged. 
Russia said Israel had fired 60 missiles from fighter jets and 10 from the ground. It said more than half the missiles were shot down.
Mikhail Bogdanov, a Russian deputy foreign minister, called for “restraint from all parties,” according to Russian news agency Interfax. The White House condemned Wednesday’s Iranian attack and said it supported Israel’s “right to act in self-defense.”

33539,2018-05-10,Trump to meet Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump tweeted that his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is planned for June 12 in Singapore. Trump said, “We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!” Earlier on Thursday, Trump met three Americans who were released from North Korea yesterday and had arrived at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington.

After they arrived, one of the former detainees, Kim Dong-chul, said, “we are very, very happy. We were treated in many different ways. For me, I had to do a lot of labor. But when I got sick I was also treated by them.” Kim Dong-chul is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced in North Korea to 10 years of hard labor for alleged espionage. 
The three former detainees had released a statement earlier expressing “deep appreciation” to Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the people and government of the U.S. for their return.

33512,2018-05-10,Lawyer alleges Cohen ‘selling access’ to Trump; Cohen says report inaccurate,"Michael Avenatti, attorney for Stephanie Clifford, said on Wednesday that Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen “appears to be selling access to the president.” Avenatti released a seven-page report on Tuesday that alleged more than $4.4 million had been paid by various entities to Cohen’s company, Essential Consultants, since its creation in October 2016. Cohen said on Wednesday that Avenatti’s report was inaccurate. 
Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, used the company to pay adult film actress Clifford, also known as “Stormy Daniels,” $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding an alleged affair she had with Donald Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the affair. Avenatti is representing Clifford in two lawsuits against Cohen and Trump for defamation.
Cohen, who is under investigation by the FBI, has not been charged with a crime. Cohen’s lawyer said Cohen has not done anything improper, ABC News reported.
The report from Avenatti and Associates alleged that Novartis AG, a global healthcare company, paid a total of about $400,000 to Essential Consultants. Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis AG, said his company paid Essential Consultants a total of $1.2 million over a year under a contract from February 2017 to February 2018. 
Althoff said Cohen “promised access to the new administration.” Novartis said it determined after a meeting with Cohen in March 2017 that he “would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated related to U.S. healthcare policy matters.” Novartis said the contract “unfortunately could only be terminated for cause,” such as for a default or a “material breach” on the terms of the agreement, so the company made payments until the contract expired. 
Novartis said Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team contacted the company in November of last year and it “cooperated fully” and “provided all the information requested.” Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and “related matters.”
Avenatti’s document also alleges that Columbus Nova LLC, an investment firm, paid a total of about $500,000 to Essential Consultants from January to August 2017. Columbus Nova is a U.S. affiliate of Renova Group, founded by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian that Avenatti alleges has an estimated worth of $13 billion. Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, is CEO of Columbus Nova. 
Columbus Nova said it is “solely owned and operated by Americans” and that it paid Cohen’s company for consulting on potential real estate investments and sources of capital. An attorney for Columbus Nova said the “claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved in or provided any funding for Columbus Nova’s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue.” Avenatti said, “We have significant evidence to the contrary. We haven’t released all the evidence that we have.” Mueller’s team has questioned Vekselberg, according to The New York Times.
Also in Avenatti’s report are allegations that Korea Aerospace Industries, Ltd. (KAI) paid $150,000 to Essential Consultants last November. KAI said Wednesday it had paid Essential Consultants $150,000 for “advice on local accounting standards.”

33516,2018-05-10,"Opposition coalition wins Malaysian general election, projections say","Malaysian opposition leader Mahathir Mohamad’s coalition won the most seats in Wednesday’s federal election, according to results published in Malaysia’s state-run newspaper Bernama and cited by The New York Times. Mahathir, leader of the Pakatan Harapan (PH), or Alliance of Hope, said his coalition had enough seats for a majority. The Malaysian Election Committee has yet to confirm the final results of the election. The committee said ballots for 176 of 222 parliamentary seats have been counted, with Mahathir’s PH party winning 90, Al Jazeera reported.
If the election committee confirms Mahathir’s party has won a 112-seat majority needed to form a government and select the prime minister, it would be the first time since 1957 that a party outside of the current ruling party, Barisan Nasional (BN), has ruled the federal government.
At 92 years of age, Mahathir, who served in the role of prime minister from 1981 to 2003, had been in political retirement for the past 14 years. He left the BN party to represent the opposition PH party and run against current Prime Minister Najib Razak, The New York Times reported, after Najib was accused of financial wrongdoing.
In a complaint filed in June of last year, the U.S. Justice Department claimed that Malaysian officials misappropriated $4.5 billion dollars, including $731 million dollars that were deposited in bank accounts belonging to Najib. Countries aside from the U.S. are also investigating the allegations, according to the New York Times.
Najib has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the accusations and Malaysian officials have said there is no evidence to support the Justice Department’s claims.
Malaysian parliamentary system
Malaysia, a former British colony in Southeast Asia, gained its independence in 1957 and established a constitutional monarchy. Under the country’s parliamentary system, there are two houses of government: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Members of the House of Representatives are decided through a general election every five years. The country is split into 222 separate districts, with each district electing one individual based on a majority vote to be their House representative.
The prime minister is not directly elected. Instead, the party or coalition with a simple majority in the House (112 of the 222 seats) selects a prime minister after the election. The prime minister runs Malaysia’s federal government.

33482,2018-05-10,CIA director nominee Haspel says she ‘will not restart’ interrogation program,"Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s nominee for CIA director, said that under her leadership the CIA would “not restart” the detention and interrogation program that at one time included techniques such as waterboarding. Haspel made the statement while answering questions from Senate Intelligence Committee members on Wednesday in an approximately 2 1/2 hour open nomination hearing, before answering questions in a closed session. 
In her opening statement, Haspel mentioned “challenges” the U.S. faces, including from terrorist groups and “a nuclear threat against the continental” U.S. “from a rogue state.” She also spoke about “challenges” from Iran, Russia and China.
 
 “I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that is immoral, even if it is technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it. I believe CIA must undertake activities that are consistent with American values,” Haspel said during the public hearing.
“I don’t believe that torture works,” Haspel said. “We got valuable information from debriefing of al-Qaeda detainees. I don’t think it’s knowable whether interrogation techniques played a role in that.” 
When asked about videotapes of interrogations that her boss at the CIA, Jose Rodriguez, had ordered destroyed in 2005, she said she “absolutely” supported destroying them. She said the reason for doing so was that there “was a great deal of concern about the security risk” to the CIA officers shown in the tapes.
Jack Reed (D-R.I.) asked if Haspel would make a pledge of loyalty to Trump if he asked her for one. Haspel said, “my only loyalty is to the American people and the constitution of the United States.”
Prior to the hearing, Haspel provided more than 100 written answers to questions presented to her by committee members. 
 
The confirmation hearing was interrupted at least once by a protester, whom security removed from the building.
 
 Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Tuesday that the committee may vote next week on its recommendation to the Senate on Haspel’s nomination, prior to the full Senate’s vote.
 
 Haspel, the deputy director of the CIA, has been acting director of the agency since former director Mike Pompeo left to become secretary of state. She started working with the CIA in 1985.

The primaries were to determine final candidates for the November midterm elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia held primaries for one Senate seat each, and Ohio held a primary for governor. 
The U.S. Senate currently has 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats and two Independents. The U.S. House has 236 Republicans, 193 Democrats and six vacancies.

North Carolina
In North Carolina, where 13 House seats will be voted on in the general election, three incumbent Democrats and nine incumbent Republicans were projected to win their parties’ candidacies. Incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger (R) was defeated 48.5 percent to 46.2 percent by Mark Harris (R). He was the sole incumbent defeated in Tuesday’s congressional primaries. 
One of the districts with a Republican incumbent did not hold a Democratic primary to select an opponent for the general election.
The Libertarian party held primaries for five of the House 13 seats, and four out of five of those primaries were uncontested. 
Ohio
In Ohio, the projected candidates to replace outgoing Governor John Kasich (R) were former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray (D) and Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine (R).

33680,2018-05-11,Former Congressman Reynolds sentenced for not reporting income on tax returns,"Former U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-Ill.) was sentenced on Thursday to six months in prison for failing to report income from consulting work in Africa on his tax returns from 2009 to 2012, according to prosecutors. Reynolds, who acted as his own attorney, admitted guilt and asked for a year of probation, The Associated Press reported. 
Reynolds has already spent two months in prison, which will count towards his six-month sentence, according to a prosecutors’ spokesperson. The maximum sentence he could have received was four years in prison, and prosecutors had asked for at least two years.
Reynolds was accused of not reporting nearly half a million in income to the IRS for consulting work performed in Africa on behalf of two Chicago businessmen. Reynolds said the money was for travel and expenses, didn’t need to be reported as income, according to the Chicago Tribune. 
U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman sentenced Reynolds, saying the time in prison “will give you some time to think where you go from here.” Reynolds, an African American, had told the judge putting him in jail wouldn’t teach him “a lesson” because he has “been taught about this racist society” already. After his hearing, Reynolds told reporters outside the court that after his sentence he planned to go “home to Africa.”
Reynolds, a 66-year-old Harvard graduate who has served in the military, was elected to Congress in 1992, representing Illinois's 2nd Congressional District. He resigned in 1995 after being convicted of sexual assault and child pornography charges. Reynolds had engaged in a relationship with a campaign worker who was 16 years old. In 1997, he was convicted on unrelated charges of bank fraud and misusing campaign funds. He was released from prison in 2001.
Update: This post has been updated to clarify that Reynolds failed to report income on tax returns he filed.

33602,2018-05-11,White Yale student calls police on black student who slept in dorm common room,"At about 1:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday, a white female graduate student at Yale University called the police to report a black female sleeping in the common room of her dormitory. Sarah Braasch, 43, a graduate student in philosophy, called the police on Lolade Siyonbola, 34, a graduate student in African studies. Siyonbola said she was working on a paper and fell asleep. She said Braasch came in and said, “You’re not supposed to be sleeping here. I’m going to call the police.”
Siyonbola posted two videos to Facebook: the first was 54 seconds long and showed an interaction with Braasch; the second video was about 17 minutes long and showed Siyonbola’s interaction with campus police. In the first video, Braasch tells Siyonbola, “I have every right to call the police. You cannot sleep in that room.” Siyonbola posted the second video at 1:56 a.m. local time on Tuesday, and it had 1.1 million views as of 7:30 p.m. local time on Thursday. 
The second video shows police asking Siyonbola for her student ID, which she did not provide at first. She used a key to show police she could open her dorm room, and the officers asked her again for her ID. One of the officers said, ”You're in a Yale building and we need to make sure that you belong here.” Siyonbola handed her ID to one of the officers, who then called dispatch to check the ID. It took about 14 minutes to verify that Siyonbola was a student at Yale since the name on her ID did not exactly match her name in university records. Yale said it allows students to put their “preferred names” on ID cards. After verifying that Siyonbola was a student, police let her go.
In her video, Siyonbola referred to a friend of hers on whom Braasch had previously called the police. Reneson Jean-Louis, a black graduate student, said Braasch called the police on him about a month ago. He said Braasch said during the incident, “You’re making me uncomfortable. I don't feel safe around you. You're an intruder. You need to leave, you need to get out.”
Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins said police told Braasch that Siyonbola was an “authorized resident who had every right to be there” after they spoke with her. He said police also told Braasch “that this was not a police matter” and they would report the incident to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Yale’s response
On Wednesday, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said the university believes campus police “followed procedures.” He said the university would, as it does with every incident, review the police response to “ensure” the “proper protocol” was followed, and to determine if there was anything “we could have done better.” 
Yale said campus police ""are trained on unconscious bias, de-escalation techniques, and problem solving, and seek to treat each individual with respect.”
On Tuesday, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Lynn Cooley said the university had “continued work” to do to make Yale a “truly inclusive place.” She said she was committed with the university to “redoubling our efforts to build a supportive community in which all graduate students are empowered in their intellectual pursuits and professional goals within a welcoming environment.” She said an “essential part” of those efforts was “a commitment to mutual respect and an open dialog.”
Yale’s Vice President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews said she was “deeply troubled” by the incident, and that she and Dr. Cooley would hold “listening sessions” in which students could voice their views and concerns regarding the incident in the coming days. Goff-Crews said, “This incident and others recently reported to me underscore that we have work to do to make Yale not only excellent but also inclusive.”
Siyonbola’s response
Regarding Goff-Crews’ statement, Siyonbola reportedly said, “It wasn’t compassionate. It was very high-level — like we have to do better someday, somehow.”
On Tuesday, Siyonbola posted a message on Facebook, saying, ""Grateful for all the love, kind words and prayers, your support has been overwhelming. Black Yale community is beyond incredible and is taking good care of me. I know this incident is a drop in the bucket of trauma Black folk have endured since Day 1 America, and you all have stories. Share below if you feel led.""
Siyonbola founded the Yoruba Cultural Institute in Brooklyn, New York. She has written a book on African history and diaspora migration.

33714,2018-05-12,Trump announces plan to reduce drug prices,"President Donald Trump announced his administration’s plans to lower prescription drug prices, during a speech in the White House Rose Garden on Friday. Trump said the plan seeks to encourage innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, promote drug price competition, incentivize drugmakers to lower prices, and remove federal rules that may contribute to higher drug prices. 
Trump said “medicine that costs a few dollars in a foreign country” and “hundreds of dollars in America” was an “injustice.” He directed the U.S. Trade Representative to make this topic a priority during trade discussions with other countries, including addressing intellectual property and market access policies, the president announced.
The White House released a 44-page blueprint of its “American Patients First” plan on Friday, which Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said includes more than 50 actions that the administration has either implemented or proposed to reduce prices.
Actions already taken to reduce drug prices, according to the blueprint, include:

	The Food  and
	Requiring drug rebates to be shared with patients in the Medicare Part D program.

The Department of Health and Human Services is seeking public feedback on a selection of the potential actions outlined in the blueprint.

33707,2018-05-12,Iran ‘condemns’ Israel's strikes on Iranian targets in Syria,"Iran “strongly condemns” an Israeli attack on targets in Syria Thursday, calling them a “blatant violation of Syria's sovereignty,” foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Friday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out airstrikes on at least 70 Iranian targets in Syria on Thursday in response to what it said was Iran’s Quds Force launching 20 rockets towards Israel’s front defensive line in Golan Heights early that day. Iran has not directly confirmed or denied firing the rockets, though it said Israel’s airstrikes were founded on “baseless pretexts.”
Most of the Golan Heights territory, internationally recognized as part of Syria, has been occupied by Israel since 1967, and later annexed. Thursday’s airstrikes were the largest attack Israel has carried out on Syrian territory since the start of the Syrian war in 2011, according to BBC. IDF Spokesman Brig.-Gen. Ronen Manelis said Russia was informed of the strikes in advance. 
Iran, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government in the war, has deployed hundreds of troops in Syria. Qasemi said Friday Israel’s attacks on Syrian soil go “against all international conventions,” and said Israel “cannot stand peace and stability in the region” and tries to make itself safe by “making the region all the more unstable.”
Israel said there were no injuries from the rockets reportedly launched by Iran shortly after midnight on Thursday morning. All of the targets struck by the Israeli airstrikes in response were Quds Force sites, the IDF said. 
Syrian state news outlet SANA reported Syrian air defenses shot down “scores of missiles and prevent[ed] most of them from reaching their targets.” SANA also reported that the Israeli strikes killed three people and injured two, according to The Jerusalem Post. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 people were killed in the strikes.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the Israeli strikes were a “consequence” of Iran crossing “a red line,” adding that the country would “not allow Iran to entrench itself in Syria.” He noted, “our action is directed against Iranian targets in Syria. However, if the Syrian military acts against us, we will act against it.”
Recent developments with Iran nuclear agreement
This week, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which international sanctions were removed from Iran in exchange for limits to its nuclear program. Trump announced the U.S. would reintroduce sanctions on Iran. Netanyahu had earlier  claimed Iran “lied” when it said it didn’t have a nuclear weapons program, and Israel supported the U.S. withdrawal.
In a statement on Friday, Iran said it was preparing to pursue uranium enrichment in case the nuclear deal ends. Iran is “taking all necessary steps in preparation for Iran to pursue industrial-scale enrichment without any restrictions, using the results of the latest research and development of Iran's brave nuclear scientists,” Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said. The U.K., France and Germany said they still support the deal.

33878,2018-05-13,"Xerox ends Fujifilm merger agreement, reaches settlement deal","Printer and copier company Xerox Corporation has ended an agreement to merge with Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings and is entering a settlement deal with investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. The merger was part of a restructuring that would, along with other measures, save $1.7 billion per year by 2022. Xerox also announced that Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson had resigned, and that John Visentin would assume the role. Xerox also replaced five directors as part of changes to its board.
The two companies had publicized earlier this year that Fuji Xerox, their 56-year-old joint venture, would combine with Xerox. Fuji Xerox would then take a 50.1 percent stake in the newfound company, New Fuji Xerox.
Xerox said earlier this month it was seeking better terms for a proposed merger with Fujifilm. Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox, said the merger plan “undervalued” Xerox, according to Reuters.
Xerox said it was ending the deal with Fuji Xerox partly because Fujifilm did not present audited financial information for Fuji Xerox by a mid-April deadline. Xerox also stated that there were “material deviations” between audited financial statements from Fuji Xerox and unaudited statements from prior submissions.
Xerox’s new board members are Jonathan Christodoro, Keith Cozza, Nicholas Graziano, Scott Letier and John Visentin. The outgoing directors are William Curt Hunter, Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese and Stephen H. Rusckowski. Xerox said in a statement that its new board would meet in short order and “begin a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.”
Regarding the settlement with Xerox, Icahn said, “We are extremely pleased that Xerox finally terminated” its decision to “cede control of the company to Fujifilm.” He added, “We have often said that the most important person at a company (by far) is the CEO. We are therefore also pleased that John Visentin, a tried and true veteran in this area, will be taking the helm.”

33983,2018-05-14,US Supreme Court rules to allow states to legalize sports betting,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 on Monday in favor of New Jersey to invalidate a federal law that prohibited states from legalizing and regulating sports betting. The invalidated legislation, the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992, had made the majority of sports gambling illegal outside of Nevada. The Supreme Court ruled that PASPA violates the Constitution’s 10th Amendment on powers reserved by the states from the federal government.
PASPA and background
Except in cases where specific types of sports gambling were already legal in a state during a certain time period, PASPA made it illegal for states to “sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize” sports betting. Sports gambling in Nevada, as well as more restricted sports betting such as lotteries in Montana, Delaware and Oregon, were allowed to continue under the law.
In 2014, New Jersey passed a law to repeal some provisions of its prohibitions on sports gambling at racetracks and casinos, after a 2011 gambling law was overturned in court. The National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) challenged the 2014 law and a lower court ruled against the state. Then Governor Chris Christie took the case, Christie vs. NCAA, to the Supreme Court. The case was later renamed Murphy vs. NCAA after Phil Murphy became the governor. New Jersey was joined in the lawsuit by 18 other states.
The NCAA and professional sports leagues such as the NFL and NBA had argued in favor of keeping PASPA. With legal sports gambling in more states, these sports organizations may incur additional expenses for the education of players, monitoring of betting trends for any suspect activity, and investigations, according to The Washington Post. The NFL said in a statement, “Congress has long-recognized the potential harms posed by sports betting to the integrity of sporting contests and the public confidence in these events.” The organization said it would work to “protect our fans and the integrity of our game” in any states that legalize sports gambling.
Supreme Court Ruling
In the majority opinion for the court, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, referencing the 10th Amendment: “The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own.” He also wrote that “Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures.”
The 10th Amendment says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.”
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissenting opinion that the majority decision “wields an ax to cut down” the law “instead of using a scalpel to trim” it. She favored rewriting the PASPA to no longer prohibit certain state laws as it does now, and instead ban states and private parties from sponsoring sports gambling regardless of what the state laws were.
Response
New Jersey and West Virginia have passed legislation that allows sports gambling, according to The Washington Post. In New Jersey, Monmouth Park racetrack said it could open windows for sports betting within two weeks.
DraftKings, a fantasy sports site, said Monday that it would “enter the sports betting market” and would work with states that passed legislation authorizing sports gambling to apply for licenses to do so.
Former Gov. Christie, who initiated the suit, tweeted that it was “great day for the rights of states and their people to make their own decisions.”
A study by University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) found that there was about $5 billion in legal sports betting in Nevada last year, with $1.76 billion of that from college and professional football.

33980,2018-05-14,"60 Palestinian protesters killed, 2,700 wounded by Israeli forces","Israeli forces killed 60 Palestinians and injured 2,700 during protests along the Gaza border with Israel on Monday, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials. The protests, which were a continuation of ongoing demonstrations over the past six weeks, coincided with the U.S. opening its embassy in Jerusalem on Monday.
Israeli forces fired live ammunition as well as tear gas and firebombs at Gaza protesters. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 800 of the injuries were from tear gas. There were no reports of Israeli soldiers killed. At least one Israeli was wounded by shrapnel, according to Colonel Conricus, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Israel said that 24 of the 60 who were killed on Monday were “militants.”
About 40,000 Palestinians participated in what Israel described as “violent riots” at 13 locations along the security fence in Gaza. Palestinians threw stones, and flew kites that were on fire into Israel, according to the Israeli military. Other protesters demonstrated peacefully.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced three days of mourning after the protesters' deaths.
The Palestinians in Gaza were continuing protests that started on March 30 and called for the “right to return” to Israel for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted the right to return.
International responses
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “The Hamas terrorist organization declares its intention to destroy Israel and sends thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal. We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and our citizens.” Hamas is a political organization with an armed division that rules the Gaza territories. Israel and the U.S. have described it as a terrorist organization. 
White House spokesman Raj Shah said, “The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response.” He added, “Israel has the right to defend itself.”
The EU’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called for Israeli forces to restrain from violence, as did the U.K. French President Emmanuel Macron said, “France is condemning the violence.” 
A German foreign ministry spokeswoman said, “Israel has the right to defend itself and secure its (border) fence against violent intrusions, but the principle of proportionality applies.” The spokeswoman said that meant only using live ammunition when other forms of deterrence had been unsuccessful against specific threats. 
Turkey and South Africa recalled their ambassadors to Israel, with Turkey recalling its ambassador to the U.S. as well.
The U.N. said, “those responsible for outrageous human rights violations must be held to account.”
More demonstrations are planned in Gaza for Tuesday.
West Bank protests
There were also protests in the West Bank over the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. Part of Jerusalem is located in the West Bank; Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed it in 1980. The annex is not recognized under international law and Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state. Israel wants all of Jerusalem to be its capital.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced last December that the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Palestinians held protests after his announcement.
Abbas said of the U.S. embassy opening, “It is a settlement, not an embassy. A U.S. settlement in East Jerusalem.”
Trump said in a recorded message at the embassy opening ceremony that the U.S. “remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement.”

33996,2018-05-14,"Florida prom has caged tiger, other wild animals on display","A Florida high school held a prom with a “Welcome to the Jungle” theme  on Friday. Christopher Columbus High School paid a wildlife facility to bring a fox, a lemur, at least one macaw and a caged tiger to the event. The sister of a student at the school posted videos on Facebook of the tiger walking back and forth in its cage, and alleged that it was animal “cruelty” and “abuse,” and added that it was the “fault” of the high school staff. News media reported on the incident, and on Monday the school apologized and said the decision to have wild animals at its prom did not reflect its “values.”
Mari-Cris Castellanos, 19, posted three videos sent to her by her brother, whom she said paid $200 to attend the prom. The prom, held at the DoubleTree by Hilton Miami Airport  Convention Center, included music, drumming, spotlights and torch dancers. One video showed the tiger walking back and forth in its cage, and another showed the tiger lying down, facing away from the torch dancers. Castellanos referred to the event as “shameful,” and called for a ban on animal entertainment at schools. 
Ron Magill, a spokesman for Zoo Miami, watched the video and said that when the tiger’s tail was “slashing back and forth” and its ears were in “helicopter mode,” or what he describes as either sticking out to the side or flat back, that it was an indication the tiger “is being stressed out.” 
The school said over the weekend, “The tiger, which was displayed for a few minutes in a cage, was never harmed or in danger, was not forced to perform, was always accompanied by his handlers. And for the great majority of the time was lying down in a relaxed state facing away from the audience.” There were two Miami-Dade police officers present at the event, the school added.
The school’s principal, David Pugh, later said, “we regret the decision to have had live animals at our prom,” and that it “in no way reflects” the school’s values. “We recognize this decision has offended some, and for that we apologize,” Pugh said. “We will immediately evaluate our current policies and procedures regarding all school activities and events.” 
Florida wildlife laws
Under Florida law, tigers, considered a Class I animal, are not permitted to be owned for personal use. They may be captive for purposes of public display or sale with a special permit from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and must be given “humane treatment” and kept in “sanitary surroundings.”
The wildlife commission said it was “looking into the incident to determine if any violation of Florida’s captive wildlife rules took place.” It said, “exhibition of wildlife at public events is not prohibited by Florida law.”
Public contact with Class I animals must “be limited as to frequency, intensity, and duration so that such handling will not adversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of the animals, nor expose the public to injury,” according to Florida law.
Predators Unlimited, the licensed wildlife facility in Florida that provided the tiger, has valid permits for exhibition of a range of wild animals, according to the commission.
The manager of another company that provides wild animals for events, Pirates for Parties, said tiger appearances generally cost about $5,000 to $6,000.

33872,2018-05-14,US embassy opens in Jerusalem,"The U.S. held an opening ceremony for its new embassy in Jerusalem at 4 p.m. local time on Monday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel. About 800 people were expected to attend the event, including an American delegation whose members include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, presidential senior advisors Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and some foreign officials. President Donald Trump announced last December that the U.S. would relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Speaking at a celebratory event on the ministry grounds on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “President Trump is making history. Our people will be eternally grateful for his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.” About 1,000 guests attended the event, among whom was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.
Some ambassadors from countries that oppose the U.S. embassy move said they would not attend the opening ceremony. Ayman Odeh, leader of the Arab faction in Israel’s parliament, said, “This one-sided move strengthens Israel’s occupation and takes us further from peace.”
The U.S. repurposed another consular facility for the new embassy. Given the building is not large enough for all U.S. consular staff, some officials will commute back and forth from Tel Aviv. The two cities are about 44 miles (70 km) apart.
The U.S. is the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognize the city as the capital of Israel. Palestinians held protests after Trump announced the move. The Czech Republic, Guatemala, Paraguay and Romania later announced they will also move their embassies to Jerusalem, according to Egypt Today and The Times of Israel. 
On Sunday, Israelis also commemorated the “reunification” of Jerusalem after Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967. The annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel is not recognized internationally.
More than 1,000 Israeli police officers were working with U.S. officials to provide security for the embassy opening, according to an Israeli police spokesman. Palestinians have planned protests against the embassy opening in different parts of Palestinian territories.
Palestinians have been protesting in Gaza since March 30. They have called for the return of Palestinians to areas of Israel where they or their ancestors lived prior to the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israeli snipers have killed at least 49 Palestinians and wounded more than 2,200 since the protests began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. 
Tuesday is Nakba Day, recognizing the approximately 750,000 people who left their homes in the violence leading up to and during the 1948 war. More than 70 percent of Palestinians who live in Gaza are refugees from Israel or descendants of refugees, according to The Washington Post. The U.N. has endorsed their right to return to Israel.
Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005, and restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza.

33876,2018-05-14,Lava erupts from new fissures at Hawaii volcano; nearby residents ordered to evacuate,"Three new fissures opened on Hawaii’s Big Island over the weekend, bringing the total number of fissures to 18 since the Kilauea volcano erupted on May 3. Police and the Department of Public Works said the 18th fissure opened on Hale Kamahina Loop Road on Sunday, and was emitting steam and spattering lava. Residents near the road were ordered to evacuate, adding to the nearly 2,000 people who had already been evacuated since the original eruption.
The 17th fissure was reported Saturday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (USGS).
Another fissure, the 16th, was reported earlier Saturday. It “produced a lava flow that traveled about 250 yards before stalling,” officials said. That fissure was about a mile east of the Puna Geothermal Venture plant, where officials removed 60,000 gallons of flammable liquids due to safety concerns.
USGS officials said that an explosive eruption is possible at the Halemaumau crater, which is atop the Kilauea volcano. “We still have a highly active volcano here at Kilauea,” said Tina Neal, USGS scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. “The situation remains unstable. Additional outbreaks of lava are likely.”
President Trump declared a major disaster on the Big Island on Friday. The declaration allows federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in areas affected by the Kilauea volcanic eruption.
The estimated cost to protect residents over the next 30 days is expected to exceed $2.9 million, according to the Hawaiian governor's office.

33874,2018-05-14,Family of suicide bombers attacks 3 Indonesian churches,"At least 10 people were killed and dozens hospitalized after a family of suicide bombers attacked three Christian churches in Muslim-majority Indonesia on Sunday morning, CNN reported. The attacks occurred in Surabaya, a port city on the east coast of Java Island. The family of six, which included two children and two teens, targeted the Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church, the Pentecost Central Church and the Santa Maria Catholic Church. Police have closed off the three churches as they investigate the incidents.
At about 7:30 a.m. local time, the family’s two sons — aged 16 and 18 — rode motorcycles into Santa Maria Catholic Church and detonated explosives they were carrying. Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said the next blasts went off at 7:35 a.m. and 8 a.m. BBC reported that the final two attacks occurred in five-minute increments following the first. The mother and her two daughters — aged 9 and 12 — detonated explosives they were carrying at Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church. The father drove a bomb-laden car into the grounds of Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church. The latter two attacks occurred sequentially. Media outlets reported inconsistencies in the timeline of events.
Four people died in the explosion at the Santa Maria Catholic Church, while two people were killed at each of the final two attacks. Two people later died at a hospital. Sunday’s bombing is the deadliest in Indonesia since 2005, when 22 people were killed on the island of Sulawesi.
Police Chief Tito Karnavian said the family belonged to an Indonesian Islamic State-inspired network, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). IS’ Amaq News Agency described the bombings as “martyrdom attacks” and claimed responsibility for them. Neither IS nor security sources have provided proof to substantiate the claim.
Also on Sunday, police said they killed four suspected members of JAD in Cianjur, West Java, and arrested two others.
Responses to the attacks
Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi tweeted her condolences to the bombing victims, writing, “Deepest condolences to the victims and families of the bombing victims in Surabaya.”
During his weekly Sunday audience in St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis reportedly said, “Together we invoke the God of peace to cease these violent actions, and in the heart of all find space not for hatred and violence but for reconciliation and fraternity.”
The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta issued a statement condemning the attacks: “These attacks on peaceful worshipers are an affront to the tolerance and diversity embraced by Indonesians. The United States stands with the people of Indonesia, and we offer our deepest condolences to the families of the victims.”
Past attacks in Indonesia
IS has executed previous attacks in Indonesia. Last May, two suicide bombers attacked a bus station in the capital of Jakarta. In 2016, IS claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing and shooting also in Jakarta.
Jihadist attacks have also taken place in Indonesia before IS emerged. In 2002, al-Qaeda-linked bombings killed over 200 people.

33870,2018-05-14,"2 dead, 4 injured after knife attack in Paris","On Saturday night in Paris, a man attacked several people with a knife, killing one person and injuring four. The attacker was shot dead by police after they attempted to stop him with a stun gun, according to an official from the union for French police officers. The attack took place at about 9 p.m. local time, north of the Seine River in a neighborhood near the Paris Opera, French police said. During the attack, the suspect reportedly yelled “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is Great,” according to Paris prosecutor François Molins. The prosecutor added that authorities have begun a terrorism investigation.
The Islamic State (IS) group’s media outlet, Amaq News Agency, said the attacker was a “soldier of the Islamic State.” French authorities have not confirmed that IS is responsible, CNN reported.
The New York Times reported that a judicial source said the attacker was a naturalized French citizen born in 1997 in the Russian republic of Chechnya. He was identified by police as Khamzat Azimov, AFP reported. The man’s parents were taken into custody for questioning, according to a New York Times source.
French Interior Minister Gérard Collomb said the deceased was a 29-year old man, and that the four others injured in the attack do not have life-threatening injuries. The injured include a 34-year old man and a 54-year old woman who were seriously hurt, and a 26-year old woman and a 31-year old man who were slightly wounded, according to AFP.
Responses from French leaders:

33865,2018-05-14,Pulitzer board to investigate misconduct allegations against author Junot Díaz,"The Pulitzer Prize board said on Thursday it would investigate sexual misconduct allegations against its former chairman, Dominican-American author Junot Díaz. Author Zinzi Clemmons alleged that Díaz forcibly kissed her six years ago at a literature workshop when she was a graduate student. Two other female authors characterized comments Díaz had made to them as “misogynist” and “verbal violence.” Díaz said he takes “responsibility” for his past. The board said Díaz “welcomed” its investigation and would “cooperate fully” with it.
The Pulitzer Prize board elected Junot Díaz, 49, as its chairman in April. He has resigned from that position and will remain on the board, according to Pulitzer. 
Díaz won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction in 2008 for his novel “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.” He has also written some collections of short stories, including “Drown” and “This Is How You Lose Her.” He is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The allegations
In an article last month in The New Yorker, Díaz told the story of his rape as an 8-year old boy by a “grownup” that he “truly trusted.” At a Sydney Writers’ Festival session on May 4, Clemmons addressed Díaz during a question and answer session. Buzzfeed interviewed audience member Abby Callard after the event. According to Callard, Clemmons said some people said Díaz’s New Yorker article was a way to pre-empt sexual misconduct accusations that may come against him. Clemmons then said Díaz had spoken at Columbia University six years ago and asked him ""why you treated me that way,” according to Callard. Witnesses told Buzzfeed that Clemmons left before Díaz had answered and that he had asked her to stay. 
Clemmons later tweeted, “As a grad student, I invited Junot Díaz to speak to a workshop on issues of representation in literature. I was an unknown wide-eyed 26 yo, and he used it as an opportunity to corner and forcibly kiss me. I'm far from the only one he's done this 2, I refuse to be silent anymore.” 
Clemmons also tweeted that she told “several” people her story at the time, and had emails Díaz had sent her afterward. She did not specify in her tweet the content of the emails.
Author Monica Byrne wrote about how she spoke with Díaz at a professional dinner, saying, “I made a point emphasizing how personal narrative is important in empowering the marginalized. He said (and this is my memory, so I’m not including quotation marks), Well, I don’t know if you know how statistics work, but that’s like saying, Oh, I haven’t been RAPED, so RAPE must not exist.” She added, “Díaz didn’t physically assault me. But shouting the word ‘rape’ in my face is absolutely verbal sexual assault.” She also said, “Verbal violence is a form of violence.”
Author Carmen Maria Machado tweeted that during one of Díaz’s book tours, she asked him a question and Díaz “went off for (sic) me for twenty minutes.” She characterized Díaz’s interaction with her as a “blast of misogynist rage and public humiliation.”
Díaz’s response
Díaz said, “I take responsibility for my past. That is the reason I made the decision to tell the truth of my rape and its damaging aftermath. This conversation is important and must continue. I am listening to and learning from women's stories in this essential and overdue cultural movement. We must continue to teach all men about consent and boundaries.""
Twitter responses to the allegations
Of the first 40 tweets that resulted from a search on Twitter on Saturday of “Junot Díaz,” six of them contain the words “misogyny” or “misogynist.” At least 37 out of 40 tweets could be characterized as negative or critical towards Díaz. One of the tweets that could be considered neutral was from a media outlet saying that Díaz had resigned as Pulitzer board chairman, and that Pulitzer had started an investigation. Some of the tweets that could be considered negative included:
Bleggs. @_Bleggy_ 2:28 AM - 4 May 2018: I wish the Junot Díaz thing surprised me. I really do.
abolish ice.  ⛈ @okaywowstop 3:22 AM - 4 May 2018: idk i'm pretty pissed about junot Díaz but it feels weird how all of these revelations are met with people being like ‘[D@MNIT] NOW I HAVE TO HATE THIS GUY’ instead of ‘WOW THAT'S [F@%KED] UP AND I FEEL FOR HIS VICTIMS’ 😬
Intersectional Papi @JulianThePoet 12:18 PM - 4 May 2018: I believe the women speaking their truth about Junot Díaz this morning.  Period. I ask that alongside that we move against any rhetoric that aims to undermine the credibility and experiences of male survivors of sexual violence. Period. I have faith we can do both.
Kat Rosenfield @katrosenfield 8:10 AM - 6 May 2018: normal brain: hold Junot Díaz accountable for mistreating women. galaxy brain: hold Díaz accountable for how his fictional characters treat women. cosmic brain: hold random men accountable for how Díaz’s fictional characters treat women
One person also tweeted her personal experiences of Díaz, which she indicated were positive:

34078,2018-05-15,Putin drives across 12-mile Russia-Crimea bridge in opening ceremony,"Russian President Vladimir Putin drove a construction truck across a new 11.8-mile (19 km) bridge connecting Russia and Crimea as part of the bridge’s opening ceremony on Tuesday. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine, which considers the annexation illegal, said the bridge was “yet another piece of evidence of the Kremlin ignoring international law” and “an attempt to legitimize the temporary occupation of the Crimean peninsula.”
Putin spoke to construction workers after crossing the bridge, saying, “All the way back in the days of the czars, people dreamed that this bridge would be built. Thanks to your work, thanks to your talent, this project, this miracle has happened.”
Putin’s drive across the $3.6 billion bridge, built over two years, took about 20 minutes and was broadcast live on Russian television. He was followed by other construction vehicles.
The bridge spans the Kerch Strait, a waterway between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Ships from parts of Ukraine would have to be granted access by Russia to cross between the two seas, according to Newsweek. 
Ukraine’s government has filed a lawsuit with The Hague against Russia over the construction, saying Russia has violated the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea by building the bridge.
The U.S. and EU have imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. In 2014, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying the referendum in Crimea that approved Russia’s annexation of the peninsula “was not authorized by Ukraine” and had no validity. The General Assembly called upon U.N. states to not recognize the annexation. 
Authorities plan to open the bridge to cars on Wednesday. Trucks will not be permitted for several months, which will allow engineers to check the safety and quality of the bridge under car traffic, according to RT. A section of the bridge for trains is scheduled to be completed next year.
The construction company that built the bridge is owned by Arkady Rotenberg, who has known Putin since he was a child, according to The Associated Press.

34074,2018-05-15,North Korea suspends Wednesday meeting with South over military drills,"Early Wednesday morning local time, North Korea suspended talks with South Korea that were scheduled for later that day, citing South Korea-U.S. joint military drills. The North Korean state-run Central News Agency (KCNA) called the drills a “provocation” and alleged they were a preparation for an invasion of North Korea, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. In March, the U.S. said it would conduct the joint military drills with South Korea as it has done in previous years.
KCNA also said the U.S. would have to “undertake careful deliberations about the fate” of the planned meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump “in light of this provocative military” drill. That meeting is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore. 
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, “We have not heard anything” from the North and South Korea governments to “indicate that we would not continue conducting these [joint military] exercises or that we would not continue planning for our meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un next month.”
Wednesday’s meeting between the Koreas was to be a follow-up to the April 27 meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Following that meeting, the two leaders issued a document called the “Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula.” That document announced the countries had agreed to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a formal close to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953. Wednesday’s meeting had been scheduled to discuss these goals.
KCNA said, according to Yonhap, that the military exercise in South Korea “is a flagrant challenge to the Panmunjom Declaration and an intentional military provocation running counter to the positive political development on the Korean Peninsula.” 
The U.S. and South Koreans began conducting air combat drills with U.S. stealth fighters and B-52 bombers last Friday for a period scheduled to last for two weeks.

33993,2018-05-15,"Cleric al-Sadr leads Iraq elections, incumbent PM's coalition in third","Preliminary results from Iraq’s parliamentary elections show Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr’s coalition won the most votes in the general election on Saturday, according to the country’s electoral commission. Former Minister of Transport Hadi al-Amiri’s coalition is in second place and current Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s coalition is in third place. More than 91 percent of Saturday’s vote has been counted and the remaining votes are not expected to affect al-Sadr’s lead, Reuters reported. 
Voter turnout was 44 percent, the lowest since 2003 after Saddam Hussein was removed from power as part of a U.S.-led invasion. Saturday’s election was the first since Iraq announced it had retaken territories from the Islamic State (IS) and declared “victory” against the group in December of last year. (IS has since claimed responsibility for individual attacks.) It was the fourth election since Hussein’s removal. 
Top three coalitions
1. Al-Sadr leads the al-Sairoon Coalition (The Marchers), a combination of the Sadrist Movement and the Iraqi Communist Party. Al-Sadr does not support the influence of Iran or the United States in Iraqi politics, according to the Associated Press. 
2. Al-Amiri, a Shiite militia chief, leads the Fatah Coalition, which is in second place in the preliminary vote results. The Fatah Coalition is a combination of the Islamic Supreme Coalition of Iraq (ISCI) and the Popular Mobilization Units (PMUs) Shiite militia groups. Iran supports al-Amiri, according to Reuters.
3. Prime Minister al-Abadi leads the Nasr Coalition (Victory of Iraq). Al-Abadi is an ally of both Iran and the U.S., according to Reuters.
Al-Sadr is the son of the late Ayatollah Mohammad Sadq al-Sadr; ayatollahs are Shiite religious leaders. The younger Al-Sadr campaigned on a platform of anti-corruption, AP reported. He was a commander in the fight against IS, and prior to 2011, led a militia that fought U.S. forces. 
Iraq’s parliament has 329 seats and a party needs to win 165 seats to have a majority. Seats are allocated based on the final vote count. If no single party wins enough seats, a majority coalition may be formed.

34186,2018-05-16,MSU agrees to $500M settlement for patients in Nassar sexual misconduct case,"On Tuesday, Michigan State University (MSU) agreed in principal to pay a $500 million settlement for 332 women who accused sports doctor Larry Nassar of sexually abusing them. Under the agreement, $425 million, an average of $1.28 million each, would go to the women, and $75 million would go to a trust fund for any future claimants alleging Nassar sexually abused them while he was a doctor at MSU. The settlement has not been finalized.
The MSU Board of Trustees approved the agreement on Tuesday. The agreement only applied to MSU and to individuals associated with MSU. Lawsuits against USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and other parties are pending. No confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements were attached to the MSU settlement. 
Nassar had been a doctor for USA Gymnastics and a sports doctor at MSU. The school received a complaint about Nassar in 2014. It found no violations of its policies and allowed him to continue to work as a doctor at the school, with some restrictions on how he practiced medicine. In September 2016, MSU fired Nassar after media outlets reported allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct with his patients. 
A Michigan judge sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in jail for sexual misconduct in January of this year.
John Manly, an attorney for the claimants, said the settlement was the result of “the bravery of more than 300 women and girls who had the courage to stand up.” He called the agreement a “measure of justice and healing” and said the claimants “hope” that the “legacy of this settlement will be far reaching institutional reform that will end the threat of sexual assault in sports, schools and throughout our society.”
Brian Breslin, Chair of the MSU Board of Trustees, said in a statement that the board was “truly sorry” for what the claimants have “been through.” He called it a “fair resolution” and said, “We recognize the need for change on our campus and in our community around sexual assault awareness and prevention.”

34183,2018-05-16,"North Carolina teachers rally for higher pay, per-pupil spending","Teachers demonstrated in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Wednesday to ask for higher pay and more spending per pupil. About 19,000 people marched to the state legislature, according to the Downtown Raleigh Alliance. At least 42 school districts were closed and more than one million students were given the day off as districts could not find enough substitute teachers to fill in for teachers participating in the “March for Students and Rally for Respect.”
The North Carolina Association of Educators organized the event and has requested that teacher pay and per-pupil spending be increased to the national average within four years, calling for a delay on the state’s planned corporate tax reductions until this is achieved.
The average teacher pay in the state in 2018 is estimated to be about $51,000, ranking it 37th in the nation, about $9,600 below the national average. The amount the state spends per pupil is estimated to be $2,400 below the national average, ranking it 39th in the nation, according to the National Education Association. Using these numbers, the state would have to give teachers an average raise of about 19 percent above their state-budgeted salaries this year to achieve the national average for teacher pay.
The Republican-controlled state legislature held its first day of the legislative session on Wednesday, with demonstrating teachers in attendance. Teachers were planning to meet with lawmakers in the afternoon.
Republican legislative leaders said the state had increased teacher pay each of the last four years and planned an average raise of 6.2 percent this year. State Senate Leader Phil Berger and state House Speaker Tim Moore said they want to maintain corporate tax reductions that are currently planned and in the future would consider giving bonuses for higher performing teachers in place of raising teachers’ pay to the national average.
Some schools remained open Wednesday, and one of the teachers who was demonstrating, Kim Andrews, reportedly said teachers would go back to work on Thursday.
Teachers in other states have held walkouts or strikes this year for increased pay, benefits and education spending, including in Arizona, Kentucky, Oklahoma and West Virginia. West Virginia signed a bill to give teachers a 5 percent raise.

34179,2018-05-16,"Overpass collapse in India kills at least 18 people, injures more than 10","At least 18 people were killed and 10 injured when a overpass bridge collapsed and fell on at least six cars and a bus in Varanasi, India, on Tuesday evening. Construction of the 164 foot (50 m) long overpass had been partially completed in February, and some work was ongoing, according to Varanasi Commissioner Deepak Agarwal.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he was “saddened by the loss of lives” and that he had spoken to officials to ask them to “ensure all possible support to those affected.” Authorities called off rescue operations at 10 p.m. local time Tuesday, according to Sanjay Kumar, the Uttar Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority commissioner.
Police have opened an investigation into Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation, the public sector company that was building the overpass. The company will send a technical team to examine the cause of the collapse, the company said. Rajan Mittal, managing director of the company, said, “Preliminary findings point towards a loose cross-beam connection or a bearing failure. The beam may have [been] dislodged from its socket because of the thunderstorm and fell. So it may be a natural disaster.” 
Mittal said that at the time of the collapse, the company had completed 56 percent of the work on the bridge. He also said traffic should not have been allowed under the bridge while construction was ongoing and his company had written “several” letters to authorities to impose traffic restrictions. The company’s requests went “unheeded,” according to Mittal. 
The company is constructing 115 bridges and “flyovers” in the state, many with planned completion dates by the end of the year. Mittal said the company stopped all its construction work until safety norms at each site can be analyzed. He said all the company’s employees decided to donate a day’s pay to aid in the relief effort.
The state government is giving $7,600 (500,000 rupees) to families of those who died and $3,000 (200,000 rupees) to those injured in the incident.

34175,2018-05-16,"Senate committee approves Haspel’s nomination as CIA director, sends to full Senate","On Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 10-5 to recommend confirming Gina Haspel as CIA director, and sent her nomination to the full Senate for consideration. The Senate could vote on Haspel’s nomination as early as Thursday, according to Senate aides. 
With five Democrats saying they would vote for Haspel and two Republicans saying they would not, she could be confirmed by more than the minimum 50 votes needed in the Senate, which Republicans control 51-49.
Among the five Democrats who have said they would vote for Haspel, Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the minority leader on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, “I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the President if ordered to do something illegal or immoral -- like a return to torture.” Warner may have been referring to “enhanced interrogation” techniques such as waterboarding, a type of simulated drowning, that the CIA used after 9/11 and that some have called a form of “torture.”
During the part of her confirmation hearings open to the public last week, some senators asked Haspel about her time at the CIA when “enhanced interrogation” techniques were used. In her written responses to senators’ questions, Haspel wrote that the “enhanced interrogation program is not one the CIA should have undertaken” and that the U.S. “must be an example to the rest of the world.”
Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and John McCain (Ariz.) are two Republicans who have said they oppose Haspel’s nomination. Sen. John Flake (R-Ariz.) said he is undecided. 
McCain is unlikely to attend the vote for health reasons. After Haspel’s public confirmation hearing, McCain wrote that her “refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying.”
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the committee’s chairman, said Haspel was “the most qualified person” for the position and that “she has acted morally, ethically, and legally, over a distinguished 30-year career.”

34160,2018-05-16,North Korea says not interested in ‘one-sided’ talks with the US,"North Korea’s vice foreign minister said Wednesday that the U.S. must stop requiring the North to have “unilateral nuclear abandonment” in advance of talks between North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled for next month. North Korean state news outlet KCNA published the statement from the minister, Kim Gye Gwan, on Wednesday, after the North suspended talks with South Korea early Wednesday morning local time over military exercises the South was conducting with the U.S. 
A few hours after suspending the meeting with the South, North Korea said it was not interested in a “one-sided” meeting with the U.S. designed to have the North “abandon” its nuclear weapons program. 
If the U.S. is “sincere” in its approach to North Korea, it “will receive a deserved response from us,” Kim Gye Gwan said. “However, if the U.S. is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider proceeding with the North Korea-U.S. summit.” 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said about the North Korea statement on Wednesday, “if they want to meet, we’ll be ready and if they don’t that’s okay,” adding that Trump administration is “still hopeful” that the talks will proceed. Sanders said Trump was “ready for very tough negotiations,” and if the negotiations were canceled, the U.S. would “continue with the campaign of maximum pressure” against the North. 
Trump said “we’ll have to see” if the talks proceed in response to the North’s message. When asked if the U.S. would still pursue North Korean denuclearization, he nodded. 
The planned meeting between Kim and Trump, scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, would be the first between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. president. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to North Korea earlier this month in preparation, and the U.S. negotiated the return of three American citizens to the U.S. North Korea has canceled scheduled diplomatic talks in the past, The Associated Press and The Washington Post reported.
North Korea’s Kim has met with Chinese President Xi Jinping twice over the past two months. A Chinese government spokesman said the North and the U.S. should “meet each other halfway” in advance of the scheduled talks, and foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, “the situation on the [Korean] peninsula has eased up, which is worth cherishing.”
Canceled South Korea meeting
Early on Wednesday local time, the North suspended talks with the South that were scheduled for later that day, calling South Korea-U.S. joint military drills a “provocation” and a preparation for an invasion of North Korea. The U.S. and South Korea began conducting air combat drills called “Max Thunder” with U.S. stealth fighters a few days ago. It has conducted the drills every year for about the past decade. 
“The Max Thunder drill is training for pilot skill enhancement, not an attack drill or implementation of an operation plan,” a spokesperson for South Korea’s Defense Ministry said. 
Wednesday’s meeting between the Koreas was to be a follow-up to the April 27 meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Following that meeting, the two leaders issued a document called the “Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula.” That document announced the countries had agreed to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a formal close to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953. Wednesday’s meeting had been scheduled to discuss these goals.
KCNA reported that the military exercise was “a flagrant challenge to the Panmunjom Declaration and an intentional military provocation running counter to the positive political development on the Korean Peninsula.”
US strategy
Both Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have said the U.S. goal is for the North to have complete, “verifiable” and “irreversible” nuclear disarmament. Bolton said the North would need to agree to disarmament similar to the “Libyan model.” In 2003, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed to denuclearization in exchange for sanctions being lifted. Bolton was the under secretary of state for arms control at the time. Gadhafi was overthrown and killed by rebels in 2011.
Kim Gye Gwan said Wednesday that the “world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq, which have met a miserable fate,” adding the North has a “feeling of repugnance toward” Bolton.
Bolton’s statements are “not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue. It is essentially a manifestation of [an] awfully sinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq, which had been collapsed due to the yielding of their countries to big powers,” the vice minister said.

34093,2018-05-16,Gap apologizes for selling T-shirts with ‘incorrect’ China map,"American clothing retailer Gap Inc. apologized to China on Tuesday for selling T-shirts with an “incorrect” map of China on them. The T-shirts showed a map that did not include Taiwan, Southern Tibet and islands in the South China Sea that China claims. Gap said it “respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.”
Gap said it removed the shirts, which have been on sale in China, Canada and other overseas markets, from the shelves of Chinese stores and “concerned global markets,” and destroyed them. The company apologized for its “unintentional error” and said it would follow Chinese rules and laws. 
The People’s Daily, the official Chinese Communist Party newspaper, tweeted a picture of the Gap’s T-shirt next to a map that China considers accurate and mentioned Gap’s apology for printing an “incomplete” Chinese map. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the ministry would “follow carefully” the Gap’s “actions and remarks later on.”
Gap opened its first store in mainland China in 2010 and currently has 27 stores there. The company also has stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Foreign companies operating in China
Other companies, including Delta Air Lines, Marriott and the clothing company Zara, have apologized to China this year for referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet as independent countries in their promotional materials. The Chinese government considers them to be part of China. Mercedes-Benz apologized to China for posts quoting the Dalai Lama on social media, which it later removed. The Dalai Lama is the Tibetan spiritual leader who lives in exile.
In April, China’s aviation authority told 36 international airlines that if they did not show Taiwan, and Hong Kong and Macau as Chinese territories on their websites, there could be disruptions to their operations in China. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called this part of a “growing trend” by the Chinese Communist Party to “impose its political views on American citizens and private companies.”
Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, with a minority of countries recognizing its sovereignty as a nation independent of China. Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said China’s lobbying of companies to not refer to Taiwan as independent of China was “rather unfortunate in terms of cross-strait relations.” He said it would move people in Taiwan “further and further away” from China and not win their “hearts and minds.” 
Tibet is a region along China’s border with India that is under dispute: China claims Tibet as its own and Tibet claims it is an independent nation. Tibet’s exiled government is based in India. Macau is a former Portuguese colony and now semi-autonomous territory about 40 miles (64 km) from Hong Kong, which is itself a former British colony and now semi-autonomous Chinese territory.

34083,2018-05-16,Turkey expels Israeli ambassador to protest Gaza deaths; Israel expels Turkish consul,"Israel temporarily expelled the Turkish Consul General in Jerusalem on Tuesday after Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador to its country earlier in the day. Turkey had already withdrawn its ambassadors to Israel and the U.S. on Monday to protest the killing of at least 60 Palestinian protesters by Israeli forces and the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem that day. 
Israeli soldiers also killed at least two Palestinians during Tuesday’s protests, Haaretz reported. Israel said 24 of the 60 of the Palestinians who were killed Monday were “militants” who attempted to breach the Israeli-Gaza border fence.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also called on Husam Zomlot, Palestinian envoy to Washington, to return to Ramallah, a city in the West Bank, as a protest over the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Foreign Minister Riad Malki confirmed the move on Tuesday, according to AP.
The Palestinian protests in Gaza began on March 30 and called for the “right to return” to Israel for Palestinians whose ancestors lived there before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted the right to return.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Hamas sent Palestinians to attempt to breach the border fence. “The Hamas terrorist organization declares its intention to destroy Israel and sends thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal. We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and our citizens,” Netanyahu said on Monday.
Hamas is a political organization with an armed division that governs the Gaza territories; Israel and the U.S. have described it as a terrorist organization.
Israel has used tear gas on some protesters, and live ammunition on some who approached the border fence with Israel. Israel also said on Tuesday it delivered eight trucks worth of medical supplies and aid to Gaza.
International responses
South Africa recalled its ambassador to Israel on Monday, saying it condemned “in the strongest terms possible” the “violent aggression” by Israeli forces along the Gaza border. On Tuesday, Belgium and Ireland summoned their Israeli ambassadors to discuss the Gaza deaths. Both countries called for international investigations of the events in Gaza.
White House spokesman Raj Shah said on Monday, “The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas. Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response.” He added, “Israel has the right to defend itself.”
The EU’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called for Israeli forces to restrain from violence, as did the U.K. French President Emmanuel Macron said, “France is condemning the violence.”
A German foreign ministry spokeswoman said, “Israel has the right to defend itself and secure its [border] fence against violent intrusions, but the principle of proportionality applies.” The spokeswoman said that meant only using live ammunition when other forms of deterrence had been unsuccessful against specific threats.
The U.N. said, “those responsible for outrageous human rights violations must be held to account.”
West Bank protests
There were also protests in the West Bank over the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. Part of Jerusalem is located in the West Bank; Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed it in 1980. The annex is not recognized under international law and Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state. Israel wants all of Jerusalem to be its capital.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced last December that the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Palestinians held protests after his announcement.
Abbas said of the U.S. embassy opening, “It is a settlement, not an embassy. A U.S. settlement in East Jerusalem.”
Trump said in a recorded message at the embassy opening ceremony that the U.S. “remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement.”

34297,2018-05-17,1 Ebola case confirmed in DRC city of Mbandaka,"On Thursday, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga said there was one confirmed case of Ebola in Mbandaka city, which is adjacent to the Congo River. The city of about one million is approximately 80 miles (130 km) from rural areas where cases of the disease have been previously reported. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that in the past five weeks there were three confirmed, 21 suspected and 20 probable cases of Ebola in the country; 23 of them resulted in death.
Ebola is a virus that is transmitted from human to human through contact with bodily fluids, and has an average case fatality rate of about 50 percent, according to CNN. The disease can also be transmitted to humans from wild animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelope and porcupines. The incubation period ranges from two to 21 days, and symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat, which are sometimes followed by vomiting, diarrhea, skin lesions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.
The WHO has called an emergency meeting of experts to discuss the potential spread of the disease, and will meet Friday to decide if it should declare an international public health emergency as it did during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak. That outbreak spread to the capital cities of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and killed 11,300 people. WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions within DRC or internationally.
WHO official Peter Salama said the disease’s presence in a city was a “major development in the outbreak.” He added that there is now “potential” for an increase in cases.
On Wednesday, more than 4,000 doses of an unlicensed, experimental Ebola vaccine from pharmaceutical company Merck arrived in the DRC capital city of Kinshasa. A 2017 paper estimated the vaccine’s effectiveness in limited trials during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak was 100 percent. Salama said the vaccine would first be given to people in Mbandaka who may have been exposed to the virus.
Four people died during the previous Ebola outbreak in DRC in 2017.

34424,2018-05-18,110 killed in Boeing 737 crash after take off in Cuba (Update),"On Friday, 110 people were killed in a crash of a Boeing 737 airplane after it took off from the Jose Marti airport serving Havana, Cuba. Three female survivors are being treated at the General Calixto García University Hospital, Cuban newspaper Granma reported. 
Witnesses reported smoke and fire from the crash site, where rescue workers arrived on the scene within 12 minutes, according to Granma. Family members of the passengers have been asked to submit photographs and descriptive information to help authorities identify the deceased. 
The flight, DMJ 0972, was headed for the Cuban city of Holguin, about 500 miles (700 km) east of Havana, and crashed at about 12:08 p.m. local time. The plane was 30 years old and was on loan from a Mexican airline, Global Air, to Cuba's state airline Cubana de Aviacion, according to AFP. The cause of the accident is unknown. 
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel visited the crash site. He declared two days of national mourning for Saturday and Sunday and ordered an investigation of the crash.

Wilkie has been acting VA Secretary since March. In announcing Wilkie’s nomination, Trump said he “has done an incredible job at the VA.” 
Wilkie, 55, has also been the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness since November 2017. He served as Assistant Secretary of Defense from 2005-2009 under former Secretaries of Defense Robert Gates and Donald Rumsfeld. He is a reserve officer in the U.S. Air Force and has served in the Navy Reserve. 
In March, Trump fired previous VA head David Shulkin and said he would nominate Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was the White House physician at the time, as the replacement. Jackson withdrew as Trump’s nominee for the post last month, after allegations of driving while intoxicated and over-prescribing medications. He denied the allegations.

British authorities determined that Skripal was poisoned with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent, and that it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the attack. Russia denied the allegation. Russian President Vladimir Putin said of Skripal, “I wish him good health, we are very happy, actually.”
Putin also said, “Thank God [Skripal] recovered and that he left [the hospital].” Putin made his remarks while visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany. He said, “If a military-grade poisonous substance had been used, as our British colleagues claim, this person would have died right there on the spot.” Putin said military-grade poison kills in seconds or minutes. 
Last month, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed Novichok was used in the attack on the Skripals. The Soviet Union developed Novichok during the 1970s and 80s. British police said in March that of all of the sites they examined, they had identified the highest concentration of Novichok on the front door of Skripal’s home. 
Putin also said, “We have several times offered our British partners any necessary assistance in the investigation (of the poisoning). So far we have received no response. Our offer remains open.”
The U.K. expelled 23 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning. More than 20 countries expelled diplomats in response to the attack, including the U.S. In response, Russia announced it would expel 60 U.S. diplomats and 90 diplomats from the other countries that had expelled its diplomats.
Sergei Skripal’s daughter, Yulia, was released from the hospital last month.

34389,2018-05-18,"At least 10 dead in school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas","At least ten people were killed and injured by a gunman at Santa Fe High School in Texas on Friday, including nine students and one teacher, according to law enforcement officials. At least a dozen people were injured. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted it was no longer an “active situation” and that one suspect was in custody and another detained. 
Gonzalez said a police officer was among those injured. The gunman started shooting at around 7:45 a.m. local time and was uninjured in the incident, according to Galveston County Commissioner Joe Giusti. 
Gonzalez tweeted that the school district was transporting students to a nearby gym, Alamo Gym, where parents could reunite with them.
A student at the school told ABC13 that the fire alarm went off in the school at about 7:45 a.m. Among the dead were both adults and students, according to ABC13.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said it was responding to the incident.
The Santa Fe Independent School Department tweeted at 10:41 a.m. local time that explosives were found at and near the school. It said, “law enforcement was in the process of rendering them safe.”
Earlier this week, on Wednesday, a school resource officer at Dixon High School in Illinois chased and fired at a 19-year-old suspect who fired shots near an auditorium where a high school graduation ceremony rehearsal was underway. No one was killed in that incident.

34333,2018-05-18,Senate confirms Gina Haspel as CIA director,"On Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted 54-45 to confirm Gina Haspel as director of the CIA. Six Democrats voted in favor and two Republicans voted against her confirmation. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was not present for the vote due to health reasons. The Senate Intelligence Committee recommended Haspel’s confirmation with a 10-5 vote on Wednesday. She is currently the CIA’s deputy director and acting director and, when sworn in, she will become the first woman to lead the intelligence agency.
During part of her confirmation hearings, which were open to the public last week, some senators asked Haspel about her time at the CIA after 9/11 when “enhanced interrogation” techniques were used. In her written responses to senators’ questions, Haspel wrote that the “enhanced interrogation program is not one the CIA should have undertaken” and that the U.S. “must be an example to the rest of the world.”
Also during the public hearing, Haspel said, “I would not allow [the] CIA to undertake activity that is immoral, even if it is technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it. I believe [the] CIA must undertake activities that are consistent with American values.”
Haspel began working with the agency in 1985.

34307,2018-05-18,EU to activate 1996 law prohibiting European company compliance with US sanctions on Iran,"On Thursday, European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said the commission would begin the process of activating a 1996 “blocking statute” to prohibit European companies from complying with U.S. sanctions on Iran. The statute would also prohibit courts from enforcing U.S. sanctions on European companies. On May 8, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and would re-implement sanctions against Iran.
Trump said in his announcement that the U.S. would implement 90- to 180-day “wind-down” periods for companies to stop doing business with Iran. Trump said after the wind-down period there could be “severe consequence” for companies that continue doing business with Iran.
Under the so-called “Iran nuclear deal,” formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to give up or limit nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran signed the agreement. The EU, Russia and China have said they would honor their parts of the agreement with Iran after the U.S. announced its withdrawal. Iran has not announced whether it would stay in the agreement with the remaining parties.
Juncker said the commission has a “duty to protect European companies.” He said the process of activating the “blocking statute” would begin Friday morning. Activating the statute requires amending it with the approval of the EU’s 28 member states. Mina Andreeva, spokesperson for European Commission, said the commission’s goal was to have the statute in place by Aug. 6, the end of the 90-day “wind-down” period.
The EU passed the 1996 statute to cover the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, and sanctions on Iran and Libya. It has not been activated since the EU and the U.S. made political agreements on the sanctions and embargo. The statute specifies that each EU member state “shall determine the sanctions to be imposed in the event of breach” of the statute. “Such sanctions must be effective, proportional and dissuasive,” it adds. Some European companies with operations in the U.S. are lobbying their countries to grant them waivers from the blocking statute.
German insurance company Allianz and Danish shipping company Maersk have said they plan to stop doing business in Iran due to the U.S. sanctions.
Juncker also said the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, would allow the European Investment Bank to begin facilitating investments of EU companies in Iran. This could allow loans to Iran in euros.

34310,2018-05-18,Trump says ‘nothing has changed’ on planned meeting with North Korean leader,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump spoke about his planned June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying, ""Nothing has changed on North Korea that we know of.” He added, “If [the meeting] doesn’t take place, that’s fine, and if it does take place, I think some tremendous things can happen.” Trump’s comments came after North Korea suspended talks with South Korea on Wednesday.
When North Korea suspended talks with the South on denuclearization and a formal close to the 1950-1953 Korean War, it described joint military exercises the U.S. and South Korea had scheduled for that day as a “provocation” and a preparation for an invasion of the North. South Korea said the exercises were not an “attack drill.” The U.S. and South Korea have conducted the drills every year for about the past decade.
Trump said of the North Korea meeting preparations: “North Korea is actually talking to us about times and everything else as though nothing happened.” He made his comments during a meeting at the White House with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
North Korea said Wednesday it was not interested in a “one-sided” meeting with the U.S. that would have the North “abandon” its nuclear weapons program. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan said the “world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq, which have met a miserable fate.” 
In 2003, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed to denuclearization in exchange for sanctions being lifted. Rebels overthrew and killed Gadhafi in 2011. National Security Adviser John Bolton said in April that the U.S. had “in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004” in regards to North Korean nuclear disarmament. 
Trump said, ""the Libyan model isn't a model that we have at all when we're thinking of North Korea.” He said, “In Libya we decimated that country,” adding, ""There was no deal to keep Qaddafi."" Trump also said, “That model would take place if we don't make a deal [with North Korea], most likely.”
Trump said if North Korea agreed to denuclearize, Kim would “get protections that would be very strong."" He said it would be “something where [Kim would] be there, he'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.”
Trump added he is ""willing to do a lot"" to provide security assurances to Kim. ""The best thing he could do is make a deal.""

34613,2018-05-21,Hawaiian volcanic lava enters ocean creating hazardous gas,"Volcanic lava on Hawaii’s Big Island reached the Pacific Ocean over the weekend, creating a hazardous white plume containing hydrochloric acid and fine particles of glass. The lava flow entered the ocean on the island’s southern coast on Saturday night, according to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), after the Kilauea volcano began erupting two and a half weeks ago. The flow crossed Highway 137 and created a 20-foot wall across the highway around 10:30 p.m. local time on Saturday, CBS News reported. 
The plume of particles and acidic gas known as “laze,” a combination of “lava” and “haze,” can cause eye and skin irritation, difficulty breathing and, the HVO said, in past cases has caused death. The laze had traveled 15 miles (24 km) west of the entry point as on Monday morning. A U.S. Geological Survey scientist said it was running parallel to the coast. 
The U.S. Coast Guard implemented a “Lava Entry Safety Zone” 984 feet (300 meters) around the lava ocean entry point, indicating where navigable waters began. “Getting too close to the lava can result in serious injury or death,” U.S. Coast Guard representative Lt. Cmdr. John Bannon said. 
Since Kilauea began erupting on May 3, it has burned approximately 40 buildings, including homes, and about 2,000 people have been evacuated. Roughly 300 people are staying in shelters, CBS News reported. 
There have been about 2,250 earthquakes on or around the Big Island since May 3, including a 5.0 and a 4.9 magnitude tremor each at the summit of the volcano, according to meteorologist Haley Brink. Kilauea Volcano erupted at least twice over the weekend, including one incident that created a 10,000 foot (3 km) tall ash cloud. Hawaii County has issued warnings about the air quality. 
At least 23 fissures have opened up since May 3, and the rate of sulfur dioxide gas escaping from the fissures has tripled, according to the HVO. 
 
Last week, President Donald Trump declared a “major disaster” on the Big Island. Hawaiian Gov. David Ige said the state was monitoring the situation, and as with “typical eruptions and lava flows,” would allow the eruption “to run its course.”
Hawaiian tourism officials said the majority of the Big Island is unaffected and available for access.

34527,2018-05-21,"US-China tariffs ‘on hold,’ Mnuchin says","On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the U.S. and China have put tariffs “on hold,” and that the two countries had agreed on a “framework” to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Prior to this agreement, the U.S. had considered applying $50 to $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, and China had said it would consider $50 billion worth of tariffs on U.S. exports including farm and chemical goods. Officials from both countries held discussions in Washington on Thursday and Friday. 
The U.S. had a trade deficit with China of $375 billion in 2017, according to Politico. 
According to a joint statement released Saturday, China will “significantly increase” its purchases of U.S. goods and services. Mnuchin said there were ""specific targets"" that “go industry by industry,” and that he would not ""publicly disclose what they are.” The U.S. is planning to send a delegation to China, which includes U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, for discussions on increasing exports of U.S. agriculture and energy products, according to Mnuchin.
The two countries also agreed they both valued intellectual property protection, and China is planning to revise its patent law and other intellectual property laws and regulations, according to the statement. 
During the negotiations, the U.S. was represented by Mnuchin, Ross and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and China was represented by special envoy and Vice Premier Liu He.

34524,2018-05-21,Trump says he will ‘demand’ DOJ investigate whether FBI ‘infiltrated or surveilled’ Trump campaign,"On Sunday, President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he would officially ask the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate whether the “FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled” the Trump campaign for political reasons during the 2016 presidential election. He questioned whether “any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration.” He said he would make his “demand” official on Monday. The DOJ declined to comment.
Trump’s comments on Twitter followed a Friday tweet in which he said reports showed there was “at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign.” The summer before the election, the FBI sent an informant to talk to Trump’s campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, and later to campaign aide Carter Page, according to The New York Times. The FBI had received evidence the two had “suspicious” contacts linked to Russia, the newspaper reported.
In February, Republicans from the House Intelligence Committee released a memo that said there were “concerns with legitimacy and legality” in FBI and DOJ efforts to obtain a 2016 surveillance warrant on Page. Later that month, Democrats from the House Intelligence Committee released a memo that concluded the DOJ “did not ‘abuse’” the process to obtain the surveillance warrant. Committee Republicans released a “point by point refutation” of the Democrats’ memo the same day. 
In March, the DOJ announced it would investigate how the FBI obtained the surveillance warrant on Page. 
In a separate investigation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. 
Trump’s full tweets

Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a “hot” Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal! (May 18)
I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration! (May 20)

34521,2018-05-21,Verge publishes Google video proposing multigenerational user data could benefit future humans,"On Thursday, the Verge published a 2016 internal video from Google that examines the possibility of collecting a kind of digital genetic code, or “ledger,” for a person that could be passed from one generation to the next, similar to genetic information. The video explores hypothetical uses of such a ledger, such as directing people’s behavior in order to reach a goal, making “accurate predictions about decisions and future behaviors,” or developing “a species-level understanding of complex issues such as depression, health, and poverty.”
The video was authored by Google employees Nick Foster and David Murphy. Foster is the head of design at X, a research and development subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet that looks “for the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology.” Foster is also co-founder of the Near Future Laboratory, a research and development company based in California and Europe.
X says its mission is to “invent and launch ‘moonshot’ technologies” it estimates “could someday make the world a radically better place.” The Near Future Laboratory says it is a “thinking, making, design, development, and research practice” focusing on what the future may be like and how to influence it towards “more habitable near future worlds.”
Contents of the video
The video, titled “The Selfish Ledger,” begins by mentioning an 1809 evolutionary theory by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. The “Lamarckian epigenetics” theory, as it is called, postulates that experiences an organism has during its life modify its genetic code, and that is passed to the next generation. The video says Lamarck’s theory is “biologically inaccurate.” In the area of biology, that theory was replaced by Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, after he published “Origin of the Species” in 1859. 
The video said the Lamarckian theory is a useful metaphor for thinking about a so-called ""ledger"" of data, or a kind of digital genetic code. The ledger would contain information on users’ “actions, decisions, preferences, movement and relationships” obtained by analyzing data from technology such as phones and internet search engines. The ledger would evolve with time as more user data is collected, and this information could be passed to future generations after the user died.
In 1976, Richard Dawkins published a book called “The Selfish Gene,” upon which the video’s title is based. The book presents a view of evolution in which a behavior is replicated in a species for the benefit of the gene, not the overall organism. The individual organism is described as a “transient carrier” or “survival machine” for the gene. The Google video proposes its “ledger” of user data could be thought of as a “gene,” and the user as the organism.
In the video, the narrator asks, “What if the ledger could be given a volition or purpose rather than simply acting as a historical reference?” The video says the examples it provides about this “reflect Google’s values as an organization,” such as health and the environment. The video said Google would provide goals for the ledger that ""reflect"" its ""values as an organization."" Users could select from these goals and based on their selections, Google could present options that allow the ledger “to move closer to its goal,"" such as buying local produce. Over time, ""the user’s behavior may be modified and the ledger moves closer to its target,"" the video says.
The video also mentions a scenario in which a computer connected to manufacturing equipment makes personalized devices that collect more user data, thus filling in areas of missing data in a user’s ledger. A more complete ledger could provide more accurate behavioral predictions.
The video says multigenerational data could be used to “make increasingly accurate predictions” about human behavior and decisions. It adds, “As cycles of collection and comparison extend, it may be possible to develop a species-level understanding of complex issues such as depression, health and poverty.” The narrator says this could be considered analogous to modifying the human genome towards certain outcomes, such as disease prevention. The video says, “it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the preceding generation’s behaviors and decisions.” 
Comments by X on the video’s content
The Verge prefaced its article by writing that the video “offers a stunningly ambitious and unsettling look at how some at the company envision using that information in the future.” Regarding the video, an X spokesperson told The Verge: “We understand if this is disturbing -- it is designed to be. This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as ‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate. It’s not related to any current or future products.”

34735,2018-05-22,Iraq sentences Belgian IS member to death,"On Tuesday, Iraq’s Central Criminal Court sentenced Tarek Jadaoun to death by hanging for his alleged role as a senior foreign fighter for the Islamic State (IS). Jadaoun, a 30-year-old Belgian citizen also known as Abu Hamza al-Beljik, reportedly joined IS in 2014 and has appeared in the group’s videos.
“[Jadaoun], who is of Moroccan origin, is one of the most wanted foreign fighters who fought on behalf of the terrorist organization in Syria and Iraq,” Judge Abdul-Sattar al-Birqdar said in a statement.
Jadaoun was arrested in Mosul in 2017 and pleaded not guilty to the terrorism-related charges against him. He was also sentenced to three years in prison and given a $2,300 (2,000 euros) fine for illegally crossing the Iraqi border. He has 30 days to appeal the verdict.
Jadaoun said during a May 10 hearing that he was forced by an IS commander to appear in videos threatening to attack Belgium and France.
Brussels, which opposes the death penalty, requested that Jadaoun’s sentence be “commuted,” or changed to a lesser penalty. “We would like the death sentence to be changed to life imprisonment,” Belgian foreign ministry spokesman Didier Vanderhasselt told AFP.
Iraq is in the process of prosecuting hundreds of suspected IS members, according to Reuters. Iraq declared victory over IS in December.

34728,2018-05-22,Facebook CEO Zuckerberg discusses data protection with EU lawmakers,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with EU lawmakers on Tuesday to answer questions about data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook users’ personal data. Zuckerberg said Facebook had not “done enough to prevent the tools we’ve built from being used for harm as well.”
“Whether it’s fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing people’s information, we didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibilities. That was a mistake, and I’m sorry,” said Zuckerberg.
EU Parliament members asked Zuckerberg about new EU data protection rules, data privacy, online bullying, monopoly power and targeted advertising.
Zuckerberg did not answer certain questions on the “cross-use of data” from Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service, and on the blocking of target ads, Reuters reported. Instead, Zuckerberg said he would follow up with answers later.
Zuckerberg said Facebook expected to comply with new EU rules, called the General Data Protection Regulation, which take effect this Friday. One rule stipulates that consumers must give “affirmative consent” before their data can be used by a business. Companies in violation of the new rules may receive fines of up to “4 percent of the company’s worldwide turnover,” or up to 20 million euros.
In April, Facebook said that data from about 87 million users, 2.7 million of which reside in the EU, had been “improperly shared” with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has suspended 200 apps from its platforms as part of its internal investigation into third-party apps with access to user data.
Zuckerberg also said 500 million fake accounts were removed from the platform in the first quarter of 2018. He also said that Facebook’s artificial intelligence systems can now flag 90 percent of content related to Islamic State and other militant groups without requiring user intervention.
As Zuckerberg noted during his testimony with U.S. lawmakers, he said Facebook plans to hire additional staff and develop artificial intelligence to recognize “hate speech.”
According to Reuters, Zuckerberg plans to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday; he has declined to speak with British lawmakers. According to the Independent, Facebook plans to send either Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, or Chris Cox, its chief product officer, in the CEO’s place. The company did not provide a reason why Zuckerberg would not attend.

34729,2018-05-22,"FIFA to end its ‘doping’ investigation of Russian team, citing ‘insufficient evidence’","The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced Tuesday that it was ending its investigation into whether Russian soccer players planning to compete in this year’s World Cup used performance-enhancing drugs. FIFA said it found “insufficient evidence” to “assert an anti-doping rule violation.”

FIFA began its investigation in response to a report Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren issued for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that alleged Russia had a “state-sponsored” system for providing performance enhancing drugs to the country’s athletes between 2012 and 2015. 
After McLaren issued his report, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) revoked at least 13 medals won by Russian athletes in the 2014 Olympics, for biathlon, bobsled, cross-country skiing, skeleton and speed skating. The IOC also banned Russia from competing in the 2018 Olympic games for all sports, and allowed Russian athletes to instead compete as “neutrals.”

In its announcement, FIFA said it had informed WADA of its conclusions, and “WADA in turn has agreed with FIFA's decision to close the cases.” The McLaren report named several Russian soccer players but they were never publicly identified, according to AFP. FIFA said it reviewed “all information and evidence contained in the McLaren report, with the support of scientific and legal experts.” 

FIFA spoke with McLaren and Grigory Rodchenkov, who had initially alleged Russia had the “doping” system. The association also re-analyzed players’ urine samples for banned substances. “All results were negative,” FIFA said. 

The association said an investigation of “several players unrelated to the FIFA World Cup” was still ongoing and FIFA would “continue to work on these cases in cooperation with WADA.”
The FIFA 2018 World Cup is scheduled to begin June 14 in Russia.

34661,2018-05-22,British former MP Ken Livingstone announces resignation from Labour party,"Ken Livingstone, former Mayor of London and British Member of Parliament (MP), announced Monday he would resign from the Labour party, saying “ongoing issues” regarding his 2016 suspension from the party were a “distraction” from the party’s goals. Livingstone was suspended and under investigation for “anti-Semitism” over a comment he made that Adolf Hitler was “supporting Zionism” in 1932 with a “policy” that “Jews should be moved to Israel.” In announcing his resignation, Livingstone said he “did not accept” an allegation that he was guilty of anti-Semitism, but that he didn’t want the disciplinary investigations against him to “drag on” for months or years.  
The “ongoing issues” are a “distraction from the key political issue of our time – which is to replace a Tory government,” Livingstone said. The “Tory” government refers to the British Conservative Party, which is the current governing party in the U.K.
Background
Livingstone, a former London mayor, was suspended in April 2016 following comments he made on BBC Radio London. He was speaking about MP Naz Shah, who had posted a image on Facebook that proposed relocating Israel to the U.S. as a “solution” to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Shah published the post in 2014 prior to winning her seat in parliament, and in 2016 apologized for the post and said it did not reflect her current views. 
Livingstone said Shah’s post was “completely over the top” and “rude,” but not anti-Semitic. He said, “don’t confuse anti-Semitism with criticism of the Israeli government policy.” 
Livingstone also said, “When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.” In 1933, Hitler’s government made an agreement with a Jewish company, the Haavara Agreement, that allowed Jews to export wealth in the form of German goods, designed to facilitate Jewish emigration to Palestine. The agreement aided 60,000 German Jews' immigration to Palestine between1933 and 1939, according to the Jewish Virtual Library. ""They didn't like each other but they collaborated to [have Jews emigrate],"" Livingstone said about the agreement. 
Critics argue this is not “supporting Zionism.” Eight years earlier, Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf: “the Jews again most slyly dupe the stupid [non-Jews]. They have no thought of building up a Jewish State in Palestine, so that they might perhaps inhabit it, but they only want a central organization of their international world cheating, ... drawn from the seizure of others.” 
Response
At the time of Livingstone’s comments, Labour MP Rachel Reeves said “we’ve got a growing problem of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party,” and Lord Michael Levy, a Labour member of the House of Lords, said the party had a “serious problem” with anti-Semitism. Labour MP John Mann accused Livingstone of being a “Nazi apologist.” Livingstone said he was not saying that Hitler was a “Zionist.” 
Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn suspended Livingstone from the party for two years pending an internal investigation. The suspension was extended in March of this year. Livingstone said Monday that he had been informed by his lawyer the disciplinary action could continue for months or years. Livingston said that since he was not planning to run for election, he would resign from the party.
In his resignation announcement Monday, Livingstone said that “the way I made a historical argument has caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. I am truly sorry for that.” 
He said, “I do not accept the allegation … that I am in any way guilty of anti-Semitism,” saying “I abhor anti-Semitism, I have fought it all my life and will continue to do so.”
Corbyn said, “Ken Livingstone‘s resignation is sad after such a long and vital contribution to London and progressive politics, but was the right thing to do.” He also noted that Livingstone’s comments have been ""grossly insensitive.""
Livingstone’s career
Livingstone joined the Labour party in 1969, first holding elected office in 1971. He was elected as an MP in 1987, and then served as the mayor of London from 2000 to 2008.  
In 2006, Livingstone was suspended by ethical boards for four weeks for asking Oliver Finegold, a Jewish reporter, “Were you a German war criminal?” and comparing him to a concentration camp guard. Livingstone won an appeal against his suspension with the High Court of Justice.
Livingstone could be eligible to rejoin the party at a later date as a ""suspended member"" with his disciplinary case still active, The Guardian reported.

34658,2018-05-22,US Secretary of State lists 12 requirements for potential new Iran agreement,"On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke about the “flaws” of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and listed 12 U.S. requirements for a potential new agreement with Iran. President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that the U.S. would withdraw from the 2015 deal, saying the decision was to prevent nuclear proliferation in Iran. Britain, France and Germany have said they continue to support the deal.
Pompeo, speaking at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., said the JCPOA’s “sunset provisions,” or clauses that would expire after a certain number of years, delayed Iran’s “inevitable” nuclear weapons capability. The “mechanisms for inspecting and verifying Iran’s compliance” with the JCPOA were not sufficient, Pompeo argued, adding that the agreement failed to address Iran’s development of ballistic and cruise missiles. 
In his speech, Pompeo said the U.S. would impose further sanctions on Iran, the “strongest sanctions in history,” if the regime does not “change its course.” He said the Department of Defense and U.S. allies would “deter Iranian aggression” in the region. 
Pompeo said the U.S. was “open to new steps” with Iran and gave 12 requirements for a new agreement. He outlined the steps in his speech as the following: 
1. Iran must declare a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.
2. Iran must stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor.
3. Iran must provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.
4. Iran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.
5. Iran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of U.S. partners and allies.
6. Iran must end support for Middle East “terrorist groups,” including Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
7. Iran must “respect the sovereignty” of the Iraqi government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shiite militias.
8. Iran must end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a “peaceful political settlement” in Yemen.
9. Iran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.
10. Iran must end support for the Taliban and other “terrorists” in Afghanistan and the region, and “cease harboring” al-Qaida leaders.
11. Iran must end the support of Iran’s Quds Force (the special forces of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp) “ for terrorists and militant partners around the world.”
12. Iran must end its “threatening behavior against its neighbors,” including its threats to destroy Israel, its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, its threats to international shipping, and cyberattacks.
Responses to Pompeo’s speech
The European Union said in a statement: “Secretary Pompeo’s speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the JCPOA has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence Iran’s conduct in areas outside the scope of JCPOA. There is no alternative to the JCPOA.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was quoted on state television, saying, “Who are you to decide for Iran and the world? The world today does not accept America to decide for the world ... We will continue our path with the support of our nation.”

34655,2018-05-22,US Supreme Court rules companies can include arbitration clauses in employment contracts,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 that companies can include arbitration clauses in employment contracts to prevent workers from engaging in collective legal action for wage or workplace disputes. The decision could affect 25 million employment contracts, according to The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the question being examined was: “Should employees and employers be allowed to agree that any disputes between them will be resolved through one-on-one arbitration? Or should employees always be permitted to bring their claims in class or collective actions, no matter what they agreed with their employers?”
“As a matter of law the answer is clear,” Gorsuch wrote. “In the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms – including terms providing for individualized proceedings,” he wrote.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored the dissenting opinion. In reference to Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), she wrote, “in addition to protecting employees’ rights ‘to form, join, or assist labor organizations’ and ‘to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,’ the Act protects employees’ rights ‘to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of . . . mutual aid or protection.’” She said she believed the Section 7 rights “include the right to pursue collective litigation regarding [employees’] wages and hours,” and that “the employer-dictated collective-litigation stoppers, i.e., ‘waivers,’ are unlawful.” She read her dissent from the bench. 
Gorsuch, along with Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr., voted in favor of the ruling.
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented.
In a 2011 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that companies could include arbitration clauses in contracts with consumers, as opposed to employees, to prohibit class action suits and instead require the consumers to enter individual arbitrations during disputes. The court voted 5-4 on that case, ATT Mobility v. Concepcion. Such clauses are now often included in contracts for cell phones, credit cards and rental cars, according to The New York Times.

34652,2018-05-22,Maduro wins second term in Venezuela’s presidential elections,"Venezuelan incumbent President Nicolás Maduro won a second six-year term in the country’s election on Sunday. He received 5.8 million votes, approximately 68 percent of the popular vote, with 92 percent of voting centers reporting their results, according to Venezuela’s electoral commission. Voter turnout was 46 percent, lower than the approximately 80 percent turnout during the last two presidential elections, according to The New York Times.
Of the other candidates, Henri Falcón, a former state governor, received 1.8 million votes and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical minister, received 925,000 votes. 
Maduro gave a speech Sunday night in Caracas, calling the vote an “impeccable electoral process,” and saying, “the whole of Venezuela has triumphed.” Maduro, 55, served as Venezuela’s vice president from October 2012 to March 2013, and was then elected president in 2013 after the death of President Hugo Chávez. 
Maduro’s current term is scheduled to run through the end of this year, and his second term until the end of 2024.
Prior to the election results being published, Falcón said, “We don’t recognize this electoral process as valid,” adding that “for us, there was no election. There must be a new election in Venezuela.” Electoral authorities had banned some opposition political parties and prevented some politicians from running prior to the vote,The New York Times reported. Some opposition politicians called for an election boycott.
International response to the election
The United States and the 14-nation Lima group, a regional bloc that seeks to resolve the “breakdown of democratic order” in Venezuela, said they did not recognize Venezuela’s election results. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. would “take swift economic and diplomatic actions” to support the “restoration” of Venezuela’s “democracy.” The U.S. sanctioned Venezuelan officials last year and prohibited transactions with Venezuela’s new “petro” digital currency earlier this year, both in response to allegations by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that Venezuelan officials tampered with the country’s Oct. 15 state elections.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, currently in Buenos Aires at a meeting of G20 foreign ministers, said the group would “be talking about what we can do,” and saying they “see no alternative to [adding] economic pressure” on the country through sanctions.
Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel congratulated Maduro on his election victory, and Russian President Vladimir Putin wished Maduro “good health and success in resolving the social and economic problems” in Venezuela.
Venezuelan economy
Venezuela’s inflation was more than 4,000 percent last year, and its currency, the bolivar, lost 98 percent of its value, according to CNN. Last year, the country defaulted on foreign debt payments, according to Standard

34740,2018-05-23,Hawaii’s Kilauea lava flow moves south toward power plant,"The Hawaii County Civil Defense agency announced Monday evening that the Big Island’s Kilauea lava flow had begun moving toward the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) power plant, which contributes 38 megawatts of power to the island.
PGV uses hot liquid and steam from underground wells to move turbine generators that create electricity for sale to the state’s utility, Hawaii Electric Light Company. After the volcano began erupting on May 3, the company shut down the wells, which run about 6,000 to 8,000 feet deep, and removed about 60,000 gallons of the flammable chemical pentane from the site.
“County, state, and federal partners have been collaborating closely to monitor the situation and work with PGV to ensure the safety of the surrounding communities,” the Hawaiian civil defense agency said. “Ten of the eleven wells have been quenched. Efforts are ongoing to make sure the site is secure and the community is kept safe.” 
Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency chief, Tom Travis, explained that “quenching” refers to filling the underground wells “full of cold water so that the weight of the cold water sitting in the pipe is sufficient [so] that instead of hot water entering the bottom of the well, cold water exits the bottom of the well.” Travis noted that once the “quenching” is complete, the power plant “will be in a much more solid state for having lava overflow the site,” if lava reaches PGV. He also said workers might plug the wells with mud and cap them with iron plugs to prevent possible explosions or the release of toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfate.
Since Kilauea began erupting earlier this month, it has burned approximately 40 buildings, including homes, and about 2,000 people have been evacuated. Over the weekend, the lava flow entered the Pacific Ocean, creating a white plume containing hydrochloric acid and fine particles of glass. Officials have given affected residents on the Big Island particulate masks that filter ash to aid in breathing, CNN reported.
The state closed about two-thirds of Hawaii’s Volcanoes National Park on May 11. According to a report published by the National Park Service (NPS) last month, the park has had a 58 percent increase in visitors since 2008. In 2017, the park had a total of 2,016,702 visitors, which NPS said contributed to $166 million spent in communities near the park.

34822,2018-05-24,US House passes bill to modify Dodd-Frank rules,"The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill to modify regulations placed on the banking industry by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Under the new bill, the asset threshold at which banks and other financial companies will be automatically required to perform a “stress test” at least annually would be increased from $10 billion to $250 billion. 
Companies with assets between $100 and $250 billion would still be subject to “periodic” stress tests at the discretion of the governing body. “Stress tests” examine how a company might fare in a financial downturn. 
The House voted 258-159 on a version of the bill, called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, after the Senate passed a version by a vote of 67-31 in March. The two bills must be reconciled and signed by the president before becoming law. 
The new bill also exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the “Volcker rule,” which currently prohibits them from proprietary trading and from making certain investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds. 
The bill also reduces some home mortgage regulations and reporting requirements. 
White House officials said President Donald Trump would sign the Republican-drafted bill, which 33 House Democrats and 17 Senate Democrats had voted for along with Republicans. 
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed after the economic recession of 2008 to “promote the financial stability” of the U.S. Its goals are to improve “accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.” The concept of “too big to fail” refers to when a given company “has become so large that a government will provide assistance to prevent its failure because not doing so would have a disastrous ripple effect throughout the economy,” according to Investopedia.
The number of banks subject to the Dodd-Frank regulations under the new bill would decrease from 38 to 12, according to The Washington Post. Institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo would still be subject to the original Dodd-Frank regulations, NPR reported.
The new bill also leaves intact other elements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",Economy|Law &amp; Justice|The Facts,USA,,U.S. House of Representatives,Washington,banking|Dodd-Frank Act|legislation|regulation,world_news,publish
34819,2018-05-24,US disinvites China from summer RimPac military exercises,"The Pentagon said Wednesday that it had disinvited China from participating in the multinational “RimPac” naval exercises that the U.S. is organizing for this summer. The Pentagon said the decision was a response to China’s military presence in the South China Sea. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the South China Sea islands are Chinese territory and its military activities are “normal trainings.”
The disinvitation was “an initial response to China’s continued militarization of the South China Sea,” said Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. “China’s behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the RimPac exercise.”
Defense Secretary James Mattis made the decision to disinvite China in consultation with the White House, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The official said the U.S. has imagery showing China deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and jammers in the South China Sea area. The U.S. called on China to remove these systems, AP reported.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the U.S. decision “unhelpful.” Wang compared China’s military presence on South China Sea islands to the U.S.’ in Hawaii and Guam, saying it was “out of necessary defense purposes” and has “nothing to do with militarization.”
China has claimed it has sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea, which are also claimed by other countries. Last week, Chinese state media said China had been able to land and take off bomber airplanes, including its H-6K, which is capable of carrying supersonic cruise missiles, on a South China Sea island.
China participated in the 2014 and 2016 RimPac maritime exercises. The exercises, in the Pacific Ocean and near the Hawaiian islands, are designed to help “participants foster and sustain the cooperative relationships critical to ensuring the safety of sea lanes and security on the world’s oceans,” according to the U.S. military.
In 2016, 45 ships, 200 aircraft and more than 25,000 people from 26 nations participated in the maneuvers, a defense official told CNN. RimPac stands for Rim of the Pacific.

34813,2018-05-24,Judge rules Trump blocking users on twitter unconstitutional,"A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday that it was unconstitutional for President Donald Trump to block users from viewing his @realDonaldTrump Twitter account. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University brought the case last July, arguing that Trump’s Twitter account is a “public forum” under the First Amendment. The judge agreed that the account qualified as a “public forum” and that blocking users violated their First Amendment rights.
Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote in her ruling, “We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account -- the ‘interactive space’ where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President's tweets -- are properly analyzed under the ‘public forum’ doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment.”
“While we must recognize, and are sensitive to, the President’s personal First Amendment rights, he cannot exercise those rights in a way that infringes the corresponding First Amendment rights of those who have criticized him,” the judge continued. 
The Department of Justice had argued that blocked individuals could still access Trump’s tweets by not logging in to Twitter. Buchwald ruled that blocking users from interacting directly with Trump on Twitter was a violation of a “real, albeit narrow, slice of [free] speech.”
Buchwald also wrote, “no government official -- including the President -- is above the law, and all government officials are presumed to follow the law as has been declared.”
The Knight First Amendment Institute brought the suit against Trump and two of his aides on behalf of seven people whose Twitter accounts had been blocked by the president’s account.
At a hearing in March, Buchwald had proposed that the parties settle out of court, suggesting that Trump could mute rather than block people from his account. 
If someone blocks an account, it makes it so the owner of the blocked account cannot follow the blocker, find tweets sent by him or her when logged into Twitter and searching, or send direct messages to the blocker. If an account is muted, it can still follow and direct message. If a user mutes an account he or she does not follow, he or she will not see replies from that account in any Twitter conversations clicked into and muted account’s tweets will not appear in their Twitter timelines.
Trump’s @realDonaldTrump account currently has 52.2 million followers; his @POTUS account has 23.2 million followers.
The ruling does not affect private citizens’ ability to block Twitter accounts.

34810,2018-05-24,NFL owners approve national anthem policy,"National Football League (NFL) Commissioner Roger Goodell announced on Wednesday that owners had approved a rule that would fine teams if their players on the field do not stand for the national anthem. The new policy also allows players to remain in the locker room during the anthem, in lieu of standing.
Of the owners who voted, the decision was unanimous. San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York said he abstained from voting.
Background
Beginning in 2016 and continuing during the 2017 season, some NFL players did not stand during the playing of the U.S. national anthem. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first to sit, and then kneel during the anthem. He said he did not want to “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” (For more background, see our context section here.)
Last September, President Donald Trump tweeted, “Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!” He also said players who did not stand should be “fired.”
The policy
Prior to the ruling, the NFL’s game operations manual said players were required to be on the field and that they “should” stand for the anthem, since 2009. The league did not previously have codified penalties against players not standing. The new policy will remove the requirement that players be on the field while the anthem is played. 
Under the new policy, individual teams could discipline their players for not standing for the pre-game anthem. The NFL’s statement on the new rules also said, “the Commissioner will impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.” 
The statement did not define what it meant by “show respect.” Goodell said the NFL’s policy included standing at “attention, hats off and focused.” Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney he would consider raising a fist or linking arms during the anthem, which players have done, as an example of not showing respect. 
Goodell said, “The efforts by many of our players sparked awareness and action around issues of social justice that must be addressed.” He also said, “We are honored to work with our players to drive progress.”
“It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic. This is not and was never the case,” Goodell said. 
Players’ association response
The NFL Players’ Association (NFLPA) said it would review the policy and “challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement.” It also said: 

The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this new ‘policy.’ NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about. 

The NFL owners met and discussed the issue for two hours on Tuesday and another hour on Wednesday before voting. The NFLPA was not present at those meetings. Goodell said he met with players over the past year to discuss the issue. 
“We’ve talked to tens if not hundreds of players about this over the last year or so to get their input, to understand their position and, again, to respect them as I think we’ve stated here,” Goodell said.
This week, the NFL agreed with players to put $89 million towards national and local “social justice” projects over the next seven years to address “some of the underlying issues” behind the anthem protests, according to Mark Murphy, the Green Bay Packers’ president.

34882,2018-05-25,Trump says he’s ‘talking to’ North Korea after canceling planned summit with leader Kim (Update),"President Donald Trump said on Friday morning that he was “talking to” North Korea after the day before canceling a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un planned for next month. “We’ll see what happens, it could even be the 12th,” Trump said, referring to the June 12 date for which the summit was originally scheduled. 
In an open letter to Kim on Thursday, Trump canceled the planned meeting between the two leaders in Singapore next month, writing: “based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.” Earlier on Thursday, North Korea’s vice minister of foreign affairs called Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” after comments he made about North Korea on Monday.
On Friday, in response to Trump’s cancellation, North Korea released a statement saying it was still “willing to give the U.S. time and opportunities” to reconsider talks “at any time, at any format.” Trump called the North’s statement “good news” in a tweet, adding, “will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace.” To reporters outside the White House on Friday morning, he said, “everybody plays games.”
Pence’s comments on Monday
On Monday, Pence spoke about North Korea on Fox News, referring to comments made by National Security Adviser John Bolton in April. At that time, Bolton spoke about North Korean nuclear disarmament, saying the U.S. had “in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004.” In 2003, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi agreed to denuclearization in exchange for sanctions being lifted. Rebels overthrew and killed Gadhafi in 2011. Prior to Gadhafi’s death, NATO forces carried out an airstrike on Gadhafi’s convoy, and later said they did not know he was in it.
Last week, Trump said, “the Libyan model isn’t a model that we have at all when we’re thinking of North Korea.” He said, “In Libya we decimated that country,” adding, “There was no deal to keep Qaddafi.” Trump also said, “That model would take place if we don’t make a deal [with North Korea], most likely.”
Pence said on Fox News, ""There was some talk about the Libya model. As the President made clear, this will only end like the Libya model ended if Kim Jong Un doesn't make a deal."" When Fox News’ Martha MacCallum said some people may have taken Bolton's comments about the “Libya model” as a threat, Pence said ""I think it's more of a fact."" 
North Korea’s comments on Thursday
North Korea’s vice minister of foreign affairs Choe Sun Hui said Pence’s remarks comparing North Korea to Libya were “unbridled and imprudent.” She said, ""As a person involved in the U.S. affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president.” 
Hui also said, ""Whether the U.S. will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States.”
Hui said the U.S. asked for the dialogue with North Korea and “now it is misleading the public opinion as if we have invited them to sit with us.” In his letter to Kim, Trump said, “We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea, but that to us is totally irrelevant.”
Trump’s letter on Thursday
Trump wrote that he had been “very much” looking forward to meeting with Kim. He said, “the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place.""
Trump thanked Kim for the release of three American hostages earlier this month, calling it a “beautiful gesture” and “very much appreciated.” 
Trump ended the letter to Kim, saying, “If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write. The world, and North Korea in particular, has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth. This missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history.”

34930,2018-05-25,Investigators ‘convinced’ Russian brigade missile downed MH17 flight in 2014; Russia denies involvement,"On Thursday, an international Joint Investigation Team (JIT) examining the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) in eastern Ukraine in 2014 said it was “convinced” that the 53rd Russian anti-aircraft missile brigade had fired the Buk missile that reportedly caused the plane to go down. The JIT said its conclusion was based on “extensive comparative research” of images that identified characteristics of the particular Buk launcher. Russia has denied involvement of its armed forces in the plane crash. The JIT includes officials from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.
The downing of the MH17 flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in July 2014 killed 298 people from 17 countries. Russia and Ukraine were engaged in an armed conflict at the time, after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.
Fred Westerbeke, chief prosecutor of the National Prosecutor's Office of the Netherlands, said the Buk missile launcher ""was transported from the territory of the Russian Federation” and was returned to that territory afterwards. He said, ""at the time this area [of Ukraine] was under control of pro-Russian separatists.” 
The Russian defense ministry said, “Not a single anti-aircraft missile system from Russia has ever crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border.""
Westerbeke said, ""this raises questions such as to whether the brigade was actively involved in downing MH17. It is an important question which the JIT are still investigating."" The JIT called for witnesses to come forward to help identify people who may have operated the missile system.
Russia’s foreign ministry said the country had provided “sizeable amounts of information” to the JIT, including “technical and design data” on Buk missiles. The ministry also said it provided the JIT the “results of a full-scale experiment carried out by the producer of this type of air defense” weapon and “primary data received by a radar station operating in the area in question.” It added, ""No evidence has been presented [by the JIT] except for a colorful video based on information fabricated by bloggers from the Bellingcat agency, who were earlier caught distorting facts to prove Russia’s alleged involvement in the MH17 crash.” Russian state-run media outlet TASS did not report additional information on what the foreign ministry referred to when it said “distorting facts.”
Bellingcat is a U.K.-based organization that “uses open source and social media investigation to investigate a variety of subjects.”
Russia’s foreign ministry also said, “we will continue to assist the investigation seeking to establish the cause of the MH17 crash and ensure that those responsible face a just punishment.”
In October 2015, the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the plane had been downed by a Buk missile. In September 2016, the JIT issued a preliminary report saying it had “irrefutable evidence” that the missile had been brought from Russia and was fired from an area controlled by pro-Russian fighters.

34940,2018-05-25,Saudi Arabia releases 3 women’s rights activists arrested last week,"On Thursday, Amnesty International said Saudi Arabian authorities had released three women’s rights activists. At least seven other activists arrested last week are still detained. The three women released have advocated for additional freedoms for women in the kingdom, including abolishing the male guardianship system under which females cannot travel without the permission of a male relative.
Samah Hadid, Middle East director of campaigns at Amnesty International, said, ""We can confirm the release of Aisha al-Mana, Hessa al-Sheikh, and Madeha al-Ajroush, but we don't know the conditions behind it.” She added, ""We call on Saudi authorities to release all other human rights defenders unconditionally and immediately.""
Saudi Arabia arrested the women last week for “suspicious contact with foreign parties,” and providing financial support to some foreign groups, allegedly attempting to undermine the kingdom’s “security and stability.” State-affiliated media called the women “agents of embassies.”
Al-Mana, 70, has lobbied since the 1990s for women’s right to drive in Saudi Arabia. She holds a Ph.D. from a U.S. university, and is the director of the Al-Mana General Hospitals and the Mohammad Al-Mana College of Health Sciences. Al-Shekh is a professor at King Saud University, and this year co-authored a study on Saudi women’s advocacy. Al-Ajroush is a psychotherapist in her mid-60s, according to The Associated Press, and helped initiate a support program in Saudi Arabia for domestic abuse victims.
The activists still in custody, at least two of whom are men, could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison if found guilty, Al Jazeera reported.
The remaining detainees have been interrogated without access to lawyers, AP reported. Saudi authorities have allowed the activists to place one phone call to relatives. Loujain Al-Hathloul has not communicated with her family since authorities arrested her on May 15, according to AP. She was imprisoned for 72 days in 2014 for attempting to drive across the border from the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia.
Last September, Saudi Arabia said it would remove a ban on women driving on June 24.

35054,2018-05-26,"Explosive detonates in restaurant near Toronto, injures 15","Fifteen people were injured when a device was detonated Thursday evening at an Indian restaurant in the Canadian city of Mississauga, near Toronto. Authorities have not apprehended the suspects. 
Three people were taken to the hospital with critical injuries and have since been released. The remaining wounded were treated for minor injuries, according to Peel Regional Police. 
At the time of the attack, there were about 40 people in the Bombay Bhel Indian restaurant, attending two private parties. Police said two male suspects entered the restaurant at around 10:30 p.m., detonated the device and left the scene. The suspects are believed to have fled in a vehicle, Police Chief Jennifer Evans said.
The two suspects were seen on surveillance footage and investigators have asked for the public’s help to identify them. Evans said, “there's no indication this is a terrorist attack. There’s no indication this is a hate crime,” adding, “at this time, we haven't ruled anything out.""

35043,2018-05-26,Harvey Weinstein turns himself in for arrest in New York,"Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein turned himself in to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on Friday, was arrested and charged with two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree in a felony complaint. The charges relate to allegations from two women in separate incidents. Weinstein’s attorney Benjamin Brafman said his client entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment on Friday.
Weinstein, 66, was released after posting $1 million bail and surrendering his passport. He will be required to wear a GPS monitoring device and refrain from traveling outside of New York and Connecticut, the court ordered.
The criminal sex act charge against Weinstein relates to a 2004 incident involving former actress Lucia Evans, CNN reported. The rape charges relate to a 2013 incident with a woman whose name has been sealed under an order of protection, as agreed by both parties, prosecutors said. 
The maximum possible total sentence for these charges is 37 years in prison, according to Fox News.
Previous events
Articles published last October by The New York Times and The New Yorker reported on at least 13 women who accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct or harassment. He was subsequently fired from the film studio he co-founded, The Weinstein Company. 
On March 19 of this year, The Weinstein Company announced it would file for bankruptcy, and on May 1, the company announced Lantern Capital Partners had won the bid in its bankruptcy sale. Lantern acquired TWC for $310 million, assuming about $115 million of the company’s debt.
In total, more than 80 women have made public accusations against Weinstein, according to Fox News. Weinstein has said he “never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone,” according to Brafman.
After the public accusations against Weinstein, other “high-profile” men were publicly accused of sexual misconduct. The New York Times wrote an article in February listing 71 such men.

35046,2018-05-26,"Ireland votes to overturn constitutional ban on abortion, exit poll says","Ireland voted on Friday to overturn the country’s constitutional prohibition on abortion in a national referendum, according to exit poll results. Ireland’s constitution grants an “unborn” person the same right to life as a mother. Under this clause of the country’s Eighth Amendment, abortion is illegal in all cases except when a woman’s life is deemed to be in “real and substantial” risk due to the pregnancy. 

According to Irish media outlet RTE’s exit polls, the results were 69.4 percent in favor of the repeal, and 30.6 percent against it. Polls were open between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time on Friday. Votes will be officially counted on Saturday and a final result is expected Sunday. 
If the official results confirm a repeal of the Eighth Amendment, the vote would remove the constitutional restriction on abortion, but not automatically legalize abortion. Lawmakers in the Irish parliament, called the Oireachtas Éireann, would need to draft and vote on new legislative guidelines regulating abortion to make it legal under certain conditions. 
A current draft of legislation has proposed permitting abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or after the 12-week mark in cases where doctors determine the women’s health is at risk. If the country votes “no” on the referendum, the current law would remain in place. 
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who publicly supported the repeal, called the referendum a “once-in-a-generation decision.” The last referendum on the issue was 35 years ago. 
Abortion law background
After a referendum in 1983, Ireland changed its constitution to grant an “unborn” the same right to life as a mother. Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution says, “The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.” 
A high court ruled in 1986 that providing women with information about getting abortions outside of Ireland was unconstitutional, breaching the fetus’ equal right to life. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this decision in 1988. 
In 1992, Ireland’s Supreme Court ruled that a person should be permitted to travel outside the country to receive an abortion in cases where the pregnancy presents a “real and substantial risk” to a mother’s life, though this doesn’t apply with non-fatal health issues. The ruling overturned a High Court decision that restricted the freedom of movement of a 14-year-old girl who had been raped by a neighbor and attempted to travel to Britain to have an abortion. She was deemed a suicide risk. The attorney general at the time sought the injunction against the girl’s travel. 
In 1995, Ireland passed the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act, which outlined conditions under which information could be distributed to individuals or groups about abortion services that are available outside of Ireland. The Act did not require medical professionals to distribute information on foreign abortion services.
In 2013, the country passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act (PLDPA), which allowed abortion in cases in which at least two doctors consider there to be a “real and substantial risk of loss of the woman’s life from a physical illness” or “suicide” and in which that “risk can only be averted” by terminating the pregnancy.
The act was passed after the 2012 death of a 31-year-old woman, Savita Halappanavar, whose doctors declined to give her an abortion. Halappanavar, an Indian woman in Ireland, went to the hospital 17-weeks pregnant. Her doctors determined a miscarriage was “inevitable,” yet did not terminate the pregnancy. She died a few days later due to sepsis, a blood infection, and her husband claimed she may have lived if an abortion had been performed. 
Catholic population
About 78.3 percent of the approximately 4.75 million Irish citizens self-identified as Roman Catholic, according to a 2016 Census. That represents a decline of 5.9 percent since 2011, and a total decline of 13.3 percent in the past 25 years, according to census results. 
Pope Francis is scheduled to visit Ireland in August, the first time a pope will have visited there since 1979. In 2015, Pope Francis announced that all Catholic priests would be able to forgive the “sin of abortion” during the jubilee year, also known as the Holy Year or the Year of Mercy, from December 2015 to November 2016. In the Catholic Church, the “sin of abortion” is punishable by excommunication and in most countries the punishment can only be overturned by a bishop. In some countries, including Britain, Canada, Scotland and the U.S., bishops have delegated authority to priests to absolve the sin.
The Catholic Catechism states that “human life is sacred” and “must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception.” 
Irish referendums on other social issues
Ireland has previously decided the legality of other social issues by referendum. In 1995, Ireland voted 50.3 to 49.8 percent in favor of legalizing divorce. At the time it was the only European nation where divorce was illegal. 
In 2015, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage, after a 62 to 38 percent vote in a referendum.

35253,2018-05-28,"One missing during flash flood in Ellicott City, Maryland","Flash flooding in Ellicott City, Maryland, on Sunday left one National Guard member missing after he was caught in fast-moving floodwaters, according to his family and officials. On Sunday, Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency in Maryland. As of Monday morning, no deaths or injuries were reported from the floods. 
On Monday morning, emergency workers conducted 30 rescue operations to search for the guardsman, 39-year-old Eddison Hermond, who was reported missing around 12:30 a.m. Hermond had been rescuing people from flooding as of 4 p.m. Sunday afternoon, Fox News said, citing relatives.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for southeastern Howard County on Sunday. Between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, more than 8 inches of rain fell in areas of Ellicott City, which is about 12 miles west of Baltimore. Floodwaters rose to the second story of buildings in some areas of the city, CNN reported. 
Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said a 25-to 30-foot-wide hole formed in one of the roads, due to the weight of the flooding. 
The Patapsco River rose 17.8 feet in a two hour period on Sunday, according to CNN, to a new record high of 24.1 feet.
Electric and gas services have been disconnected along Main Street. Baltimore Gas  a community center is open for residents who need shelter.
2016 flash flood
Ellicott City last experienced flash flooding in 2016. The flood, which followed 6 inches of rain in a 90 minute period, caused an estimated $23 million in damage.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided funds to help repair the damage. Earlier this month, FEMA granted an additional $1 million in funds allocated to upgrade water infrastructure, improve public safety and provide added insurance against water damage for local businesses.  
Flash floods occur within six hours, usually three hours, of heavy rainfall or other cause (such as a dam breaking), according to the National Weather Service’s definition.

35195,2018-05-28,Woman says Echo device sent private conversation to phone contact; Amazon issues explanation,"A woman named Danielle in Portland, Oregon, said one of her Amazon Echo Dot devices had, without her knowledge, recorded a conversation she had in her home with her husband and sent it to the phone of one of her husband’s employees. She said the employee called her and her husband about the recording, saying he heard them discussing hardwood floors. Amazon issued a statement describing an “unlikely … string of events” to explain the incident.
According to Amazon’s website, the Echo Dot smart speaker is a hands-free, voice-controlled device with a built-in speaker “that uses Alexa [voice assistant] to play music, control smart home devices, make calls, send and receive messages, provide information … and more.” When the device hears its “wake word,” set to “Alexa” by default, it begins sending incoming audio to a cloud-based computing system that records and processes it to recognize what is being said. A light ring at the top of the cylindrical device indicates when it is recording. The company said a unit does not record audio until it hears the “wake word.”
After Danielle was informed of the recorded conversation, the family disconnected its Echo devices and notified Amazon of what had happened.
In a statement on Thursday, Amazon offered the following points regarding the incident: “Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like ‘Alexa.’ Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a ‘send message’ request. At which point, Alexa said out loud ‘To whom?’ At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer’s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, ‘[contact name], right?’ Alexa then interpreted background conversation as ‘right’.” 
Amazon added, “As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.”
Danielle later told KIRO7, a Seattle-based television news station, that one of the Echo units was next to her with the volume set to seven out of 10 at the time of the conversation. She said she did not hear the device ask permission to send the audio.
Amazon offered to refund Danielle for her five Echo Dots after she requested it, KIRO7 reported.
Last month, Amazon said it fixed a separate issue with Echo devices after researchers found that developers could make an Echo continue to listen to conversations after users woke Alexa; if people did not see the device’s light ring light up, they would not know it continued recording. The Checkmarx researchers said the issue was resolved by Amazon as of April 10, CNET reported.
Amazon provides instructions on its website for reviewing and deleting audio recorded by Echo devices. The company said, “When you use an Alexa device, we keep the voice recordings associated with your account to improve the accuracy of the results provided to you and to improve our services. If you delete these recordings, it may degrade your experience using voice features.”

35192,2018-05-28,"North, South Korean leaders hold unannounced meeting in DMZ","On Saturday, South Korean President Moon Jae In and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held an unannounced in-person meeting in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries. The second meeting, following their first on April 27, was requested by Kim, according to The Korea Times. The leaders met from 3 to 5 p.m. in the village of Panmunjeom on the North Korean side of the DMZ. Moon and Kim “reached a satisfactory consensus on the matters discussed,” North Korea’s state news agency KCNA reported.

35288,2018-05-29,A recent timeline of US trade relations,"Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has announced changes to its trade policies, including new tariffs, and is currently negotiating with trading partners. We’ve selected highlights of developments in recent months:

	Aug 16, 2017: The U.S., Mexico and Canada begin talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Representing the three countries are U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland. 
	Jan. 22, 2018: President Donald Trump approves tariffs on imported solar panel components and washing machines. This includes a 30 percent tariff on imported solar modules and a 20 percent tariff applied to the first 1.2 million washing machines imported in the first year and a 50 percent tariff on subsequent imports.
	March 1: Trump announces global tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. He signs an executive order authorizing the tariffs on March 8, to take effect later in the month. 
	March 22: Trump instructs the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to consider increasing tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump said the tariffs “could be about $60 billion.” Later that day, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced plans to impose tariffs on about $3 billion worth of 128 American products.
	March 23: The U.S. implements tariffs of 25 percent on steel products and 10 percent on aluminum products with temporary exemptions, originally extending until April 30, for Canada, Mexico, the EU, Australia, Argentina and Brazil.
	March 28: The U.S. and South Korea announce an agreement “in principle” on “general terms” for amending the 2012 U.S.-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). A joint statement by the countries said the agreement “addresses issues related to investment, tariffs, trade in automobiles, and trade remedies.” 
	April 2: China implements tariffs on $2.97 billion worth of U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, pork, and more than 100 other American products.
	April 3: The USTR proposes a 25 percent tariff on a list of about 1,300 categories of goods imported from China, totaling about $50 billion per year.
	April 16: The U.S. prohibits American companies from selling to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp., for seven years. The company admits it had “illegally shipped U.S.-origin items to Iran, obstructed justice and made a material false statement.” The U.S. Commerce Department said the ban was “a regulatory action and is unrelated to any ongoing trade-related actions.”
	April 17: China announces a temporary 178.6 percent deposit for Chinese importers to pay on purchases of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and to make alcohol. The aim of the deposit was to correct “unfair trade practices,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce director said, such as “dumping,” which is when companies export a product at a lower price than is normally charged in that market in order to eliminate competitors.
	April 19: Russia asks the World Trade Organization for “consultations” with the U.S. regarding the steel and aluminum tariffs. India, China and the EU had earlier petitioned the WTO for similar tariff consultations with the U.S. Consultations allow member states to discuss a complaint and “to find a satisfactory solution without resorting to litigation.” 
	April 30: The Trump administration extends the temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs, originally implemented on March 23, until June 1.
	May 20: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says the U.S. and China have put tariffs “on hold.” According to a joint statement, China will “significantly increase” its purchases of U.S. goods and services. The U.S. had a goods trade deficit with China of $375 billion in 2017.
	May 22: China’s Finance Ministry says it will reduce tariffs on U.S. imported cars from 25 to 15 percent of the wholesale price, and reduce tariffs on car parts to 6 percent across the board (from the current 6 to 25 percent, depending on the type).
	May 25: The U.S. administration agrees to lift its ban on ZTE Corp. under the conditions the company fire its management team, hire American compliance officers and pay a fine. 
	May 29: The U.S. announces it will implement 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese products, “related to the acquisition of industrially significant technology,” according to the White House. The tariffs will go into effect after a list of specific products is announced on June 15, the White House says. Also, the U.S., Mexico and Canada plan to continue NAFTA talks. 
	Anticipated June 2-4: U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to meet with officials in China to discuss trade relations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed.

35302,2018-05-29,"Virginia Rep. Garrett says he is an alcoholic, will not seek re-election","On Sunday, Rep. Thomas Garrett (R-Va.) announced he is an alcoholic and will not seek re-election. In his video statement outside the Virginia State Capitol, Garrett said, anyone “who's known me for any period of time and has any integrity, knows two things: I am a good man and I am an alcoholic.” “With this in mind,” he said, “I am announcing that I will not seek re-election.”
Garrett called his admission to alcoholism the “hardest statement” he had ever publicly made. He said in an interview that he never drank during the day and would drink, after work, to his “own detriment.”
Garrett, 46, was originally elected to Congress in 2016 representing Virginia’s 5th District and has been a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. He is a former state senator, an Army veteran and previously worked as an attorney. 
He had been nominated to seek another term and had confirmed last Thursday he would run again. Given Sunday’s announcement that Garrett will not seek re-election, the 5th Congressional District Republican Committee will choose a new nominee. 
Other events last week
On Friday, a Politico article cited four former staffers who said Garrett and his wife had used congressional staff for “tasks that were unofficial and personal in nature,” such as running errands — a violation of House Ethics rules. In his video announcement, Garrett said the accusations were “a series of half-truths and whole lies” and that he could prove it. 
On Tuesday, Garrett’s chief of staff, Jimmy Keady resigned.

35285,2018-05-29,"US authorities unable to confirm whereabouts of 1,500 immigrant children, report says","Over the weekend, news outlets reported that U.S. federal authorities were unable to confirm the whereabouts of 1,500 immigrant children. The story was based on a report the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department gave to a Senate subcommittee last month. The HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) reported on the unaccompanied alien children program, which is responsible for the care and placement of children who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or guardian. 
The report said that during “safety and well-being calls” to 7,635 children and their sponsors from October to December last year, the agency “was unable to determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 children.” The 7,635 well-being calls found that 52 children were living in the care of someone else, eight had run away and five had been deported.
The report also said the “long-standing interpretation” of the law has been that ORR was not “legally responsible” for children after they are released to their sponsors, adding that the ORR is “taking a fresh look at that question as a matter of both legal interpretation and appropriate policy.” 
The office is “exploring the question of ORR’s responsibilities … and whether the level of responsibility would differ depending on the child’s relationship to his or her sponsor,” the report said. Approximately 85 percent of sponsors are parents or family members, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told The Washington Post. 
The ORR report was presented on April 26 to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a subgroup of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families spoke before the committee.
Separating immigrant children from adults
As a separate matter, some children also arrive at the U.S. border with adults who are illegally entering the U.S. The current DHS policy can result in immigrant children being separated from these adults upon entry into the U.S.
On May 7, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the DHS would refer “100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution.” He also said, “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.” Children are prohibited from being put in criminal jails, The Washington Post reported; adults who are prosecuted may be separated from children they are accompanying. 
If children are separated from detained adults, Immigration and Customs Enforcement will transfer them to the ORR, according to AP. In 2017, children stayed in ORR custody for 51 days on average, before being placed with sponsors.

35426,2018-05-30,Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens announces he’ll resign as of June 1,"On Tuesday, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) announced he would resign, effective June 1. His resignation followed two reports on Greitens’ behavior released by a special investigative committee in the state House. One report detailed accusations that he mistreated a woman with whom he admitted to having an affair. A second was on allegations he improperly used a charity donor list for political fundraising. He said, “I am not perfect, but I have not broken any laws.”
Greitens said the “ordeal has been designed to cause an incredible amount of strain on my family. Millions of dollars in mounting legal bills, endless personal attacks designed to cause maximum damage to family and friends.” He said he had not “committed any offense worthy of this treatment.” 
“It's clear for the forces that oppose us, there's no end in sight,” Greitens said. “I cannot allow those forces to continue to cause pain and difficulty to the people that I love.” He also said he will “always be a fighter for the people of Missouri.”
In January, the woman who he had an affair with in 2015 said he had taken a nude photo of her without her permission and said he would release it publicly if she told anyone about the affair. A St. Louis grand jury indicted him in February on a felony count of invasion of privacy. The St. Louis prosecutor later dropped the charge.
In April, Greitens was charged with a second felony, computer tampering, relating to his allegedly using a charity donor list for political purposes before the 2016 election. Greitens denied any criminal wrongdoing.
Greitens, 44, is a former Navy SEAL who became governor of Missouri in January 2017. Mike Parson, 63, a Republican who became lieutenant governor in 2017, will take over as governor to serve out Greitens’ term until 2021.

35406,2018-05-30,"Canada to buy Kinder Morgan pipeline for $4.5bn Canadian, says will proceed with pipeline expansion","The Canadian government said Tuesday it would buy the Trans Mountain pipeline for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars from Houston-based energy company Kinder Morgan. The pipeline transports oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to a port near Vancouver, British Columbia. Kinder Morgan had originally planned to start work this summer on a $7.4 billion pipeline expansion, which the company has currently placed on hold due to pending litigation. Kinder Morgan shareholders must approve the agreement for the sale to proceed. 
The province of Alberta has supported the pipeline expansion, while the province of British Columbia (B.C.) has opposed it, citing environmental concerns. Environmental and indigenous groups have protested the pipeline, resulting in dozens of arrests. 
Last month, B.C. filed a case with the provincial Court of Appeals, asking the court to determine whether the province has the legal right to limit oil shipment to its coast. The case is “to confirm the scope and extent of provincial powers to regulate environmental and economic risks related to heavy oils like diluted bitumen,” British Columbia Attorney General David Eby said.
After that, Kinder Morgan said it would suspend non-essential spending on the Trans Mountain pipeline and that it would stop its planned expansion if B.C. did not end its legal attempts to block it by Thursday, May 31.
Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the planned purchase of the pipeline two days before the deadline Kinder Morgan gave for B.C. to drop its attempt to block the project. The agreement is intended as a short-term purchase agreement, and Morneau said government planned to sell the pipeline to the private sector after its expansion was complete. A senior government official cited by CBC said the federal government hopes to find a new commercial buyer for the pipeline by August, adding that the federal government would provide the $4.5 billion in purchase funds if a new buyer was not found by then.  
“The Trans Mountain expansion project is of vital interest to Canada and Canadians,” Morneau said while announcing the agreement. “Our government’s position is clear: It must be built and it will be built.” Morneau called it “an investment in Canada’s future.” He added that the decision will “reassure investors that Canada respects the rule of law and gets big, important things done.” He said the government would support the project for the workers “counting on it” for the summer construction season.
Kinder Morgan CEO Steve Kean said of the agreement, “the outcome we have reached represents the best opportunity to complete” the expansion project and realize the “great national economic benefits promised by” it. He added, “Our Canadian employees and contractors … will now resume work in executing this important Canadian project.”
Response to the deal
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted, “Today, we've taken action to create and protect jobs in Alberta and B.C., and restart construction on the TMX pipeline expansion, a vital project in the national interest.”
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said, “pipeline spills are less and less frequent,” and “the technology around new pipelines is improving every day.” She added, “Just as with any kind of project, there is risk. The risk is very low here.”
Jagmeet Singh, leader of the federal NDP party, said the government’s proposed purchase was a “bad deal that will solve nothing.” He added, “Climate change leaders don't spend $4.5 billion dollars on pipelines.”
The planned expansion
Kinder Morgan’s planned pipeline expansion involves building a second pipeline to run alongside 609 miles (980 km) of the 715 mile-long (1,150 km) Trans Mountain pipeline, which opened in 1953. The expansion would increase its total capacity from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels of oil per day.
The construction and first 20 years of operation of the expanded pipeline would result in estimated revenue of $5.7 billion for British Columbia, $19.4 billion for Alberta and $21.6 billion for the rest of Canada, according to Kinder Morgan.

35400,2018-05-30,Israel bombs more than 35 sites in Gaza after 28 rockets fired into Israel,"After 28 rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel on Tuesday morning, the Israeli military bombed more than 35 Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza by plane. No deaths were reported in either attack. Israel said “most” of the mortars from Gaza were intercepted by its Iron Dome aerial defense system, and that three soldiers were wounded. Al-Qassam Brigades and al-Quds Brigades, divisions of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad Palestinian groups, claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks from Gaza.
At least 121 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during protests that started on March 30, according to Al Jazeera. Palestinians have protested for the “right to return” to Israel for people whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted the “right to return.” The majority of the Palestinians killed were shot by Israeli snipers after the protesters approached the Gaza border fence. Israel also used tear gas on protesters. Israel has said its forces have “operated in accordance with the rules of engagement” to protect its border.
On Sunday, an Israeli tank fired on a Islamic Jihad observation post and killed three people, according to Al Jazeera. Islamic Jihad said, “we know how to respond to this dangerous escalation.”
Al-Qassam and al-Quds said their “joint response” of rocket attacks from Gaza on the “occupation’s military positions … is a declaration, that these crimes cannot be tolerated in any way.” They said Israel's “aggression against our people” was “an attempt to shift attention away from the crimes it carried out against our peaceful civilians.”
Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tweeted: “No country in the world would or should accept such threats to its civilian population. Neither do we.”
On Monday, the Israeli military killed a Palestinian it said approached the Gaza border fence with Israel. Also on Monday, machine-gun fire from Gaza hit buildings in the Israeli city of Sderot. Over the weekend, Palestinians cut through the Gaza fence and set an empty Israeli military post on fire. In response, Israeli airplanes bombed a Hamas military compound.
Hamas is a political organization with an armed division that governs the Gaza territories. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement is a militant organization whose aim is to eliminate Israel from the region, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Israel and the U.S. have described Hamas and Islamic Jihad as a terrorist organizations.

35497,2018-05-31,Greek workers strike over austerity measures,"Thousands of Greek workers went on strike on Wednesday for 24 hours to protest austerity measures implemented in exchange for international debt relief. More than 10,000 workers, students, pensioners and unemployed people protested in front of the parliament in Athens around noon, Reuters reported. 

Air traffic controllers also held a three hour work stoppage, leading flights to be canceled or rescheduled. Bus and trolley service was running at reduced capacity, and some ships were unable to sail. Journalists for state and private television stations also went on strike; the stations aired documentaries instead of news. 
The two largest labor unions — the private sector GSEE and public sector ADEDY — organized the strikes, and other unions joined. A representative for the PAME union, Nikos Papageorgiou, said workers were demanding higher salaries and “basic human rights for workers.""
In parts of Athens, protesters and police briefly fought, Al Jazeera reported. No deaths were reported.
Greece has received 260 billion euros ($302 billion) in total from three debt relief packages from the European Central Bank (ECB) and IMF. As part of the deals reached in 2010, 2012 and 2015, Greece agreed to impose austerity measures including eliminating public sector jobs, reducing pensions and increasing taxes.
The Greek parliament is scheduled to vote on a new set of austerity measures during its June 14 session. The bill would include selling portions of the state-owned energy industry. 
Eurozone ministers are scheduled to meet on June 21. Greece will ask the ministers to approve the new austerity measures, AFP reported. If approved, the new measures would take effect after the current debt relief package expires on August 20. 
Nearly 50 general strikes have been held since 2010 over the economic situation in Greece, according to AFP. 
Greek economy
Greece entered an economic recession about a decade ago, during the global economic recession of 2009. Real GDP contracted 9.1 percent in 2011, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures. Last year, the economy grew 1.4 percent and growth is estimated to reach 2 percent this year, the IMF forecasted. 
Greece’s unemployment rate was 21.5 percent last year, and youth unemployment is at 43.7 percent.

35512,2018-05-31,"Trump criticizes Democratic candidate, Pelosi at Tennessee rally","At a Nashville rally on Tuesday for Republican Senate candidate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, President Donald Trump criticized her opponent, Democrat Phil Bredesen. Trump said Bredesen was “an absolute, total tool” of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and a “tool” of “the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi,” who is the House minority leader from California.
Earlier this month, Trump referred to MS-13 gang members as “animals,” and some media reports characterized his comments as referring more generally to illegal immigrants. Pelosi said of Trump’s comments, ""Calling people animals is not a good thing.” She asked, “you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity? In the dignity and worth of every person?” 
What’s MS-13? Read our Context piece. 
Bredesen is a former Tennessee governor and Nashville mayor who last ran for public office in 2006. He and Blackburn are running to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).
Trump said Bredesen had donated to Barack Obama’s presidential campaign and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “Bredesen supported her and he supported her ideas,” he said. 
About the Republican candidate Blackburn, Trump said we “need” her in the Senate to “continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half.” Trump also said, “When you win the presidency, for some reason, you always end up losing the House.” He said it “makes absolutely no sense, but I think what happens is you get complacent.” 
“This election is a very important one,” he added. “So you have to get out. We need Marsha Blackburn to win.” 
In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Tennessee with 61 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 35 percent. 
A total of 33 Senate seats will be on the ballot in the November midterm elections, according to Ballotpedia. The Senate is currently controlled by 51 Republicans, and has 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats. 
Trump also spoke about his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying, ""I don't want to cause a problem but in the end Mexico is going to pay for the wall.” He said, “They make all of this money and they do nothing to stop people coming through Mexico from Honduras and all these countries. They do nothing. They are going to pay for the wall and they are going to enjoy it, okay?” Trump may have been referring to the caravan of people, some of them seeking asylum in the U.S., who traveled from Honduras and other countries through Mexico to the U.S. border in April. 
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto tweeted after the event, “President @realDonaldTrump: NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us).”
Trump also spoke about other topics at the rally, including tax reform, jobs and wages, the U.S. moving its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) voting against a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, African Americans voting for Democrats, and “phenomenal” health care plans to be released. The president mentioned “people infiltrating our campaign,” likely in reference to an FBI informant contacting members of his presidential campaign to investigate alleged contacts with Russians, according to The New York Times. 
An estimated 5,500 people attended the Nashville rally, according to the local fire marshal. Tennessee primaries are scheduled for Aug. 2.

35500,2018-05-31,US to allow drug companies to provide experimental drugs to terminally ill,"On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed the “Right to Try bill” to allow certain experimental drugs to be made available to terminally ill patients. The bill also limits the liability of experimental drug manufacturers and distributors who provide or decline to provide the drugs. The bill had passed the Senate last August, and passed the House 250-169 on May 22.
The terminally ill patients must have “exhausted approved treatment options” and be “unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the drugs” in order to receive the experimental drugs through this legislation. 
Trump said it was an “honor” to sign the bill. He had said in his State of the Union Address this year that the terminally ill should not have to travel “from country to country to seek a cure.” Some Democrats have said the Right to Try program would give patients “false hope.” 
According to righttotry.org, Right to Try laws currently exist in 40 states. The 10 states that do not have such laws are Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. 
Under the new bill, in order for an experimental drug to be prescribed, it must have passed phase one Food and Drug Administration (FDA) testing and continue to be under consideration by the FDA for approval. To pass the first phase of testing, the drug must not cause human fatalities in limited clinical trials. Experimental or “investigative” drug approvals can take years.
Current FDA ‘compassionate use’ program
The FDA currently allows access to experimental drugs under its “compassionate use” program. Such approval generally takes about four days, according to The Associated Press, and can be given over the phone immediately in emergency situations. The FDA grants about 1,200 “compassionate use” drug applications per year, according to righttotry.org. More than one million people die from terminal illnesses each year in the U.S. 
Current FDA “compassionate use” approval sometimes comes with recommendations on drug use. About 10 percent of the requests received by the FDA have come back with recommendations for using the drug more safely or noting side effects to watch for, according to Dr. Steven Joffe, a professor in medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. 
The FDA approved about 99 percent of applications for “compassionate use” of about 9,000 experimental drugs from January 2005 through December 2014, according to a study published in 2016 in the journal Therapeutic Innovation  Regulatory Science. 
The new legislation would eliminate the need for this FDA approval before experimental drugs could be dispensed to the terminally ill.

35494,2018-05-31,Ukraine security service says it faked Russian journalist’s death,"The Ukraine security service said on Wednesday it had faked the murder of Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, who had been reported shot dead in Kiev the day before. On Wednesday, Babchenko apologized, and said the planning of his fake murder had been ongoing for two months. The security service said it had received reports of possible attempts on Babchenko’s life and used the faked murder to collect evidence and prevent his actual murder. 
Ukraine Prosecutor General, Larisa Sarga said two people were in custody after the fake murder operation.  
On Tuesday, Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform had reported Babchenko, 41, was shot in the back and died in an ambulance on the way to a hospital. Ukrainian police said he was shot three times as he left his apartment to buy bread. 
Speaking at a Wednesday news conference about his faked death, Babchenko said, “I have been forced to bury my friends and colleagues many times and I know the sickening feeling.” He added, “Special apologies to my wife, Olechka, there was no other option.” Babchenko did not say who was aware of the plan.
The head of the Ukraine security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, said a Ukrainian citizen was attempting to pay for Babchenko’s murder. Hrytsak said the Ukrainian suspect was acting on behalf of Russian security services and offered $30,000 for someone to kill Babchenko. Hrytsak said one of the people that the suspect talked to in an attempt to solicit a paid assassination later informed authorities. 
Hrytsak said security services had arrested the Ukrainian who was offering money for Babchenko’s killing. The Ukraine security service later said the man had transferred a $15,000 deposit for the killing. 
The security service did not say how its fake murder operation led to the arrest of the two people. It is possible that one was arrested with the money transfer as evidence.
The Russian foreign ministry said the faked murder was done for “propagandistic effect,” and that it was happy to hear that Babchenko was alive, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted, ""It is unlikely that Moscow will calm down. I've given an order to provide Arkady and his family with protection.”
Babchenko left Russia in 2017 after a negative response to a post he made on social media criticizing Russia’s military actions in Syria. He has also criticized Russia’s military actions eastern Ukraine. According to The Guardian, there have been multiple journalists who have been killed in recent years in Kiev and whose murders remain unsolved.

35592,2018-06-01,"At least 11 people killed, 79 injured during Wednesday’s Nicaragua protests","National police said 15 people were killed during anti-government protests in Nicaragua on Wednesday. José Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watch’s Americas director, tweeted that 11 people were killed and 79 were injured. Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the capital of Managua in the “Mother of All Marches,” led by the mothers of some of the 83 people who have been killed since mid-April in protests over the president’s decree of social security reforms. Wednesday was Mother’s Day in Nicaragua.
Francisco Díaz, second-in-command at the national police, said Wednesday’s violence was due to “criminal gangs.” Pro-government forces fired on some protesters, according to activists. Some demonstrators with homemade bottle-rocket launchers fired at pro-government forces, The Associated Press reported.
At a Wednesday counter-rally, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said, “We want peace for all Nicaraguan families, security for all Nicaraguan families,” according to El 19, a state-controlled newspaper.
Protests began in mid-April after Ortega’s reforms were announced. On April 18, the government said it planned to decrease pension payments by five percent, increase worker social security contributions by 0.75 percent, and increase employer social security contributions by 3.5 percent. The government said the social security system would be insolvent and without liquid assets by 2019 if the measures were not implemented. On April 22, Ortega announced the government would not go through with the planned reforms.
Some television news outlets were reportedly taken off the air during April 19 protests. Protesters have called for Ortega’s resignation, citing the violence against demonstrators.
Nicaragua’s Catholic church had been mediating peace talks between Ortega and student-led protesters since May 16. On Thursday, the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua said it was suspending talks while violence continued.
Ortega was president in the 1980s and has again served in that role since 2007, having been re-elected in 2006, 2011 and 2016. His wife, Rosario Murillo, was elected vice president in 2016.

35590,2018-06-01,Italy announces coalition government formed; Giuseppe Conte to be prime minister,"Italy’s secretary of the presidential palace announced Tuesday that President Sergio Mattarella had appointed Giuseppe Conte as prime minister. Mattarella also approved a list of cabinet ministers from Conte. Conte withdrew his bid for prime minister last week after Mattarella had appointed him and rejected Conte’s nominee for finance minister.
Mattarella had appointed Carlo Cottarelli, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, to form an interim government earlier this week until a coalition government could be formed. Cottarelli resigned as interim prime minister for Conte to become prime minister. Conte has no political experience and is a law professor who lives in Florence. 
The new government will be comprised of a coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement parties, which formed after March 4 parliamentary elections. It is the longest amount of time it has taken to form a government after elections in the post-World War II-era, according to CNN.
The new government could be sworn in on Friday and could hold a confidence vote in parliament, possibly next week.
Conte had originally chosen Paolo Savona as finance minister. Savona, 81, has called Italy’s decision to adopt the euro as its currency a “historic error.” Mattarella rejected Savona’s nomination, saying there would be too much variation in economic markets if he were finance minister. 
Conte’s new cabinet is to be composed of economics professor Giovanni Tria as finance minister. Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, would become industry and labor minister, and Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, would become interior minister. Di Maio and Salvini would also be deputy prime ministers. Savona would become minister of European affairs. 
Other new ministers include: Enzo Moavero Milanesi as foreign minister, Elisabetta Trenta as defense minister, Alfonso Bonafede as justice minister, and Giulia Grillo as health minister.

35582,2018-06-01,Denmark passes law banning face coverings,"On Thursday, Denmark’s parliament passed a law that prohibits face coverings in public starting Aug. 1, except when there is a “recognizable purpose,” such as for cold weather or motorcycle helmets. Under the law, police can order women to remove face coverings such as veils, burqas or niqabs, order them to leave public places, and impose fines of 1,000 Danish crowns ($160) for a first offense, and up to 10,000 crowns plus up to six months in jail for repeat offenses.
The Danish parliament voted 75-30 for the law, with 74 absentees.
Søren Pape Poulsen, the conservative party leader in the governing coalition, said face coverings in public are “incompatible with the values of Danish society or respect for the community.” Amnesty International called the banning of face coverings in public “a discriminatory violation of women’s rights ... All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs.”
A burqa is a garment that covers the face and body, and has a mesh over the eye area. A niqab is a head and face covering with an opening for the eyes. Hijabs, head and neck coverings that leave the face exposed, would be legal under the law.
Other areas of Europe with legal restrictions on face coverings in public include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands and the state of Bavaria in Germany.

35588,2018-06-01,"US imposes 25% steel, 10% aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico, EU starting June 1","Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday the U.S. would let its temporary steel and aluminum tariff waivers for the EU, Canada and Mexico expire at midnight. The expiration would result in the U.S. imposing a tariff of 25 percent on steel and of 10 percent on aluminum starting Friday. The EU said it would react in a “proportionate … manner.” Mexico said it would impose “equivalent measures.” Canada announced tariffs on U.S. imports to begin July 1. 
The EU said it would bring legal proceedings against the U.S. to the World Trade Organization (WTO). It also said, “The level of tariffs to be applied [on U.S. imports] will reflect the damage caused by the new U.S. trade restrictions on E.U. products.” The EU had previously said it would respond to U.S. metal tariffs with 25 percent tariffs on U.S. products such as cigarettes, cranberry juice, denim, motorcycles and peanut butter.
Canada announced it would impose “dollar-for-dollar” tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods imported from the U.S. at rates of 25 and 10 percent, beginning July 1. It said the tariffs would apply to imports worth 16.6 billion Canadian dollars ($12.8 billion), which is the value of Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. last year. Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said the tariffs would remain in place until the U.S. removed its tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. She said Canada would legally challenge the U.S. tariffs at the WTO and under NAFTA.
Mexico’s Ministry of Economy said, “Faced with tariffs imposed by the U.S., Mexico will impose equivalent measures on various products such as flat steel (hot and cold laminate, including coated and various tubes), lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, blueberries, various cheeses, among others, up to an amount comparable to the level of affectation.”
The U.S. imposed the metal tariffs under a 1962 law that allows it to do so when it is in the interest of national security. The U.S. exempted Canada, Mexico and the EU until April 30, while it imposed the tariffs on other countries on March 23. It later renewed those exemptions until June 1.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “Canada is a secure supplier of aluminum and steel to the U.S. defense industry, putting aluminum in American planes and steel in American tanks. That Canada could be considered a national security threat to the United States is inconceivable.”
Ross said, “We take the view that without a strong economy, you can’t have strong national security.” Ross also said the tariffs proposed by its trade partners in response to the U.S.’s aluminum and steel tariffs would amount to a “fraction of one percent” of the U.S.’s $18 trillion economy.
Tariffs between the U.S., Canada and Mexico had been under discussion as part of NAFTA renegotiations. Ross said those negotiations “are taking longer than we hoped.” He also said the U.S. “look[s] forward” to continued trade negotiations, “both with Canada and Mexico on the one hand and with the European Commission on the other hand, because there are other issues that we also need to get resolved.”
The U.S. had previously granted metal tariff exemptions to Argentina, Australia and Brazil. The U.S. has reached deals with those countries to impose quotas on metal imports from them, The New York Times reported.

35706,2018-06-02,North Korea-US meeting no longer canceled; Trump and Kim to meet June 12 in Singapore,"On Friday, President Donald Trump said he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. Before his announcement, Trump met with North Korean Gen. Kim Yong Chol in the Oval Office. The meeting lasted more than one hour, during which Gen. Kim gave Trump a personal letter from Kim Jong Un. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were also in attendance. Trump said it was a ""getting-to-know-you-plus meeting” with a discussion about “a lot of things,” including ending the Korean War between North and South Korea. 
Kim Yong Chol is North Korea's former military intelligence chief and an advisor to Kim Jong Un. Kim Yong Chol was present at the April 27 inter-Korea meeting between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Trump and Kim Jong Un had originally scheduled the June 12 meeting on May 10 and Trump cancelled it on May 24, writing to Kim Jong Un it would be “inappropriate” to meet “based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement.” Earlier that day, North Korea’s vice minister of foreign affairs had said, “I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of” Vice President Mike Pence. She also called him a “political dummy.” Pence had made comments comparing North Korea to Libya on May 7.

35760,2018-06-03,Spanish PM receives vote of no confidence; leader of Spanish Socialist Workers' Party to assume office,"On Friday, Mariano Rajoy, prime minister of Spain and leader of the Popular Party (PP), received a vote of no confidence, requiring him to step down as prime minister. Of the 350 Members of Parliament (MPs), 180 voted for no confidence, 169 voted against, and one abstained. Pedro Sánchez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), filed the confidence motion after former members of Rajoy’s party were convicted on corruption-related charges. Rajoy himself has not been accused of wrongdoing.
Because Sánchez filed the confidence motion and received a parliamentary majority, his party must be prepared to govern and fill the role of prime minister, according to Spain’s constitution. Sánchez is expected to take office, according to BBC and CNN.
Rajoy, 63, has been prime minister since 2011. Sánchez said Rajoy did not take responsibility for the PP’s involvement in corruption offenses. Last week, the party was fined after a Spanish court ruled it had benefited from receiving bribes. The court also sentenced one of the PP’s former treasurers, Luis Bárcenas, to 33 years in prison after being convicted of receiving bribes, money laundering and tax crimes. He was one of 38 defendants in the case, code-named Gürtel. In addition to Bárcenas, 27 other people were found guilty and given prison sentences, while eight were acquitted. Rajoy was called to testify against his own party members in the case. He has not been personally accused of any crime.
Rajoy spoke to parliament before the vote, saying, “In light of what we all know, I presume that the vote of no confidence will go ahead, and Pedro Sánchez will become the Prime Minister and I want to be the first to congratulate him.”
“It has been an honor to leave Spain better than I found it. Thank you to all Spaniards and good luck,” he said.
Sánchez posted on Twitter, saying, ""Spain starts a new page. A period to recover the dignity of its institutions. From responsibility, dialogue and consensus, it is time to work for equality, to build a country that does not leave anyone behind."" 
Sánchez, 46, became leader of the PSOE in 2014 and resigned in 2016. In 2017, he won the PSOE primary. His party holds 84 seats in Spain’s lower house and will need support from other parties to pass legislation. Sánchez does not hold a seat in parliament.

35896,2018-06-04,"Suicide bomb attack in Kabul kills 7, injures 9","On Monday, a suicide bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed seven people and injured nine, according to police. The attack took place at a meeting of the Afghan Ulema Council, a religious council of clerics appointed by the president, held to discuss fighting between the government and the Taliban. No group claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack and the Taliban denied involvement, according to Reuters.
Monday’s explosion occurred near the entrance of the traditional tent of the Loya Jirga, or the Grand Council tent, where the clerics were meeting. There were about 2,000 clerics attending the meeting. 
The clerics had called on the government and Taliban to stop fighting and begin peace negotiations. The Taliban, which was overthrown from power in 2001 by U.S.-led troops, has been fighting to return Afghanistan to Islamic rule. The Ulema Council had also issued a fatwa (Islamic ruling) that said suicide attacks are haram (forbidden under Islamic law). 
Before the attack, a member of the council had read a statement aloud, saying, “the ongoing war in Afghanistan is illegal and has no root in Sharia [Islamic] law” and “it does nothing but shed the blood of Muslims.” 
“We the religious Ulema call on the Taliban to respond positively to the peace offer of the Afghan government in order to prevent further bloodshed in the country,” the statement said.

35878,2018-06-04,Confidential January letter from Trump lawyers to Mueller published by New York Times,"On Saturday, The New York Times published an article describing a January letter from President Donald Trump’s lawyers to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which responded to a list of questions from the special counsel’s Russia investigation by saying, “we have concluded that your office has already received the answers from the documents and testimony” provided by “the President, the White House, his staff, the Trump campaign and the Trump organization.” The confidential 20-page letter was dated Jan. 29 and authored by John Dowd and Jay Sekulow. 
With respect to the allegations that Trump may have obstructed justice in the Russia investigation, the letter says Trump “by virtue of his position as the chief law enforcement officer, could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself, and that he could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired.”
The reference to obstruction of justice may relate to former FBI Director James Comey’s account of comments Trump allegedly made in February 2017. One comment alleges former national security advisor Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn. Flynn, who resigned on Feb. 14, 2017, had “inadvertently” briefed Vice President Mike Pence and others with “incomplete information” regarding his “phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.” Trump allegedly told Comey the following day, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Media outlets have published articles about whether this, or a December 2017 tweet from Trump, constitutes obstruction of justice. 
The letter also says Trump’s lawyers are “guided by” the “Espy” case, “that those seeking information from the President must ‘demonstrate with specificity why it is likely that the subpoenaed materials [here, his testimony] contain important evidence and why this evidence, or equivalent evidence, is not practically available from another source.’” 
The Espy case refers to Circuit, In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997). During the case, an independent counsel prosecuting former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy for improperly accepting gifts subpoenaed the White House Counsel’s investigation into Espy, seeking the White House Counsel’s notes. Former President Bill Clinton withheld documents, claiming executive privilege. An appeals court ruled the prosecutor could subpoena the notes if they “likely” contain “important evidence” and “the evidence is not available with due diligence elsewhere.”
Dowd and Sekulow also wrote that “the President of the United States is not above the law, but just as obvious and equally as true is the fact that the President should not be subjected to strained readings and forced applications of clearly irrelevant statutes.” The letter concluded with an offer to “receive any further questions and provide you the answers to help you complete your report and resolve any other remaining questions you might have.”
On Saturday, Trump wrote on Twitter, “There was No Collusion with Russia” and questioned which party was “leaking” his letters to the media.
Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith said “the intersection between the obstruction statutes and the president exercising his constitutional power to supervise an investigation in the Justice Department” is “an open question,” according to the Times.

35862,2018-06-04,"Guatemalan volcanic eruption kills 62, injures 15","The Volcan de Fuego, or “Volcano of Fire,” in Guatemala erupted on Sunday, killing at least 62 people and at least 15 have been hospitalized. At least 46 others are missing, Guatemala’s national disaster agency said. 

The eruption began before noon, sending ash 3.7 miles (6 km) into the air. The ash fell on the nation’s capital, Guatemala City, and on the nearby area of Sacatepéquez Department, the town of Chimaltenango and city of Escuintla. Lava and pyroclastic flow began moving down the mountain at about 4 p.m. local time, entering villages and covering roads. 
The National Disaster Management Agency’s director, Sergio Cabañas, said the town of El Rodeo was “buried.” The director of the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, Fanuel Garcia, confirmed the updated death count of 62 on Monday evening. Rescue workers pulled at least 10 people alive from ash and mud flows on the volcano on Monday. Rescuers were still attempting to reach some of the affected villages as of Monday afternoon, BBC reported. 
Hundreds of police officers, firefighters, soldiers and emergency workers have been deployed to the affected areas. Approximately 3,100 people have been evacuated and 1.7 million people have been affected by the eruption, the Associated Press reported. 
Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales declared three days of national mourning and said he would declare a state of emergency, which would need to be approved by Congress. The international airport in Guatemala city has been closed due to ash.
Volcanic flow
Pyroclastic flow from volcanoes is a mixture of gas and hot volcanic material, such as pumice and ash, that can travel up to 435 mph (700 km/h) and reach temperatures between 392 and 1,292 degrees Fahrenheit, (200 and 700 degrees Celsius), according to BBC. Lava flow from Fuego reached 1,292 degrees Fahrenheit (700 degrees Celsius), according to Eddy Sanchez, the director of Guatemala’s seismology and volcanology institute. 
Volcan de Fuego
Fuego is about 25 miles (40 km) south and west of Guatemala City and at its peak has an altitude of 12,346 feet (3,763 meters). An eruption in February sent ash 1.1 miles (1.7 km) into the air, and one in 1974 caused damage to local farms. No deaths were reported in either case.

35837,2018-06-04,Police: Denver Uber driver said passenger was shot during attack attempt,"On Friday, Denver police said they arrested Uber driver Michael Andre Hancock, 29, in connection with the fatal shooting of his passenger, Hyun Kim, 45. A police statement said, “There is probable cause to believe that Michael Hancock discharged [a semi-automatic handgun], striking [Kim] numerous times causing his death.” At about 2:47 a.m. local time Friday, a male witness at the scene on an on-ramp to I-25 called 911 saying Hancock told him his passenger tried to attack him and he shot the rider.
Denver police issued a statement of probable cause describing the incident. The statement was partially redacted and did not show the victim’s name. It said the male witness who called 911 handed the phone to Hancock, who then identified himself to the dispatcher.
Police arrived at the scene and found Hancock’s sedan crashed into a concrete barrier, almost perpendicular to the direction of traffic. Police found Kim on the floorboard of the front passenger seat of the car, with apparent gunshot wounds, and began lifesaving procedures until paramedics arrived. Kim was pronounced dead at the hospital.
Police handcuffed Hancock and removed a Ruger semi-automatic handgun from his waistband. According to the police statement, Hancock began to have trouble breathing and was taken to DHMC hospital, where he was treated and then released.
Investigators found 10 spent .40-caliber shell casings on the left shoulder of the road, suspected bullet strikes in the passenger compartment of the car and blood on the pavement, according to the statement. I-25 southbound lanes were closed from about 3 a.m. until about 8 a.m. local time while police investigated.
Hancock declined to issue a statement about the incident without an attorney, the statement said.
Hancock does not have a criminal record in Colorado, according to court records. He has had traffic tickets. Uber, a ride-hailing company, said Hancock had been a driver with them for about three years.
Hancock’s parents said their son had a permit to carry a concealed handgun from when he worked as a security guard. Marika Putnam, a Denver police spokeswoman, said she did not know if the existence of such a permit had been confirmed. Colorado allows gun owners to carry firearms in their vehicles without a permit, according to The Washington Post.
Uber company policy says drivers and riders are not allowed to carry firearms while using its app, and if they are found doing so, they “may lose access to Uber.” Some states do not allow employers to prohibit firearm possession. Uber said its policy on firearms should apply in Colorado.
Following the incident, Uber issued a statement saying, ""We are deeply troubled by the events in Denver today. Our thoughts are with the families of those involved. The driver's access to the app has been removed, and we will continue working closely with police."" Uber also said the incident appeared to have occurred during an on-app trip.

35921,2018-06-05,Mueller investigation accuses Paul Manafort of attempted witness tampering,"Late on Monday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigative team accused former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort of attempting to tamper with witnesses in his upcoming trial for alleged fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. The charges resulted from Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian election interference and “related matters,” though involve incidents that predate Manafort’s involvement with the Trump campaign. Manafort pleaded not guilty to those crimes in March. His trial is scheduled to begin July 10
Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor on Mueller’s team, filed an 18-page motion with a Washington court on Monday that alleged Manafort and an associate identified as Person A attempted to contact witnesses to influence their testimony after Manafort’s indictment in February. The motion calls for an immediate hearing to determine if the men contacted two unnamed witnesses “in an effort to secure materially false testimony.” 
The witnesses reportedly worked for the so-called Hapsburg Group — a group of former European officials whom Mueller alleged that Manafort hired to lobby on behalf of then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s interests.
According to a sworn affidavit by Brock Domin, a FBI agent on the case, Manafort phoned and messaged one of the witnesses on Feb. 24, the day after his former business partner Rick Gates pleaded guilty to two charges, and continued calling and messaging him several days after. The affidavit said Manafort told the witness he wanted to give a “heads-up about Hapsburg,” then the witness hung up the phone. He tried to phone the witness again on Feb. 25 and Feb 27, according to the phone records cited in the motion.
The motion alleges Manafort sent the witness a series of messages on an encrypted platform on Feb. 26, including one that said “This is paul,” another with a link to a news article about Manafort allegedly paying Europeans for Ukrainian lobbying work and another that said, “We should talk. I have made clear that they worked in Europe.” 
The politicians in the so-called Hapsburg Group who reportedly lobbied for Yanukovych include former Austrian chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer and former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Politico reported. According to disclosure filings filed after the time, they visited Washington and met with members of Congress in 2013. Both have said Manafort did not pay them. 
Spokespeople for both Manafort and Mueller’s office declined to comment to The Washington Post on Monday night. 
In January, Manafort sued Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, alleging they “exceed the scope” of their authority in investigating any coordination between Manafort and Russia prior to his work on the Trump campaign.

35906,2018-06-05,Supreme Court overturns lower court’s ruling in case of baker who declined to make cake for same-sex wedding,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 on Monday in favor of a Colorado baker who had declined to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2012. The court’s majority opinion said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which first adjudicated the issue, had showed “impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs” of the baker Jack Phillips. The court’s ruling specified that larger constitutional questions of businesses declining to provide service to same-sex people on religious basis in other circumstances “must await further elaboration in the courts.” 
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that the state’s civil rights commission’s “hostility” towards Phillips’ religious beliefs “was inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.” One commissioner had said, for instance, that freedom of religion had been used to “justify” slavery and the Holocaust.
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that statements by Colorado commissioners who had ruled against Phillips did not change whether or not Phillips violated the state’s anti-discrimination laws. “What matters is that Phillips would not provide a good or service to a same-sex couple that he would provide to a heterosexual couple,” Ginsberg wrote in the dissenting opinion.
Background of the case
Colorado-based couple Charlie Craig and David Mullins got married in 2012 in Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage was legal at the time and while it was illegal in Colorado. The couple planned to hold a reception in Denver, and went to Phillips’ Masterpiece bakery to order a cake. 
In July 2012, the couple and Craig’s mother met with Phillips, and when Phillips learned the cake would be for a same-sex wedding reception he declined to make the cake. Phillips said he remembered telling the couple, “Sorry guys, I don’t make cakes for same-sex weddings.” He offered to sell other baked goods, such as birthday cakes. The couple left the establishment.
Craig and Mullins filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission after it learned the state’s public accommodations law prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Colorado Anti-discrimination Act (CADA) requires that businesses that are open to the public serve customers equally regardless of “disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, or ancestry.”
Phillips argued that requiring him to use his “artistic talents” to create a cake would violate his First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of religion. 
The commission ruled in the couple’s favor, then Phillips took the case to the Colorado Court of Appeals. The appeals court upheld the commission's ruling, concluding that the Colorado law did not require Philips to “support or endorse any particular religious view,” rather it prohibited him from discriminating against a potential customer on the basis of sexual orientation. Phillips appealed the case to the Supreme Court. 
The Justice Department under the Trump administration agreed with Phillips reasoning. In October of last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum outlining that the government may not discriminate against religious people or entities. 
The Supreme Court ruling
The Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated Phillips’ rights by demonstrating “hostility” towards his religious beliefs. 
“The Court’s precedents make clear that the baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, might have his right to the free exercise of religion limited by generally applicable laws,” Kennedy wrote. “Still, the delicate question of when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an otherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in an adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought to reach.”
“The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market,” Kennedy wrote.
Justice Clarence Thomas voted in favor of Phillips, but did not support the majority’s rationale for the ruling; so the ruling was 7-2, while the majority opinion was 6-2. Kennedy also wrote the majority opinion in the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage throughout the U.S.
Viewpoints on the ruling 
Phillips, who founded the bakery in 1993, previously said in an interview, “I didn't want to use my artistic talents to create something that went against my Christian faith,” and said he has declined to make Halloween cakes for the same reason, calling it a “pagan holiday.” He has also said his decision was “not about turning away these customers, it's about doing a cake for an event — a religious sacred event — that conflicts with my conscience.”
Phillips declined to comment after the ruling. His representation from the Alliance Defending Freedom, attorney Michael Farris, said his client was “ecstatic” over the ruling. 
“Tolerance and respect for good-faith differences of opinion are essential in a society like ours,” said Kristen Waggoner, another of Phillips’ attorney at the alliance. “This decision makes clear that the government must respect [Phillips’] beliefs about marriage.”
Mullins has said the case is about “the rights of gay people to receive equal service in business,” and is “about basic access to public life.” 
The decision “means our fight against discrimination and unfair treatment will continue,” Mullins said in a statement after Monday’s ruling. “We have always believed that in America, you should not be turned away from a business open to the public because of who you are.”
American Civil Liberties Union representative Louise Melling said, “the court reversed the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision based on concerns unique to the case but reaffirmed its longstanding rule that states can prevent the harms of discrimination in the marketplace, including against LGBT people.”
Twenty-one states have anti-discrimination laws the expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

35984,2018-06-06,Ethiopia accepts full 2000 peace agreement with neighbor Eritrea,"Ethiopia announced Tuesday it would fully accept the terms of a peace agreement signed in 2000 with neighboring Eritrea. Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia’s east coast, declared its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and a border war began between the countries in 1998. The 2000 peace agreement established a U.N.-supported boundary commission to draw a border in contested regions between the countries. Ethiopia did not initially accept the commission’s final 2002 border ruling, and the country said Tuesday it would. 
According to Al Jazeera, at least 80,000 people died in fighting between the two countries. 
Ethiopia’s governing party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, wrote on Facebook, “The Eritrean government should take the same stand without any prerequisite and accept our call to bring back the long-lost peace of the two brother nations as it was before.” 
In his inaugural address to parliament in April, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said, ""We are fully committed to reconcile with our Eritrean brothers and sisters and extend an invitation to the Eritrean government to start dialogue and establish rapport.” 
Al Jazeera reported that Eritrea's information ministry did not post anything about Ethiopia’s announcement, and Eritrean officials in Ethiopia’s capital could not be immediately reached for comment. Eritrea has been ruled since 1993 by President Isaias Afwerki.
Also on Tuesday, Ethiopia lifted a state of emergency that had been put in place in 2016 and reinstated in February of this year; it had been scheduled to expire in two months. The state of emergency had been put in place following months of protests by one of the country’s ethnic groups. Anti-government protests requesting more freedoms in the country have been ongoing for two years, Al Jazeera reported.
In addition, Ethiopia announced Tuesday it would allow private investment in parts of state-owned companies in areas such as energy, aviation and telecommunications.

35981,2018-06-06,"White House announces canceled Eagles visit, holds ‘celebrate America’ ceremony","President Donald Trump held a “celebrate America” event at the White House on Tuesday, after announcing on Monday that the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles football team’s visit had been canceled. Trump said that the Eagles were “unable to come to the White House with their full team” for the event scheduled for Tuesday, saying the players “disagree” with him over the issue of standing for the national anthem. 
Beginning in 2016 and continuing during the 2017 season, some NFL players did not stand during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first to sit, and then kneel during the anthem. He said he did not want to “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” 
No Eagles players knelt during the national anthem last season, The Washington Post reported. 
Last month, the National Football League (NFL) adopted a new policy under which teams could be fined if their players on the field did not stand for the national anthem. Under the rule, players could stay in the locker room during the anthem if they did not want to stand. 
In his Monday announcement, Trump said the Eagles “disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.” 
Prior to Trump’s announcement, some players had announced they would not attend a White House visit. Eagles player Malcolm Jenkins said in February of such a potential visit: “because it’s not a meeting or a sit-down or anything like that, I'm just not interested in the photo op.” Jenkins also said he’d met with legislators from both parties over the past two years and if politicians wanted “to meet to talk about events” in his community and “changing the country,” he’d be “all for that.” He added, “this isn't one of those meetings, so I'll opt out of the photo opportunity.""
The team that wins the Super Bowl is traditionally invited to the White House to celebrate. Eagles coach Doug Pederson said on May 22 that the team would visit the White House on June 5. As the visit date approached, five Eagles players had committed to visit the White House, according to ESPN journalist Don Van Natta. (There are 90 players on the team’s total roster.) Van Natta said a source told him the other Eagles players were planning on visiting a school and a community center in the Washington area on Tuesday. The team canceled the visit once Trump canceled the team’s visit to the White House.
Trump said, “The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony -- one that will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it.” 
The president tweeted on the day of the announcement, “The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!”
On Tuesday, Trump tweeted, “We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!” The ceremony happened as planned on Tuesday.
Response
After Trump’s statement canceling the visit, the Eagles released a statement: “It has been incredibly thrilling to celebrate our first Super Bowl Championship. Watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration. We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season.”
The NFL Players Association tweeted a statement on Tuesday morning: “Our union is disappointed in the decision by the White House to disinvite players from the Philadelphia Eagles from being recognized and celebrated by all Americans for their accomplishment. This decision by the White House has led to the cancellation of several player-led community service events for young people in the Washington, D.C. area. NFL players love their country, support our troops, give back to their communities and strive to make America a better place.” 
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Monday he was proud of the “Eagles' activism off the field. These are players who stand up for the causes they believe in and who contribute in meaningful ways to their community. They represent the diversity of our nation -- a nation in which we are free to express our opinions.""
In a Washington Post poll last fall, 53 percent of people said it was “never appropriate” to kneel during the national anthem.

35978,2018-06-06,Jordanian Prime Minister Mulki resigns after protests,"Jordanian King Abdullah II summoned Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki to the royal palace on Monday, where Mulki resigned after days of protests against government economic reforms. Abdullah appointed Omar al-Razzaz, the education minister and a former World Bank economist, as prime minister and asked him to form a new government. Mulki had been prime minister since June 2016.
Protests over the course of four consecutive nights resulted in dozens of arrests and more than 40 members of the security forces being injured. The Hirak Shababi (youth movement) group, along with 33 professional associations and civil society groups in Jordan organized the demonstrations, Al Jazeera reported. Demonstrators said after Mulki’s resignation that they would continue their protests.
This year, Jordan increased taxes on food items by 50 to 100 percent and eliminated bread subsidies, according to Al Jazeera and BBC. Demonstrators were protesting price increases as well as a proposed tax reform law that would increase the percentage of citizens who pay income taxes in Jordan from approximately 4.5 to about 10 percent, according to Al Jazeera. 
Proposed tax law
The proposed tax reform law would lower the threshold of taxable income for a family from $34,000 to $22,500 per year, and for an individual from $17,000 to $11,200. The law would also increase tax rates for banks from 35 to 40 percent. It would increase government revenue from an estimated $350 million to $430 million by 2020-21, according to Mousa al-Tarawneh, a spokesman for the government’s income and sales tax department. Jordan has a $700 million budget deficit.
Parliament is not in session, so Abdullah would have to call parliament to convene before it would debate the bill. At least 80 of 130 parliament members have signed a statement saying they would not support the bill, Al Jazeera reported. At least a majority of members present must vote in favor of a bill for it to pass parliament.
The tax bill is supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Jordan must reduce spending and raise revenue to receive loans from the IMF, according to NPR. 
Jordan had a population of 9.5 million in 2016 and the unemployment rate averaged 18.3 percent in 2017, according to The World Bank.

35975,2018-06-06,"Harvey Weinstein pleads not guilty to two counts of rape, one of a criminal sex act","On Tuesday, former movie producer Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty to three felony counts, first-degree rape, third-degree rape and a first-degree criminal sex act, during his arraignment at New York’s Supreme Court. Weinstein has been out on $1 million bail since he turned himself in to New York City police on May 25. Weinstein is scheduled to appear in court for a hearing on September 20, according to his attorney, Benjamin Brafman.
“As terrible a crime as rape is, it is equally reprehensible to be falsely accused of rape,” Brafman said. “And since Mr. Weinstein has denied these allegations, that’s where we are.”
The charges against Weinstein relate to allegations from two women in separate incidents: one in 2004 involving Lucia Evans, and another in 2013 involving a woman whose identity has been sealed as part of the criminal proceedings. The maximum possible total sentence for the charges is 37 years in prison, according to Fox News.
A grand jury indicted Weinstein, 66, on the charges last Wednesday. It is still hearing evidence and could add charges in the case, The New York Times reported.
The New York Times and The New Yorker published articles last October in which at least 13 women accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct or harassment. In total, more than 80 women have made public accusations against Weinstein, according to Fox News. Weinstein has said he “never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone,” according to Brafman.
Civil lawsuit
On Friday, three women filed a separate class-action lawsuit against Weinstein and some of his former employers. One of the plaintiffs, Melissa Thompson, alleges Weinstein raped her in a hotel room in 2011. Another, Caitlin Dulany, alleges that Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent in 1996. A third plaintiff, Larissa Gomes, alleges that Weinstein touched her breasts and forced her to kiss him in 2000. 
The class-action lawsuit also alleges that some of Weinstein’s employers may have concealed his conduct or were part of a “decadeslong campaign to squelch complaints or illegally procure the silence of victims, witnesses and others.”
The New York Police Department said the three womens’ allegations were beyond the statute of limitations; they are not part of the criminal proceedings to which Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Tuesday.

April goods and services exports were $211.2 billion, $600 million more than in March, and imports were $257.4 billion, $400 million less than in March.
The U.S. has a trade deficit in goods and a trade surplus in services, which combines to an overall goods and services deficit. The April goods and services deficit was the lowest it has been in seven months. 
For January through April 2018, the goods and services trade deficit increased by $20.8 billion, or 11.5 percent, compared to the same four-month period the year before. 
From March to April of this year, the goods deficit decreased by $1.0 billion to $68.3 billion, and the services surplus decreased by less than $100 million to $22.1 billion.
Exports of goods increased by $300 million to $141.2 billion in April, with fuel oil exports increasing by $500 million and soybeans and corn by $300 million each. Exports of services increased by $300 million to $70.0 billion in April.

	Mexico: $6.0 billion deficit
	Canada: $1.7 billion deficit
	South and Central America: $4.1 billion surplus
	Hong Kong: $2.2 billion surplus
	U.K.: $0.9 billion surplus

Recent trade tariffs
The administration of President Donald Trump has implemented a number of trade tariffs this year. For a timeline of some of these actions, see our context here. The U.S. implemented 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports from some countries on March 23. After the U.S. let exemptions from those tariffs for Canada, Mexico and the EU expire on June 1, those regions have said they would implement tariffs on imports from the U.S.
On Tuesday, Mexico imposed tariffs ranging from 10 to 25 percent on about $3 billion of U.S. imports, including on pork, apples, potatoes, bourbon, steel and cheese. Mexico announced the tariffs last week as a response to the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, total goods exported to Mexico in 2017 were $243.0 billion and total goods imported were $314.0 billion; the trade deficit in goods was $71.1 billion that year. 
Also in response to the U.S.’ steel and aluminum tariffs, Canada announced it would impose tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. imports in July. The EU also said it would impose tariffs on about $2.8 billion worth of U.S. imports in July.

36130,2018-06-07,Paul Ryan says Rep. Gowdy’s assessment on FBI informant in Trump campaign is ‘accurate’,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said on Wednesday he had “seen no evidence to the contrary” of Rep. Trey Gowdy’s (R-S.C.) “initial assessment” about an investigation of an FBI informant interacting with President Donald Trump’s campaign to gather information regarding possible Russian contacts. Gowdy had said the FBI behaved appropriately when investigating information about alleged connections between campaign advisers and Russia, and that it had “nothing to do with Donald Trump.”
Ryan and Gowdy, who is House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman, were briefed last month by the Department of Justice on the matter. Last week, Gowdy said in an interview, “I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got.” 
“I think when the president finds out what happened, he is going to be not just fine, he is going to be glad that we have an FBI that took seriously what they heard,” added Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor. 
Ryan told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday that “Chairman Gowdy’s initial assessment is accurate, but we have more digging to do.”
Background
Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and “related matters,” such as the possibility of coordination between members of Trump’s campaign and Russians. Prior to Mueller’s appointment as special counsel last May, the FBI was investigating alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians, including Russians who allegedly had information on hacked Democratic National Committee emails. 
The FBI used an informant to gather information about this from members of Trump’s campaign. The informant was an American academic who had worked in Republican administrations, according to The New York Times. 
Last month, Trump tweeted about the investigation into his campaign members on multiple occasions, calling it “spygate.” He said it involved “spies” in his campaign, put there by Democrats for the “sole purpose of political advantage” to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. 
On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that spying began in 2015, before the FBI began its investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He did not provide evidence for his allegations of spying. 
Last month, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) requested a briefing from FBI and Justice Department officials on the matter of the FBI informant. Leaders from the Republican and Democratic parties in the House and Senate and the intelligence committees, including Ryan and Gowdy, attended two briefings from Justice Department and FBI officials. 
“Normally I don’t like to comment on classified briefings,” Ryan said Wednesday. “Let me say it this way: I think Chairman Gowdy’s initial assessment is accurate. I think — but we have some more digging to do. We’re waiting for some more document requests. We have some more documents to review. We still have some unanswered questions.” Ryan added that he wanted to “make sure that we run every lead down and make sure we get final answers to these questions.”
Nunes said the Justice Department should “just provide us all the documents, everything we’re asking for and let us comb all the way through it and we’ll issue a letter on Friday and we’ll be done with this.”
Ryan on the possibility of Trump pardoning self
Regarding a statement Trump made saying that as president he could pardon himself, Ryan, who is not a lawyer, said, “I don’t know the technical answer to that question. But I think obviously the answer is, he shouldn’t and no one is above the law.” 
Trump tweeted on Monday that he had the “absolute right” to pardon himself, adding that he had “done nothing wrong” in regard to the Mueller investigation.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that the issue was an “academic discussion,” and Trump “obviously knows” that a self-pardon “would not be something that he would or should do.”

36127,2018-06-07,Iraqi parliament orders manual recount for May 12 election,"On Wednesday, the outgoing Iraqi parliament voted to order a manual recount of the 11 million votes cast in the May 12 national election. Parliament also replaced leaders of the election commission and annulled votes of Iraqis who were overseas or displaced. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had said on Tuesday that security agencies had evidence of “unprecedented” voting violations, including issues with electronic vote-counting machines that had not been used before the May 12 election. 
Intelligence services tested the voting machines and the machines produced what Al Jazeera reported to be “varied results.”
A committee of Iraqi security and anti-corruption leaders submitted a report on the election and the role of the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) to al-Abadi. The prime minister said Tuesday that at first he planned to “let the commission deal with the violations,” as “there are violations each election, here and there.” He changed his mind after the report, saying the security and anti-corruption committee had “revealed dangerous things.” 
“There may have been some violations by candidates but the election commission bears the largest share of the responsibility,” al-Abadi said. Officials in the IHEC had not taken the “needed measures” or had taken “wrong ones,” including not checking the vote-counting machines for errors, the prime minister said.  
Al-Abadi prohibited some IHEC officials from leaving the country without permission, and said criminal charges may be brought against some of the officials.
The IHEC previously denied there were abnormal violations in this election. It did not immediately respond to Wednesday’s decision. 
The official May 12 election results showed that a coalition between Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and other parties had won 54 of the 328 seats in parliament. Another coalition won 47 seats, and al-Abadi’s coalition came in third with 42 seats. A majority coalition of at least 165 seats is needed to form a new government with a new prime minister. 
Al-Abadi will stay in office until a new prime minister is chosen. Al-Sadr, the leader of the coalition with the most seats prior to the recount, would not be eligible to be the next prime minister under the new government because he did not run in the May 12 elections, according to Al Jazeera.
The May election was the first since the Iraqi government declared victory over Islamic State last December. The voter turnout was 44.5 percent.

36357,2018-06-08,Paul Manafort and colleague Konstantin Kilimnik charged with obstructing justice,"Paul Manafort and a Russian colleague of his, Konstantin Kilimnik, were indicted on charges of obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice on Friday. Earlier this week, federal prosecutors alleged in a court motion that Manafort and a “Person A,” now identified as Kilimnik, attempted to contact witnesses to influence their testimony after Manafort’s indictment in February. 
Manafort was indicted on 32 federal charges in February, including filing false tax returns, failure to report on foreign accounts and bank fraud. The indictment followed 12 charges from last October. Manafort pleaded not guilty to the charges in both cases. The charges resulted from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and “related matters,” although the charges are unrelated to Manafort’s involvement with the Trump campaign.
Kilimnik began working as a translator for Manafort in 2005 in his Kiev office, The Washington Post reported. Friday’s indictment said Kilimnik “oversaw” the Kiev office of Manafort’s Ukrainian political consulting business. Kilimnik said he and Manafort communicated while Manafort worked on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. He also said he visited the U.S. during May and August 2016. Kilimnik is currently believed to be in Moscow, according to The Washington Post.
News charges
The new obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice charges allege that “from in or about and between February 23, 2018, and April 2018” Manafort and Kilimnik “knowingly and intentionally attempted to corruptly persuade” witnesses “with intent to influence, delay, and prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding,” and knowingly conspired to do so. 
According to the 18-page motion to the court filed on Monday, Manafort phoned and messaged one of the witnesses on Feb. 24, the day after his former business partner Rick Gates pleaded guilty to two charges, and continued calling and messaging the witness for several days after. A sworn affidavit by Brock Domin, an FBI agent on the case said Manafort told the witness he wanted to give a “heads-up about Hapsburg,” then the witness hung up the phone. He tried to phone the witness again on Feb. 25 and Feb. 27, according to phone records cited in the motion. 
The so-called Hapsburg group is a group of former European officials whom Manafort allegedly hired to lobby on behalf of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s interests, according to Mueller’s team. Friday’s indictment alleges members of the group, as well as Manafort, acted as unregistered agents of a foreign government (Ukraine’s) by not registering with the U.S. attorney general’s office to conduct lobbying work. 
The motion alleged Manafort also sent the witness a series of messages on an encrypted platform on Feb. 26, including one that said, “This is paul,” another with a link to a news article about Manafort allegedly paying Europeans for Ukrainian lobbying work, and another that said, “We should talk. I have made clear that they worked in Europe.”
Judge Amy Berman Jackson scheduled a hearing for June 15 to address the alleged witness tampering.

36247,2018-06-08,"At least 18 killed, 38 wounded in Iraqi mosque explosion; government orders investigation","On Wednesday night, an explosion at a Baghdad mosque killed at least 18 people and wounded at least 38. The explosion destroyed the mosque, and destroyed or damaged 20 homes, according to CBS News.The Iraqi government said the explosion in the Sadr City district of Baghdad resulted from the detonation of an ammunition cache near or inside the Shiite mosque. On Thursday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered an investigation into the explosion. No person or group immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion.
AFP reported a police source saying the cache belonged to an armed group, and contained rocket-propelled grenades and shells. 
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said storing weapons in a residential area by ""unauthorized parties"" was a ""crime that led to the killing of innocent people."" Al-Abadi asked the Interior Ministry to take ""legal deterrent measures"" against those who committed this crime. He ordered security forces to search for and confiscate weapons from parties ""outside the official security forces.”
Shiite cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, whose coalition won the highest number of seats in parliament after elections last month, said his followers should exercise “patience and self-control” regarding the incident, and that an investigative committee would report to him on the explosion within three days.

36244,2018-06-08,Afghanistan announces ceasefire with Taliban until June 20,"On Wednesday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a ceasefire by government forces with the Taliban until June 20. The date coincides with the end of the Ramadan fasting month, the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Ghani said government military operations against other groups such as the Islamic State (IS) would continue during the ceasefire. The Taliban did not immediately respond to the government’s announcement. U.S. forces in the country said they would honor the ceasefire. CNN reported the ceasefire would begin the middle of next week.
Ghani said government forces ""will only stop offensive maneuvers against Afghan armed Taliban and will continue to target [IS] and other foreign-backed terrorist organizations and their affiliates."" He added, ""This ceasefire is an opportunity for Taliban to introspect that their violent campaign is not winning them hearts and minds, but further alienating the Afghan people from their cause.”
In February, Ghani called for peace talks with the Taliban “without preconditions,” and said he was willing to recognize the Taliban as a political group if it recognized the Afghan government and respected Afghan laws. 
This week a council of religious clerics convened and issued a statement saying it called on the Taliban “to respond positively to the peace offer of the Afghan government in order to prevent further bloodshed in the country.”
U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001, following the 9/11 attacks. Other countries have decreased their troop levels in Afghanistan from about 140,000 in 2014 to about 15,600, Reuters reported. Last year, more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in conflicts between government forces and the Taliban. 
In January, BBC reported the Taliban is “openly active” in 70 percent of Afghanistan. U.S. military information indicated that in October 2017, 14 percent of Afghan districts were under the control or influence of the Taliban or other militant groups, according to CNN.

36216,2018-06-08,US evacuates ‘several’ staffers from China consulate with symptoms ‘similar’ to a concussion,"On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said it had evacuated “several” staffers from its consulate in Guangzhou, China, and sent them to the U.S. for “further evaluation and a comprehensive assessment of their symptoms and findings.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set up a task force last month to investigate reports of damage to staffers’ hearing, memory and vision. Neither China nor the U.S. have said they have determined a cause for the symptoms.
On Tuesday, Pompeo announced he had set up the task force on May 23. He said in a statement, “At this time, 24 U.S. government personnel and family members who served in Cuba have been medically-confirmed as having symptoms and clinical findings similar to those [that are] noted following [a] concussion or minor traumatic brain injury.” He added that on May 16, a consulate staffer in China “was medically-confirmed with similar findings. The precise nature of the injuries suffered by the affected personnel, and whether a common cause exists for all cases, has not yet been established.”
Pompeo said, “Reported symptoms have included dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, fatigue, cognitive issues, visual problems, ear complaints and hearing loss, and difficulty sleeping.”
On May 23, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in China issued a health alert saying, “A U.S. government employee in China recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure. “ At the time it said it did not know what caused the symptoms and was “not aware of any similar situations in China, either inside or outside of the diplomatic community.”
On Thursday, China said it had investigated and could not determine a cause for the described symptoms, according to NPR. The Chinese foreign ministry said it would conduct further investigations if requested by the U.S., and that it took its obligation to protect foreign diplomats seriously.
State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said medical screenings of employees continue. Evacuated staff members have been tested at the University of Pennsylvania, where staff from Cuba had also been tested, according to The Associated Press.
Last September, the U.S. reduced its embassy personnel in Cuba by more than half to “minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,” then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. The U.S. later expelled 15 Cuban diplomats. Possible causes for the symptoms experienced by U.S. employees in Cuba were a sonic device, toxins or a virus, The New York Times reported. Cuba denied involvement in the reported medical issues. 
The U.S. has an embassy in Beijing and four consulates in China, in addition to the one in Guangzhou. Nauert said there are about 170 diplomats, employees and their families associated with the Guangzhou consulate.

36219,2018-06-08,"G7 Summit in Canada starts Friday, to include trade, climate change discussions","The G7 nations are scheduled to meet Friday and Saturday in Charlevoix, Quebec, to discuss trade and climate change, among other topics. The G7 is composed of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. The EU also attends the summit. After the meeting, President Donald Trump is scheduled to leave Canada on Saturday for Singapore, in preparation for his planned June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, “We believe in the G7, it’s an important group.” At the summit, Trump is scheduled to have one-on-one meetings with some leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron.
On Thursday, Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Washington to discuss North Korea and trade. That morning, Trump tweeted he was “getting ready to go to the G7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade.” 
The Trump administration this year implemented tariffs on multiple imports, including steel and aluminum, citing national security concerns. Larry Kudlow, economic advisor to the president, said, ""Until we can have reciprocal relationships, we will not have free trade, and we will not have fair trade.”
Trudeau said of the upcoming summit, ""We know certainly that there will be frank and sometimes difficult discussions around the G7 table, particularly with the U.S. president on tariffs.” Trudeau also planned to discuss gender equality and climate change at the meeting, according to Global News.
After meeting with Trudeau on Thursday, Macron said, ""The G7 is an opportunity for us to get together and have frank, open discussions among nations who have long been allies and friends.” He added that ""there will be subjects on which [Trump] is not totally in sync with the others -- I'm thinking of course of climate change and trade.”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German Parliament on Wednesday that “it is apparent that we have a serious problem with multilateral agreements here, and so there will be contentious discussions” at the G7 meeting.
Referencing a possible joint statement to be released at the end of the meeting, Macron said, ""Our common goal is to try to find a text that can be signed by everyone.” He added that ""the desire to sign a common G7 declaration must not outweigh the need to be mindful of the content."" Merkel said there would be ""no compromise for its own sake.”
G7 finance ministers met last week for three days. The six non-U.S. ministers ended the meeting with a message of “concern and disappointment” with U.S. tariffs.
The G7 was founded 42 years ago and its leaders meet yearly. The group’s presidency rotates annually. Canada currently holds the presidency and in February published its G7 priorities for 2018, which include: 

	“investing in growth that works for everyone”;
	“preparing for jobs of the future”;
	“advancing gender equality and women's empowerment”;
	“working together on climate change, oceans and clean energy”; and
	“building a more peaceful and secure world.” 

This will be Trump’s second G7 summit. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will be attending his first G7 meeting after being sworn in last Friday.
Trump’s policies on some international agreements
Since taking office, Trump announced last June that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, saying the U.S. would “begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States.” In May, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of sanctions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later listed 12 U.S. requirements for a potential new agreement with Iran. 
Last January, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that included Canada and Japan. In April, he asked his trade advisers to examine the possibility of re-entering negotiations for a trans-Pacific trade agreement if the U.S. arranged favorable terms. 
This year, Trump implemented tariffs on solar cells, washing machines, and steel and aluminum. The administration said the steel and aluminum tariffs were related to national security concerns. The U.S. also let an exemption to steel and aluminum tariffs expire on June 1 for Canada, Mexico and the EU, which said they would implement response tariffs on U.S. imports. Mexico did so this week. Japan is also subject to the metal tariffs by the U.S.
In May, the Trump administration announced an investigation into whether automobile imports present national security concerns.
The U.S. has been in negotiations since last August with Canada and Mexico over the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

36373,2018-06-09,"1 US service member killed, 3 injured in Somalia attack","On Friday, one U.S. service member was killed and four others injured in a mortar and small arms attack in Somalia, according to U.S. Africa Command. A Kenyan soldier working with the Somali and U.S. soldiers was also injured, according to U.S. military officials. The attackers have not been identified. 
The U.S. Africa Command said there were 800 U.S., Somali and Kenyan troops present where the attack took place in Jubaland, about 218 miles (350 km) southwest of the country’s capital city of Mogadishu. The troops were reportedly in the area to set up a permanent combat outpost. 
The U.S. troops were aiding the Somali government in combating the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab group for control of the Jubaland region. During Friday’s attack, U.S. forces were providing “advice, assistance and aerial surveillance,” Africa Command said, while the local forces conducted an operation to take villages from al-Shabab’s control.

36370,2018-06-09,ICC overturns war crimes conviction of Congo’s Bemba,"On Friday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) overturned the 2016 conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba, the former vice president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In a 3-2 decision on the five-judge panel, the court ruled that Bemba could not be held responsible for crimes, including rapes and murders, carried out by a militia under his command while they were in the neighboring Central African Republic (CAR). 
“Bemba cannot be held criminally responsible for the crimes committed by [Movement for the Liberation of Congo] troops during the Central African Republic operation,” the presiding judge Christine Van den Wyngaert read from the ruling. 
Van den Wyngaert also said the initial trial judges had “ignored significant testimonial evidence that Bemba's ability to investigate and punish crimes in CAR was limited,” and failed to account for his attempts to stop the crimes once he learned of them.
The case
Bemba commanded the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) militia, which he helped form as a rebel group in 1998. In 2002, at the request of then-CAR President Ange Felix Patasse, Bemba sent about 1,000 MLC troops to the neighboring country to stop an attempted coup. While in CAR, MLC troops engaged in an alleged campaign of rape, sexual violence and murder of civilians between 2002 and 2003. 
Although Bemba had not ordered this campaign, prosecutors argued he was aware of it and did not stop it. 
Bemba was arrested by the ICC in 2008 and his trial began in 2010. After a trial of over five years with more than 5,000 witnesses, the ICC panel of judges unanimously found him guilty of two counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of war crimes. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. His sentence was later increased by a year and he was fined for attempting to interfere with witnesses’ testimony. 
Bemba will not be immediately released from detention at The Hague, as a separate panel of judges will determine what sentence he should be given for witness interference, Van den Wyngaert said. The court is scheduled to meet Tuesday on the matter. 
Responses to the ruling
“It’s not some acquittal on a technicality,” Bemba’s attorney Peter Haynes said. “They went to the very heart of a commander’s culpability, namely his responsibility to ensure that when put in the knowledge of crimes he takes steps to investigate them and punish them.” He added that it was “immoral and it may even be illegal” to not immediately release Bemba from custody. 
ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said Friday’s decision was “regrettable and troubling.”
The two dissenting judges wrote in an opinion that Bemba’s acquittal was based on “an incorrect standard of appellate review.”
The head of Amnesty International’s international justice team, Solomon Sacco, called the decision a “blow” for CAR victims. 
“5,229 survivors of Bemba’s atrocities participated in the ICC proceedings — for these brave individuals, as well as thousands of other victims in CAR, the pursuit of truth, justice and reparations will continue,” Sacco said.
Karine Bonneau of the International Federation for Human Rights said the ruling seemed to tell other leaders that “as long as you are not on the scene,” you will not be “condemned” for the crimes of your troops.  
The ICC
The ICC permanent war crimes court was established in 2002 at The Hague in the Netherlands, under the Rome Statute treaty of 1998 signed by 120 countries at a U.N. conference. The court is an independent judicial body designed to prosecute people for “genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression.” The ICC can investigate and prosecute these crimes in a country when local authorities do not.
The ICC has issued 32 arrest warrants in 26 cases, some of which were dropped after suspects died. Judges have issued verdicts in nine cases; prior to Friday’s decision, nine people have been convicted and one acquitted. 
Two African countries, Burundi and The Gambia, have withdrawn from the ICC, alleging the court is biased against African nations and has not prosecuted people in other parts of the world. South Africa had formally written to the U.N. to indicate its intention to withdraw, then later revoked its decision. The Philippines has also said it would withdraw from the ICC, alleging the court did not follow due process after it opened an investigation into thousands of Filipino deaths since Rodrigo Duterte became president two years ago.

36489,2018-06-11,CBP: Honduran immigrant detained for illegal border crossing committed suicide in May,"On Saturday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed Honduran immigrant Marco Antonio Muñoz died last month while in custody at Starr County Jail. Muñoz had been apprehended on May 11 for “attempting illegal entry into the U.S.,” according to a CBP spokesperson. The cause of death was listed as “suicide by self-strangulation and hanging” on May 13, according to a report by the Texas attorney general. 
On May 11, Muñoz, 39, his wife and 3-year old son were apprehended by the Weslaco, Texas, Border Patrol station after “attempting illegal entry” from Mexico into the U.S. They were taken to the Rio Grande Valley Central Processing Center and, while there, Muñoz “became disruptive and combative,” according to the CBP spokesperson. The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post both cited an anonymous border agent who said Muñoz became upset after he was told the family would be separated. 
When immigrants enter the U.S. illegally, the current Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy may result in children being separated from adults they are traveling with, as reported previously. Specifically, on April 7, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero-tolerance policy” for immigrants illegally entering the U.S. On May 7, Sessions announced the DHS would refer “100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution.” He also said, “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.” 
Children are prohibited from being put in criminal jails, The Washington Post reported; adults who are prosecuted may be separated from children who are accompanying them.
Muñoz was transferred to the Starr County Jail on May 12. The attorney general’s report said he was “combative and noncompliant” at the jail. Muñoz was placed in a padded jail cell at about 10:47 p.m., according to the Starr County Jail’s incident report. Officers at the jail checked on Muñoz every 30 minutes during the night shift and there was a camera in his cell. During the morning shift, beginning at 8:00 a.m., detention officers checked on Muñoz, and the next time the officers checked, they found him unresponsive in his cell, according to the incident report. He was declared dead around 10 a.m., according to the attorney general’s report. 
The Post cited a border agent who said Muñoz’s wife and son have been released from custody.
CBP is conducting an internal review and the Texas Rangers are leading the investigation into Muñoz’s death.

36485,2018-06-11,"G7 leaders issue joint communique; Trump, Trudeau comment on it","On Saturday, G7 leaders issued a joint communique after meeting for two days in Charlevoix, Quebec. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the meeting had resulted in a “consensus document” that was “supported” by the seven member nations. After leaving the summit early and traveling for his planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Donald Trump tweeted he had instructed U.S. representatives not to endorse the communique based on what he called Trudeau’s “false statements” regarding trade.
The joint communique covered economic growth, jobs, gender equality, security and the environment. One topic of discussion at the summit under the subject of economic growth was trade. On June 1, the U.S. implemented import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum on Canada, Mexico and the EU. Mexico has implemented response tariffs, and the EU has announced plans for them. Canada announced response tariffs on $12.8 billion of American goods, which it said was equivalent to the value of steel and aluminum from Canada that would be subject to U.S. tariffs. 
Speaking Saturday before boarding Air Force One to Singapore, Trump said about other countries’ trade “barriers” on U.S. goods that “It’s going to stop, or we’ll stop trading with them. And that’s a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.” He added, “We’re like the piggy bank that everybody’s robbing. And that ends.” Trump also said, “If they retaliate [with tariffs], they’re making a mistake.”
On Saturday, Trudeau said steel and aluminium tariffs implemented by the U.S. on Canada on the basis of national security were “kind of insulting” to Canadians, who have fought “shoulder-to-shoulder” with Americans since World War I. Trump has said that tariffs such as the ones the U.S. is considering on automobiles could be justified on the basis of national security concerns: “It’s economic. It’s the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet.”
Trudeau said that during the summit, he told Trump, ""it would be with regret but it would be with absolute clarity and firmness that [Canadians] move forward with retaliatory measures on July 1, applying equivalent tariffs to the ones that the Americans have unjustly applied to us."" He also said, ""Canadians are polite and reasonable but we will also not be pushed around.”
Trump tweeted on Saturday evening, “Based on Justin’s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!”
Trump also tweeted, “PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’ Very dishonest  and
	the EU and countries other than the U.S. and Japan endorsing the “G7 Ocean and Plastics Charter.”

About the G7
The G7 is composed of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. The EU also attended the summit. The G7 was previously the G8, which included Russia until 2014, when the other countries suspended Russia’s membership after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. 
On Saturday morning, Trump said, “I would rather see Russia in the G8 as opposed to the G7. I would say that the G8 is a more meaningful group than the G7. Absolutely.” At his post-meeting news conference Saturday, Trudeau said having Russia return to the G7 was “not something we are even remotely interested in looking at at this time.”
Next year, the G7 presidency passes from Canada to France.

36655,2018-06-12,"Taliban kills district governor, 8 others in northern Afghanistan","Taliban forces killed a district governor and eight other people in an attack in northern Afghanistan on Monday night, according to government officials and the Taliban. The attack killed the governor of Kohistan district in Faryab, according to the provincial governor’s spokesman, Javed Bedar, who said the Taliban had taken control of the district.

Officials also reported fighting between Taliban and government forces in the northern province of Sari Pul. Authorities did not provide the number of casualties, Al Jazeera reported. 
Earlier on Monday, a suicide bombing at a government building in the capital city of Kabul killed 13 people and injured 31 others. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for that attack, on the IS-affiliated Amaq website. 
Also on Monday night, a gunman and a suicide bomber driving a Humvee attacked a government building in the Afghan city of Ghazni, killing five police officers and wounding 26 other people, including the district governor, according to provincial governor spokesman Arif Noori. He alleged the Taliban was responsible for the attack. No group immediately claimed responsibility for it.
Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said a government-declared ceasefire with the Taliban began Tuesday, under which it said it would not make offensive attacks against the Taliban. It’s scheduled to last until June 20. On June 8, two days after the government declared its ceasefire, the Taliban announced a ceasefire on government forces to start later this week, coinciding with the first three days of Eid, the holiday that ends Ramadan.
“The ceasefire went [into] effect this morning” Danish said. “We have ordered our forces to defend with all their power if they are attacked.”
The Afghan government and the Taliban have continued to fight each other since the U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks. Last year, more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in conflicts between government forces and the Taliban.

36633,2018-06-12,Trump and Kim meet in Singapore,"President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore for nearly five hours on Tuesday. After the meeting, the two leaders released a statement saying Trump “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea, and Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
Trump and Kim first met one-on-one with translators for about 38 minutes. Then talks continued with other advisers present, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, before the leaders released the joint statement. 
The statement included four points:
1. The U.S. and North Korea “commit to establish” new U.S.-North Korea “relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.”
2. The U.S. and North Korea “will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.”
3. “Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration,” North Korea “commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
4. The U.S. and North Korea “commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.”
The statement also said the U.S. and North Korea commit to hold follow-up negotiations, led by Pompeo, and “a relevant high-level” North Korean official, “at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes” of the U.S.-North Korea summit.
Trump’s and Kim’s face-to-face meeting was the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.
Topics of discussion
During a post-meeting press conference, Trump said he expected denuclearization to begin “very, very quickly,” adding that the process would be verified and would involve “having a lot of people in North Korea.” According to Trump, Kim told him North Korea was destroying a missile engine test site. He said Kim was “committed” to cease ballistic missile tests. 
Trump specified that sanctions will remain on North Korea while negotiations continue between the countries. He said U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises would not be restarted “unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should.” 
Trump said he wanted to get U.S. soldiers out of South Korea. “I want to bring our soldiers back home,” he said. “But that's not part of the equation right now. At some point I hope it will be.” The U.S. has 32,000 soldiers in South Korea, according to Trump. 
In a later interview with ABC News, Trump said the U.S. would stop its military “war games” exercises in South Korea, which he called “provocative” and “expensive.” 
U.S. military command in South Korea said Tuesday it had “received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises.” After the meeting, Trump called South Korean President Moon Jae-in to brief him on the meeting. A spokesman for Moon said South Korea needed more information “to understand” Trump’s intentions regarding joint military exercises.
Trump noted that during their meeting, he and Kim did not discuss removing American troops or nuclear weapons from South Korea.
The president also said human rights were discussed during the meeting. There are an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in North Korea, according to The Associated Press.
Trump said at the press conference he would “love to have” Kim at the White House, and that he thought Kim would “love to be there” at some future time. “I think he trusts me and I trust him,” Trump said about Kim. The president said he would be willing to visit North Korea “at the appropriate time.”
During the ABC News interview, Trump said Kim told him that his father, Kim Jong Il, had withdrawn from previous agreements because he was “let down” by the U.S. Kim Jong Un took power after his father died in 2011. 
Kim said at the joint press conference he and Trump “decided to leave the past behind. The world will see a major change.” Kim called the meeting a “good prelude to peace.” 
Kim said before the meeting that it was “not easy to get here,” adding, “old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles” to working together. “But we overcame all of them, and we are here today.”

36593,2018-06-12,Spain offers to receive 629 rescued migrants on board Aquarius,"On Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez offered to receive 629 migrants at Spain’s port of Valencia, after Italy and Malta declined to let the ship dock. The ship, named the Aquarius, rescued the migrants from the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Libya, on Saturday. About one quarter of the migrants come from Sudan, according to the rescue group SOS Méditerranée. 
“It’s our duty to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a secure port for these people,” Sánchez said.
Italian naval ships, cargo vessels and the Aquarius rescued the migrants on Saturday from inflatable boats. All of the migrants were transferred to the Aquarius, which traveled north towards Italy. The Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said the Mediterranean island country of Malta should accept the vessel. On Monday, Salvini wrote on Facebook, “Saving lives at sea is a duty, but transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp is not.” 
Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat declined to accept the Aquarius, saying Malta was not involved with the rescue operation and Italy was “creating a dangerous situation” by refusing to receive the migrants. On Monday, Malta sent a supply boat with food and water to be delivered to the Aquarius, according to AP. 
The Aquarius is more than 870 miles (750 nautical miles or 1,400 km) from Valencia. To sail there requires “at least two more days of sailing,” according to SOS Méditerranée Maritime Operations Manager Antoine Laurent. Doctors Without Borders said the migrants are “stable,” adding that some of the passengers had seawater in their lungs and chemical burns from gasoline mixing with water.

36590,2018-06-12,"Treasury Department sanctions Russian entities, individuals","The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Monday it would sanction five Russian entities and three Russian individuals. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said these entities “jeopardize the safety and security” of the U.S. because they have “directly contributed to improving Russia’s cyber and underwater capabilities through their work” with Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).
 
 The OFAC press release said Russia’s activities include the 2017 NotPetya cyber malware attack, cyber intrusions against the U.S. energy grid, and tracking undersea communications cables that carry the majority of the world’s telecommunications data.
The NotPetya cyber-attack, in June 2017, was a “mock” ransomware virus that damaged hard drive files. It affected computer systems of banks, energy firms, government officials, hospitals and an airport in Kiev, Ukraine. According to cybersecurity firm Cybereason, it cost an estimated $1.2 billion worldwide in lost revenue to companies; other estimates are higher. Russia has denied responsibility for NotPetya.
The sanctioned Russian entities and individuals were designated under Executive Order 13694, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities.” 
The entities and individuals are:

	Digital Security, which the U.S. says provided material and technological support to the FSB.
	ERPScan, a subsidiary of Digital Security.
	Embedi, owned or controlled by Digital Security.
	Kvant Scientific Research Institute, owned or controlled by FSB.
	Divetechnoservices, which obtained underwater equipment and diving systems for the FSB, according to the U.S.
	Aleksandr Lvovich Tribun, General Director of Divetechnoservices.
	Oleg Sergeyevich Chirikov, Program Manager of Divetechnoservices.
	Vladimir Yakovlevich Kaganskiy, Owner of Divetechnoservices.

The sanctions freeze any property or assets owned by the entities or individuals that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and “generally prohibit” U.S. persons from “engaging in transactions” with them. 
In March, the department sanctioned five entities and 19 individuals for alleged “malign Russian cyber activity,” including NotPetya. In April, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 17 Russian government officials, 12 companies and a state-owned weapons trading company and its subsidiary bank.

36585,2018-06-12,Supreme Court rules Ohio’s voter removal process does not violate federal law,"On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Ohio’s voter removal process does not violate federal voter laws, overturning a lower court’s judgment. Under Ohio’s policy, people who do not vote for two years are mailed a pre-addressed, postage prepaid card asking them to verify that they still reside at the same address. If a person fails to respond or vote within four years, his or her name is removed from voter registration rolls. 
 
 Ohio’s state voting laws require eligible residents to register 30 days in advance of an election in order to vote.
The plaintiffs argued that the Ohio policy violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), which makes it illegal to remove anyone from a voting list for failure to vote. Justice Samuel Alito, writing the majority opinion, concluded it did not violate the NVRA because Ohio’s process “does not strike any registrant solely by reason of the failure to vote.” 
Alito also cited 2012 Pew Center statistics that found 24 million voter registrations are estimated to be “either invalid or significantly inaccurate,” and that 2.75 million people are registered to vote in multiple states. 
Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Anthony Kennedy, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas voted with Alito for the majority. 
Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented. In the minority opinion, Breyer wrote that “using a registrant’s failure to vote is not a reasonable method for identifying voters whose registrations are likely invalid.” He wrote that in 2012, Ohio sent notices to about 1.5 million people, about 20 percent of the state’s registered voters, requesting address confirmation to continue on the federal voter rolls.
The state received about 60,000 return cards, or 4 percent of those sent out, confirming the person had moved, Breyer said, and about 235,000 cards came back saying the resident had not moved. More than one million were not returned, which Breyer said was largely due to “the human tendency not to send back cards received in the mail.”
Sotomayor, in her own dissenting opinion, said the ruling “upholds a program that appears to further the very disenfranchisement of minority and low-income voters that Congress set out to eradicate” with the NVRA. 
In his opinion, Alito wrote, “the dissents have a policy disagreement, not just with Ohio, but with Congress,” adding, “but this case presents a question of statutory interpretation, not a question of policy.” It was not the court’s authority to “decide whether Ohio’s Supplemental Process is the ideal method for keeping its voting rolls up to date,” Alito wrote. “The only question before us is whether it violates federal law. It does not.”
Background to the case
The case involved Larry Harmon, a resident of Akron, Ohio, who voted in the presidential elections during 2004 and 2008, and not in the 2012 presidential election or the 2014 midterms. In 2015, he attempted to vote against a ballot initiative and was informed he had been removed from the registered voters’ list. 
State officials said they sent Harmon a notice in 2011 and removed him from the voter rolls. Harmon said he didn't remember receiving the notice. 
In 2016, a Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Harmon, concluding that using failure to vote as a “trigger” to send the notice was a violation of the NVRA. 
The Supreme Court’s majority opinion said, “We reject this argument because the Failure-to-Vote Clause, as originally enacted in the NVRA …, simply forbids the use of nonvoting as the sole criterion for removing a registrant, and Ohio does not use it that way.”

36582,2018-06-12,"13 dead, 31 injured in Afghanistan suicide bomb attack","On Monday, a suicide bombing at a government building in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 13 people and injured 31, according to government spokesmen. The attack occurred at the entrance of the Department of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, and, according to an interior ministry spokesman, the casualties included ministry workers, women and children. A spokesman for the ministry of public health said no children were killed. 

The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the group’s Amaq news agency.
At least three other attacks were carried out in Afghanistan on Monday. In a separate attack, 10 civilians were injured and three attackers were shot dead in the city of Jalalabad, in Nangarhar province, according to a spokesman for the governor of the province. The attackers were killed by security forces when they attempted to enter the city's education department. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Also on Monday, two separate attacks in Ghazni province killed at least six civilians, ten Taliban fighters and three police, Al Jazeera reported.
On June 6, the government of Afghanistan declared a unilateral ceasefire with the Taliban, effective until June 20, the last day of the Islamic holiday of Ramadan. During the ceasefire, the government said military operations against other groups, such as IS, would continue. 
On Saturday, the Taliban announced a ceasefire with government forces for the three days of celebration of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr, happening this week. The holiday will start when the moon is visible, on either Thursday or Friday, according to Reuters. The Taliban said it would defend itself if attacked during the ceasefire, and that it would not include foreign forces in the ceasefire.

36698,2018-06-13,Seattle repeals per-employee tax on companies with $20M in revenue,"Seattle’s city council voted 7-2 on Tuesday to repeal a fixed per-employee tax to be paid by companies with annual revenue of at least $20 million that operate in Seattle, such as Amazon and Starbucks. On May 14, the council unanimously approved a tax of $275 per employee at such companies, with the revenue designated to fund affordable housing, homeless shelters and outreach programs in the city. 
The council said it had expected the tax to raise about $47 million per year. The tax was originally scheduled to take effect in January 2019, and would have expired after five years.
The “No Tax on Jobs” organization supported the repeal of the tax, and was supported financially by Amazon, Starbucks and Northwest Grocery Associated. 
No Tax on Jobs said on Tuesday it had gathered more than 45,000 signatures on a petition to call for a referendum on the tax if the city council did not repeal it. Tim Ceis, a consultant for the organization, said it had obtained more than twice the number of signatures necessary to put a measure on the November ballot for voters to decide on the tax. One Seattle council member, who supported the repeal, said, “we don't have the time or resources to change enough minds to be successful at the polls in November.”
Opponents of the tax said it would have discouraged investment in the city, while supporters of the tax said the presence of large employers in the city contributes to the higher cost of living there, Fox News reported. Seattle does not have a local income tax for individuals who earn less than $250,000 per year.
Council President Bruce Harrell and six other members of the nine-person city council called a special meeting at which the vote was held. During the council’s vote, some people chanted “We are ready to fight. Housing is a human right!” and “Stop the repeal!,” CNN reported. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan supported the repeal.
Amazon and Starbucks officials responded to the repeal. “Today’s vote by the Seattle City Council to repeal the tax on job creation is the right decision for the region’s economic prosperity,” Amazon Vice President Drew Herdener said. “We are deeply committed to being part of the solution to end homelessness in Seattle and will continue to invest in local nonprofits like Mary’s Place and FareStart that are making a difference on this important issue.”
Starbucks Senior Vice President of Public Affairs John Kelly said the company welcomed the decision, and believes it’s “the best path forward is to implement the reforms recommended two years ago by the city’s own homelessness expert.” 
“Starbucks remains a committed partner to government officials, business leaders, and family service providers,” Kelly said. “Together we must work to bring families inside, once and for all.”
Amazon is Seattle’s largest single employer, with about 45,000 employees. The tax would have cost the company an estimated $12.4 million per year. Other businesses that would have been subject to the tax include Nordstrom, Boeing and Microsoft.

36770,2018-06-14,Italy summons French ambassador over Macron’s comments on migrant ship entry denial,"Italy’s foreign ministry summoned the French ambassador on Wednesday in response to French President Emmanuel Macron’s comments regarding Italy’s denying entry to a rescue ship carrying 629 migrants. Macron had said the day prior that Italy had acted with “cynicism and irresponsibility.” The Italian foreign ministry said Macron’s comments were “unacceptable,” and were “undermining relations between Italy and France.” Macron said the two countries should not “give in to emotions.”
Also on Wednesday, Italy canceled a planned meeting between the country’s economy minister and France’s finance minister, with neither office providing a reason for the cancellation. The ministers later agreed to reschedule their meeting, according to a French finance ministry official cited by Reuters.
Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who took office on June 1, are scheduled to meet Friday in Paris to discuss migration, among other topics. Italian news agency ANSA reported that the Macron-Conte meeting could be postponed; Conte’s office did not confirm the report. 
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said, “If an official apology doesn't arrive [from France],” Conte “would be right not to go to France.” France said it had not received a formal request from Italy for an apology, and that it continued to plan for a Friday meeting between Macron and Conte, Reuters reported. Macron said France was “working hand in hand with Italy” on the issue of migration.
Migration in Europe
More than a million migrants have arrived in the European Union since 2015, most leaving the Syrian conflict and, according to the European Commission, up to 90 percent hired human smugglers. 
EU law stipulates that migrants seeking refugee status must apply for asylum in the country where they first enter Europe. The majority of migrants seeking asylum enter the EU through Italy or Greece. 
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 362,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 2016: 181,400 arrived in Italy and 173,450 in Greece. Last year, the total figure of migrants entering Europe was about 105,000. Italy also has an estimated 500,000 unregistered migrants, Reuters reported. So far this year, about 33,700 have arrived, according to UNHCR figures, and about 771 are suspected to have drowned. 
In May 2015, EU leaders drafted “A European Agenda on Migration,” which outlined commitments for EU countries to take certain numbers of refugees. It also outlined other projects to address migration, such as stopping human smugglers, increasing border security, “simplifying” the asylum process and providing development assistance to countries from which many of the migrants originate. In the 2015-2017 period, the EU allocated $20.3 billion (€17.7 billion) of its budget to address migration issues, including providing humanitarian aid.
Salvini, who is also deputy premier and leader of the League party, alleged before the Italian Senate on Wednesday that France had received 640 migrants of the 9,816 migrants it said it would take under a 2015 EU relocation plan. Some countries have received the number of migrants they said they would under the plan, while others have not, according to The Associated Press.
A meeting of EU leaders is scheduled for June 28-29 in Brussels, with migration as one item on the agenda. Last December, EU leaders set the end of June 2018 as a deadline for ruling on a mechanism to handle migrants.
Migrant ships
On Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would receive the 629 migrants aboard the Aquarius ship at Spain’s Valencia port, after Malta and Italy declined to allow the ship to dock. Italy said the ship’s passengers were not in danger and that other European countries should take the migrants.
Filippo Grandi, the UNHCR high commissioner, said, “Closing ports, whoever does it, threatens rescue at sea, as we have seen in the case of the Aquarius, and therefore is not the right solution.” He added that “the reason why Italy said it had closed ports is something we need to listen to.”
The Aquarius, run by rescue group SOS Méditerranée, had rescued migrants from smaller boats in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya on June 9. The Aquarius and two Italian naval ships escorting it are expected to arrive in Valencia on the night of June 16, weather conditions permitting, according to SOS Méditerranée co-founder Sophie Beau. 
On Wednesday, a separate Italian coast guard ship carrying more than 930 migrants docked in Sicily.
Additionally, the U.S.S. Trenton rescued 41 migrants and recovered 12 bodies on Tuesday off the coast of Libya, during what is said was a routine operation. Sea Watch, a German non-governmental organization ship, said it had the resources to take those migrants if Italy agreed to open its ports to the Sea Watch.

36767,2018-06-14,Saudi-led Arab countries begin attack on Houthi-controlled Yemen port city,"The Saudi-led coalition of Arab countries began an attack on the Yemeni port city of Hodeida on Wednesday, as part of the largest battle between the Saudi coalition and the Houthis in Yemen’s three-year civil war. Houthi rebels, an armed political group of Shiite Muslims, have held the city since 2015, according to The Associated Press. 

The operation, called “Golden Victory,” included attacks by air and sea vessels, as well as ground troops, Saudi state media reported. 
About 70 percent of Yemen’s food enters via Hodeida, along with humanitarian aid and fuel. During the initial attacks, the port remained open to shipping, AP reported. Four Emirati soldiers were killed during the attacks on Wednesday, according to United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) state-run media.
Houthis took control of Sanaa, Yemen’s capital, in September 2014, and Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi went into exile. Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of Arab countries to fight Houthis in Yemen since March 2015. Iran supplies the Houthis with weapons, according to the United Nations, the U.S. and other nations.
Yemen’s exiled government “has exhausted all peaceful and political means to remove the Houthi militia from the port of Hodeida,” it said in a statement. “Liberation of the port of Hodeida is a milestone in our struggle to regain Yemen from the militias.”
A military official for the Yemeni government said the Saudi-led coalition had 21,000 troops ready for the attack, including Yemeni, Emirati and Sudanese soldiers, Reuters reported.
Coalition plans
Saudi-led coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki said it plans to take control of the airport, seaport and a route leading to Sanaa. “We will not fight a street war with the Houthis in Hodeida city, for the safety of civilians,” al-Maliki said. 
On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia and the UAE announced a “multi-faceted plan” to protect civilians in Hodeida that involved establishing routes for food, medical supplies and oil from the Saudi city of Jizan and from Abu Dhabi, in the UAE. 
Yemeni civilians
About 600,000 people live in and around Hodeida, according to Al Jazeera. The U.N. said, “as many as 250,000 people may lose everything – even their lives” in the attack on Hodeida. 
The U.N. had been attempting to negotiate a deal to avoid the attack, Al Jazeera reported. Martin Griffiths, U.N. special envoy to Yemen, called on all parties to “exercise restraint

36764,2018-06-14,Fed raises interest rates a quarter point for second time this year,"The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Wednesday it was raising the federal funds interest rate by a quarter percentage point for the second time this year, to a recommended range of between 1.75 and 2 percent. The Fed said, “the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate,” based on information it received since it met in May.
The Fed predicted the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.8 percent in 2018, an increase from its forecast of 2.7 percent in March.
“On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent,” the Fed announced. It also said it would make future adjustments to the federal funds rate, with the objective of 2 percent inflation and “maximum” employment. 
The federal funds rate refers to the interest rate banks or “depository institutions” charge for overnight loans to other banks, which are needed to maintain their reserve requirements, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) website explains. The “reserve requirement” is a minimum amount of money the Federal Reserve requires a bank to have at a given time, often about 10 percent of an individual bank’s total deposits. It is designed to avoid bank failures should depositors make too many withdrawals, according to Investopedia. 
The Fed projected median federal funds rates of 2.4 percent in 2018, 3.1 percent in 2019 and 3.4 percent in 2020. The numbers it projected in March were 2.1 percent in 2018, 2.9 percent in 2019 and 3.4 percent in 2020. 
The Fed forecasted 2.4 percent GDP growth in 2019, and 2 percent in 2020. The forecast for core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is 2.1 percent for 2018, 2019 and 2020. 
The unemployment rate was forecast to be 3.6 percent in 2018, the Fed reported, and would decrease to an estimated 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020. These figures are down from its March projections, which were 3.8 percent unemployment in 2018, and 3.6 percent in 2019 and 2020. The current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the lowest since 2000.
The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate three times in 2017.

36956,2018-06-15,"Drone strike kills Pakistan Taliban leader, Afghanistan says","A U.S.-led drone strike killed Pakistani Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah in  Afghanistan on its border with Pakistan, the Afghan defense ministry announced on Friday. Fazlullah had led the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a separate group from the Afghanistan Taliban, since 2013. 
“I confirm that Mullah Fazlullah, leader of the Pakistani Taliban, has been killed in a joint air operation [with the U.S.] in the border area of Marawara district of Kunar province,” said Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish. He said the drone strike occurred around 9 a.m. local time on Thursday, and also killed two other armed fighters in the Marawara district, near the border. 
A local lawmaker, Sakhi Mashwani, provided a different death toll, saying Fazlullah and five other armed fighters were killed when the drone strike hit their vehicle. He said dozens of TTP associates, including Fazlullah’s brother, gathered to pray after the strike in the Ghaziabad district of Kunar province. 
The TTP confirmed in a statement that Fazlullah was killed, according to Turkish news outlet Anadolu Agency.
Al Jazeera reported that it was unable to independently verify the deaths, due to the remote location of Kunar province. 
U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell said in a statement that the U.S. performed a “counterterrorism strike” targeting “a senior leader of a designated terrorist organization” near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The statement did not confirm any fatalities or name Fazlullah. Later, an official at the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan confirmed Fazlullah had been killed. 
O’Donnell’s statement said the drone strike did not violate a ceasefire agreement that Afghanistan had announced earlier this month. The government had said it would not make offensive strikes against the Afghan Taliban until June 20, the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr. “As previously stated, the ceasefire does not include U.S. counter-terrorism efforts against [the Islamic State and al-Qaida] and other regional and international terrorist groups,” O’Donnell’s statement said. 

Pakistan’s military and ministry of foreign affairs did not comment on the drone strike. 
The Pakistani Taliban
Fazlullah took over TTP leadership when its previous leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November 2013.  
The TTP led an armed insurgent campaign in Pakistan to establish Sharia law (Islamic law) for about a decade starting in 2007. Following Pakistani military campaigns, many remaining TTP members moved to the Afghanistan side of the border. 
According to the Indian research firm South Asia Terrorism Portal, in 2017, TTP and other armed groups killed at least 748 people, including both civilian and security forces. At the TTP’s peak in 2012, it was responsible for at least 3,739 deaths, the firm reported. Pakistan’s military estimates it has killed 4,000 TTP fighters since 2013. 
Fazlullah’s TTP claimed responsibility for a 2014 attack on a Pakistani school that killed more than 140 children and teachers. Fazlullah is suspected to have ordered the 2012 shooting of Malala Yousafzai, who was 15 at the time and later won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work advocating for education for girls. He reportedly conducted public beheadings, including those of police officers. Fazlullah’s age is unknown, but he was believed to be in his late 30s at the time of his death, The Associated Press reported. 
The TTP is separate from the Afghan Taliban that governed Afghanistan before the U.S. overthrew it in 2001.
The U.S. has alleged that Pakistan has allowed the Afghan Taliban to remain within its borders. Pakistan denies this and alleges Afghanistan has allowed the TTP to stay within its borders.

36953,2018-06-15,"Judge revokes Manafort’s bail, house arrest","On Friday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson revoked Paul Manafort’s bail and house arrest privileges, after he was charged with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice last week. He was taken into custody after the judge’s ruling, and awaits two trials in jail. Before the bail ruling, Manafort pleaded not guilty to last week’s charges.
Manafort is scheduled to go to trial in a Virginia federal court in late July to face financial fraud charges, according to CNN. Other charges are scheduled to be heard in a D.C. federal court in September. 
History of Manafort’s case

	In October, 2017, Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed charges against Manafort and his former business partner Rick Gates. The charges included conspiracy against the U.S. and conspiracy to launder money. Manafort posted a $10 million bond, surrendered his passport and was placed under house arrest. 
	In January this year, Manafort filed a lawsuit against Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The suit alleges they “exceed[ed] the scope” of their authority during Mueller’s Russia investigation. 
	In February, Mueller filed new charges against Gates and Manafort, including filing false tax returns, failure to report on foreign accounts and bank fraud. Manafort pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. Gates signed a plea deal and admitted to two charges.
	Last week, Manafort and a Russian colleague were indicted on charges of obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

36950,2018-06-15,USTR announces 25% tariffs on $50B worth of Chinese goods,"On Friday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced a list of Chinese products worth about $50 billion in annual imports that would be subject to 25 percent tariffs. A portion of the tariffs is scheduled to go into effect on July 6. China’s Ministry of Commerce said it would “immediately take tariff measures of the same scale and intensity,” adding that “all economic and trade outcomes of previous talks will now lose effect.”
The USTR listed 1,102 products which will be subject to the new tariffs, with 818 products, worth about $34 billion, to be charged duty beginning July 6. The remaining 284 products, worth about $16 billion, would “undergo further review in a public notice and comment process, including a public hearing” before tariffs are applied, according to the USTR statement. 
The U.S. first announced plans for imposing 25 percent tariffs on Chinese products in April, and China responded by proposing tariffs on U.S. products. During discussions between the the two countries in May, the tariffs were put “on hold,” according to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. At the time, China also agreed to “significantly increase” its purchase of U.S. goods and services. On May 29, the White House announced it would implement the 25 percent tariffs, and said the list of specific products would be announced on June 15. 
The tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against “unfair” or “discriminatory” trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded “the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.” 
The American public will be able to request tariff exclusions for U.S. companies, according to the USTR statement, which said details would be made public in “the next few weeks.”

36914,2018-06-15,OIG report on Clinton investigations: ‘no evidence’ bias affected FBI conclusions; bureau reputation ‘impacted’ by employee conduct,"The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a 500-page report on Thursday that reviewed “various actions” by the FBI and the DOJ ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Regarding the investigation of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while Secretary of State, the OIG “found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations.” The report also examined text messages sent by FBI employees, including FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok, and found his conduct and that of four other employees “impacted the reputation of the FBI.”
The report concluded that in the Clinton email investigation, and a separate investigation of possibly politically-motivated donations to the Clinton Foundation, there was some “poor judgement” and “insubordination” by certain FBI and DOJ leaders, including former FBI Director James Comey.
Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz’ office said it reviewed information regarding six topics involved with the DOJ’s and FBI’s 2016 investigations into Clinton Foundation donations and Clinton’s emails. The topics and the report’s conclusions were:

	Whether FBI policies and procedures were followed in connection with then-FBI Director Comey’s public announcement about the investigation on July 5, 2016, and his letters to Congress on Oct. 28 and Nov. 6, 2016: The report concluded Comey was “insubordinate” in not telling the DOJ until the morning of his July 5, 2016 press conference that he would make a public statement on the status of the Clinton email investigation. The report said Comey told the OIG this was intentional because he was concerned the DOJ would instruct him not to give the press conference. At the event, Comey said Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” in their handling of classified information, and that the FBI recommended the DOJ not prosecute Clinton. The OIG said the decision not to prosecute was consistent.
	Whether decisions in the FBI were based on proper considerations: The report found there was “no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations.” The OIG said it found “they were based on the prosecutor’s assessment of facts, the law, and past department practice.”
	Whether then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe should have recused himself from certain investigative matters: The report concluded McCabe “did not fully comply with his recusal in a few instances” related to the Clinton Foundation investigation. The report also said the FBI’s ethics officials and attorneys “did not fully appreciate the potential significant implications” campaign contributions had to McCabe and the FBI. The contributions were from entities associated with former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton supporter, to McCabe’s wife’s Democratic campaign for the Virginia state senate. Michael Bromwich, an attorney for McCabe, said “any and all claims that political bias or political influence” affected McCabe’s actions are “entirely baseless.”
	Whether then-Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter Kadzik should have recused himself from certain matters, and whether he properly disclosed information to the public: The report said Kadzik demonstrated “poor judgement in failing to recuse himself from Clinton-related matters under federal ethics regulations” prior to Nov. 2, 2016. The report said Kadzik “created an appearance of a conflict when he sent the Chairman of the Clinton Campaign and a longtime friend, John Podesta, the ‘Heads up’ email [in May 2015] that included the schedule for the release of former Secretary Clinton’s emails proposed to the court in a FOIA litigation without knowing whether the information had yet been filed and made public.” The information had already been made public.
	Whether FBI and DOJ employees properly disclosed information: The report concluded the FBI policy which “strictly limits” the employees who are authorized to speak to the media “appeared to be widely ignored” during the OIG’s review period prior to the 2016 election.
	Whether decisions on the timing and method of the FBI’s release of documents on Oct. 30 and Nov. 1, 2016 were influenced by proper considerations: The report found that Comey made a “serious error in judgement” in sending a letter to Congress on Oct. 28, 2016, saying the FBI had reopened the Clinton investigation.

President Donald Trump fired Comey as FBI director last May after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote letters recommending Comey’s dismissal. Rosenstein wrote, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails.” 
Sessions fired McCabe from the FBI in March based on a DOJ report alleging he made an “unauthorized disclosure” to the media and “lacked candor” with investigators about the Clinton Foundation investigation. In April, the OIG sent a criminal referral regarding McCabe to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington. McCabe has denied the allegations.
Texts by FBI agents
The report also contained text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two FBI officials who were involved in the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. Page has since resigned and the FBI reassigned Strzok. The report included a text from Page to Strzok in August 2016 saying: “[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.”
Strzok said his message “was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected, not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation,” according to the report. Strzok told the OIG that he did not take any steps in either the Clinton email investigation or the Russia investigation to affect the outcome of the presidential election.
The OIG said the text messages “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.” It also said, “Our review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.”
Based on the text messages, the report said the OIG did not “have confidence” that one of Strzok’s decisions to prioritize the Russia investigation over the Clinton email investigation “was free from bias.”
An attorney for Strzok, Aitan Goelman, said the OIG’s report was “critically flawed in its bizarre conclusion that the IG cannot rule out ‘with confidence’ the possibility” that Strzok’s “political ‘bias’ may have been a cause of” a delay in obtaining a warrant to investigate emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, then-husband to a Clinton aide. Goelman added that “all facts contained in the report lead to the conclusion that the delay was caused by a variety of factors and miscommunications that had nothing to do” with Strzok’s “political views.” 
Goelman also said Strzok’s “dedication to unbiased service is a fact that would be universally echoed by the thousands of people who have worked with Pete during his 26 years of service in the FBI and U.S. Army.”
The report said the OIG was referring information on text messages sent by five employees to the FBI for consideration of whether they violated the agency’s Offense Code of Conduct.
The report included nine recommendations based on the investigation, among them: 

	having ethics officials consider reviewing campaign donations when DOJ employees or their spouses run for public office; 
	having the FBI consider training, guidance and “warning banners” on its mobile phones for employees on the “proper use” of text messages; 
	making “explicit” the policy that an investigating agency consult with the Attorney General’s office prior to publicly announcing its recommended charging decisions; and 
	considering adopting a policy addressing the “appropriateness” of DOJ employees discussing the conduct of uncharged individuals in public statements.

The report said the Clinton email investigation was one of thousands of investigations that are handled each year by the FBI, with its approximately 35,000 agents, analysts and related professionals. 
The OIG’s report came after an 18-month review with more than 100 witnesses and more than 1.2 million documents.
Responses to the report
The FBI said it “appreciates” the “thoroughness” of the OIG’s investigation, and the OIG’s finding that there was “no evidence that bias or improper considerations affected” the FBI’s investigative actions or decisions. The FBI also said it is “reviewing the recommendations of the OIG and will be taking action.”
Sessions said the report “reveals a number of significant errors by the senior leadership of the Department of Justice and the FBI during the previous administration.”
Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the report ""reaffirmed the president's suspicions about Comey's conduct and the political bias amongst some of the members of the FBI."" 
On Thursday afternoon, Comey tweeted, “I respect the DOJ [O]IG office, which is why I urged them to do this review. The conclusions are reasonable, even though I disagree with some. People of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently. I pray no Director faces it again. Thanks to [O]IG’s people for hard work.”
Comey also authored an editorial for The New York Times in which he elaborated on what he wrote in his tweet.

36862,2018-06-15,Supreme Court rules against Minnesota law banning political clothing at polling places,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 on Thursday that a Minnesota law banning “political apparel” at polls violates voters’ freedom of speech. Minnesota’s law prohibited voters from wearing political badges, buttons or political insignia in or near their polling places. The term “political” in Minnesota’s law could include groups with political views such as MoveOn.org, in addition to political parties, ballot measures or individual candidates.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Minnesota “has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the dissenting opinion that state courts should have been given an opportunity to offer a ""definitive interpretation"" of the law before the Supreme Court ruled if it was a law “capable of reasoned application.”
The case originated in 2010. A Minnesota voter, Andrew Cilek, wore a “Please I.D. Me” button and a Tea Party-logoed shirt to his polling station. He said he was at first not allowed to vote while wearing these items. When he returned to his polling place with his lawyer, he was allowed to vote and an election judge recorded his name for possible prosecution, which could have included a $300 fine. Cilek was not charged for the incident. The Minnesota Voters Alliance and Cilek challenged the law in court, and it reached the Supreme Court upon appeals.
The National Association of Counties said the law helps reduce election day delays and issues. The group said, “for all the progress the United States has made in the past century, polling-place problems are still widespread.”
Roberts wrote in the majority opinion, “Minnesota, like other states, has sought to strike the balance in a way that affords the voter the opportunity to exercise his civic duty in a setting removed from the clamor and din of electioneering. While that choice is generally worthy of our respect, Minnesota has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application.""
Sotomayor wrote in the dissenting opinion, ""Especially where there are undisputedly many constitutional applications of a state law that further weighty state interests, the Court should be wary of invalidating a law without giving the state's highest court an opportunity to pass upon it."" Justice Stephen Breyer joined in the dissent.
All states currently have laws prohibiting direct campaigning or political signs inside or near polling stations. At least nine other states have laws similar to Minnesota’s regarding items voters may wear: Delaware, Kansas, Montana, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Vermont.

36859,2018-06-15,NY Attorney General files lawsuit against Trump Foundation for allegedly violating charity laws,"On Thursday, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation alleging a “pattern of illegal conduct” that occurred over “more than a decade.” The lawsuit alleges “improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations” by the foundation. A spokesperson for the foundation called the lawsuit “politics at its very worst.”
The previous Democratic New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began an investigation into the foundation about two years ago. Schneiderman resigned last month after allegations of subjecting women he dated to “non-consensual physical violence.” He has denied the allegations. Underwood, a Democrat, was appointed attorney general after Schneiderman resigned. She has said she did not intend to run for New York Attorney General in the next election, according to The Associated Press. 
Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop fundraising in New York in 2016 after The Washington Post reported some of the foundation’s spending allegedly personally benefited then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Among the payments cited by the Post were $100,000 to settle legal claims against Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in 2007, and $158,000 paid in 2012 to another foundation to settle a suit over a hole-in-one contest at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York. After the investigation began, Trump’s businesses reimbursed his foundation for these payments.
Underwood said, “As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality. This is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the Foundation and its directors accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.”
A spokesperson for the Trump Foundation said Trump had given more than $8 million to the foundation himself or through his companies, and the foundation “was able to donate more than it took in” because “it had little to no expenses.”
About the lawsuit
The lawsuit alleged that “the foundation’s grants made Mr. Trump and the campaign look charitable and increased the candidate’s profile to Republican primary voters and among important constituent groups.” Tax-exempt charities such as the Trump Foundation are required to follow rules, including not being involved in political campaigns. 
One example presented in the lawsuit alleging the Trump Foundation was used for political gain involved a fundraiser in January 2016. During that time, before Iowa’s presidential caucuses, Trump took part in a rally to raise funds for veterans’ organizations. The fundraiser resulted in $2.8 million in donations to the Trump Foundation, according to the lawsuit. Trump’s campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski, wrote an email to Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization and treasurer of the foundation, asking, “Is there any way we can make some disbursements this week while in Iowa?” The foundation gave five grants of $100,000 before the caucuses, with Trump presenting symbolic checks at rallies.
Underwood referred the findings of her investigation to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action by those agencies.
The lawsuit seeks $2.8 million in restitution, the dissolution of the foundation and other penalties. Trump said he wanted to dissolve the foundation after the election, according to The New York Times. A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office said the foundation “cannot legally dissolve” while under investigation.
The lawsuit also calls for Trump to be banned from serving as a director of a New York non-profit organization for 10 years, and his children, Eric, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka, from serving as directors for one year.
Trump’s response to the lawsuit
On Thursday, Trump tweeted, “The sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me” over the foundation. Trump added, “I won’t settle this case! …” 
Trump also tweeted, “… Schneiderman, who ran the Clinton campaign in New York, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. Now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.”
The 31-year-old Donald J. Trump Foundation has given more than $19 million to charitable causes.

36856,2018-06-15,UN General Assembly passes resolution against ‘indiscriminate force’ by Israel in Gaza,"On Wednesday, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying it “deplores the use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force” by Israel against Palestinian civilians, “particularly in the Gaza strip.” The resolution passed without mentioning Hamas; a U.S. amendment to the resolution that did not pass had proposed “condemning” the group, which rules Gaza. The resolution, titled the “Protection of the Palestinian civilian population,” passed the 193-member assembly with 120 votes for, eight against and 45 abstentions. U.N. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding. 
Australia, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, the Solomon Islands, Togo and the United States voted against the measure.
The resolution, put forward by Algeria and Turkey, said the General Assembly was “condemning all acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation, incitement and destruction.” 
Israeli forces have reportedly killed at least 120 Palestinians since protests began in Gaza along the border with Israel on March 30. Protesters were calling for the “right to return” for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted Palestinians the right to return. The country has used live ammunition and tear gas on protesters. Israel said some of those it killed were armed and that it was defending itself from attack. The U.S. has said Israel has a right to defend itself. Other nations have criticized Israel for its use of lethal force.
The U.N. General Assembly resolution reaffirmed “the right to peaceful assembly and protest, and freedom of expression and of association.”
Some Palestinians have protested peacefully. Others have thrown stones, and flown incendiary kites and balloons with explosives attached to them from Gaza into Israel, where thousands of acres of Israeli farmland and woodlands have been burned as a result, the Jewish Telegraph Agency reported.
The resolution requested that U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres report back within 60 days his proposals ""on ways and means for ensuring the safety, protection and well-being of the Palestinian civilian population under Israeli occupation, including ... recommendations regarding an international protection mechanism.""
Before the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “The U.N.’s incessant focus on Israel not only brings shame to the organization. It also draws attention away from so many other pressing issues that demand the attention of the international community.”
Also before the vote, Palestinian Ambassador and Permanent Observer to the U.N. Riyad Mansour said, ""We need protection of our civilian population.” He said the resolution was ""intended to contribute to a de-escalation of the volatile situation."" He added that Palestinians “cannot remain silent in the face of the most violent crimes and human rights violations being systematically perpetrated against our people.”
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said the resolution was “totally one-sided.” She said “it feeds a narrative to the desperate people of Gaza that their leaders are not responsible for their predicament.” She added that there are “no perfect actors on either side of this conflict. But it does no one any good to pretend that all blame lies on one side.”
The U.S. amendment that did not pass would have “condemned” Hamas “for repeatedly firing rockets into Israel and for inciting violence along the boundary fence, thereby putting civilians at risk.” Hamas is a political organization with an armed division that rules the Gaza territories. Israel and the U.S. have described it as a terrorist organization. Haley said the amendment was “a small step in the direction of balance.”
A U.N. Security Council resolution with similar wording as the one that passed the General Assembly was vetoed by the U.S. on June 1. To pass, U.N. Security Council resolutions require at least nine votes out of the 15 members, and no vetoes from the permanent members: Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S.

36961,2018-06-18,"1,995 minors were separated from adults at border in April and May, DHS says (Update)","The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed Friday that between April 19 and May 31 of this year, 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 “alleged adult guardians” after illegally crossing into the U.S. Children were separated so that authorities could prosecute the adults, a DHS official told reporters. 
On April 6, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero-tolerance policy” for immigrants illegally entering the U.S. or attempting to enter illegally. The policy calls for 100 percent of adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a). Sessions said Thursday that if adults go to a U.S. port of entry to claim asylum, they “are not prosecuted and the family stays intact pending the legal process.”
“If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law,” Sessions said on May 7. Children are prohibited from being put in criminal jails, according to The Washington Post.
 
Minors are then processed as unaccompanied minors through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). They can be housed in government facilities, placed in temporary foster care or released to sponsors in the U.S. The DHS said it does not separate “infants” from adults. It did not provide the ages of minors who are separated from adults. On Thursday, Sessions said that while in HHS custody, children are provided with food, education in their native language, and health and dental care.
Parents or guardians who are separated from children can phone an Immigration and Customs Enforcement department (ICE) hotline or an Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) hotline for information, or to set up lines of communication with children in government custody, according to an ICE flyer. 
On Friday, a DHS representative told reporters that prosecutions for illegal crossings at the border had more than doubled since Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy, adding that it is not currently prosecuting 100 percent of cases. “We make decisions based on the ability to detain and the ability of courts to take these cases, but we no longer exempt categories or classes of individuals,” the representative said. 
“Advocates want us to ignore the law and give people with families a free pass,” said the DHS official, who declined to be named. “We no longer exempt entire classes of people.”
Reuters reported that 1,800 separations of minors and adults crossing the border took place between October 2016 and February 2018. Adults may be separated from children traveling with them if officials suspect the relationship is fraudulent. Reuters reported approximately 13 percent of separations during this period were due to alleged fraud.

37114,2018-06-18,Ivan Duque wins Colombia’s presidential election,"Ivan Duque beat Gustavo Petro in Colombia’s presidential election on Sunday. With 98 percent of the votes counted, Duque received 54 percent of the vote and Petro received 42 percent, according to the Colombian government. Duque and Petro were the only two candidates in Sunday’s runoff vote following the country’s first-round of elections on May 27, in which no presidential candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote. Incumbent President Juan Manuel Santos was first elected in 2010 and was not eligible to run again.
Duque, 41, belongs to the Democratic Center Party. He is a lawyer and formerly worked in Washington, D.C., at the International Development Bank. He became a Colombian senator in 2014. In his acceptance speech on Sunday, Duque said,  ""I am going to give all of my energy to uniting this country” and “I will not govern with hatred.”
During his campaign, Duque said he wanted to change the 2016 peace deal between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). After his win, Duque said, “We’re not going to shred the peace deal but we will make sure that there is peace for all Colombians.” Former FARC commander Rodrigo “Timochenko” Londoño congratulated Duque on winning the presidency. 
Duque’s running mate was Marta Lucía Ramirez. She will become Colombia’s first female vice-president.

37171,2018-06-19,Trump orders establishment of ‘Space Force’ as sixth military branch,"On Monday, President Donald Trump directed the Department of Defense to establish a “Space Force, as the sixth branch of the armed forces.” Speaking at a meeting of the National Space Council, Trump said, “we are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force. Separate, but equal.”
The president did not discuss what specifically the “Space Force” would do, its military role or who would lead it. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said its Policy Board would “begin working on this issue” in “a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.” 
The five current branches of the military are the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Adding a sixth branch would require congressional approval. 
Trump also signed the “Space Policy Directive – 3” on Monday, which directed the U.S. to “lead the management of traffic and mitigate the effects of debris in space.” The military is currently tracking about 23,000 objects in space, according to CNBC. The directive also included guidelines for the design and operation of satellites. 
Last December, Trump signed “Space Policy Directive – 1,” which instructed NASA to return U.S. astronauts to the moon, followed by “human missions” to Mars. In May, he signed “Space Policy Directive – 2” to “reform United States commercial space regulatory framework, seeking to ensure our place as a leader in space commerce.” 
Vice President Mike Pence, who is the head of the National Space Council, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and other council members attended Trump’s announcement.

37165,2018-06-19,Supreme Court rules against plaintiffs in two partisan gerrymandering cases,"On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in two cases related to partisan gerrymandering, one from Wisconsin and one from Maryland. Partisan gerrymandering refers to the division of voting districts in such a way that it favors a particular party, disproportionately for the party’s overall support in a state. The court found that Democrat plaintiffs in the Wisconsin case had not proved they had standing to sue. In the Maryland case, the court determined that the Republican plaintiffs had waited too long to bring their suit forward. Both decisions were unanimous. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering.
Congressional voting districts are based on population, which determines the number of seats each state holds in the U.S. House of Representatives. After a census, voting districts can be redrawn to account for changes in population to maintain a consistent number of voters in each district. (After the 2010 census, congressional districts have an average of about 711,000 people in them.) In the majority of states, the state legislature passes redistricting legislation, meaning the majority party in a state determines the district boundaries. 
Partisan gerrymandering can involve “cracking” and “packing,” two processes that result in so-called “wasted votes.” “Cracking means dividing a party’s supporters among multiple districts so that they fall short of a majority in each one,” according to a complaint filed in the Wisconsin case. “Packing means concentrating one party’s backers in a few districts that they win by overwhelm­ing margins.” 
Such a practice can result in the number of seats each party receives in a state being disproportionate to the popular vote each party received. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled that redistricting that disadvantages minority voters is unconstitutional. It has not ruled on the legality of gerrymandering on partisan lines. 
Wisconsin case
In the Wisconsin case, Gill v. Whitford, the plaintiffs alleged the state’s redistricting plan known as Act 43 harmed “the Democratic Party’s ability to convert Democratic votes into Democratic seats in the legislature.” Act 43 was passed after the 2010 census. 
In the 2012 elections, Republicans received 48.6 percent of the statewide vote for Assembly candidates and won 60 of the Assembly’s 99 seats (about 61 percent of the seats). In 2014, Republicans received 52 percent of the vote and won 63 seats (about 64 percent of the seats).
The plaintiffs said Act 43 “packed” some districts, putting many Democratic voters in a single district, which allegedly “wastes” all Democratic votes beyond the 50 percent needed for election. Other districts, the plaintiffs alleged, were “cracked” under Act 43, with Democratic voters spread across districts with small Republican majorities, and thereby “wasting” all Democratic votes in a district where the Republican candidate wins.
In 2016, a three-judge Federal District Court concluded that Act 43 was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. On Monday, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his opinion, “On this record, it appears that not a single plaintiff sought to prove that he or she lives in a cracked or packed district."" 
The plaintiffs “instead rested their case at trial — and their arguments before this Court — on their theory of statewide injury to Wisconsin Democrats,” Roberts wrote. “The Court has not found that this presents an individual and personal injury of the kind required” to prove they have standing. 
Justice Elena Kagan wrote a concurring opinion, saying, “Given the charges of statewide packing and cracking, affecting a slew of districts and residents, the challengers could make use of statewide evidence and seek a statewide remedy” in the future.
Paul Smith, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs said after the ruling, “the basic bottom line is there will be plaintiffs with clear standing” and “when we get back to the district court we should be in a position to win very substantial relief.”
Maryland case
In Benisek v. Lamone, the Maryland case, the Republican plaintiffs alleged Maryland’s 2011 congressional map for the 6th District constituted gerrymandering. Republican Roscoe Bartlett had held the U.S. congressional seat for 20 years and had been elected again in 2010, winning by 28 percentage points. After the 2011 map changed the districting, he lost the 2012 election to Democrat John Delaney by a 21-point margin. 
In May 2017, the plaintiffs asked the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction to prevent Maryland from holding congressional elections using the 2011 map. The court denied the motion and stayed the proceedings, pending the outcome of the Gill v. Whitford case. The plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s denial and the Supreme Court ruled on whether the lower court’s decision was an “abuse of discretion.”
In an unsigned opinion, the Supreme Court said, “a party requesting a preliminary injunction must generally show reasonable diligence,” and “in this case, appellants did not move for a preliminary injunction in the District Court until six years, and three general elections, after the 2011 map was adopted, and over three years after the plaintiffs’ first complaint was filed.” The Supreme Court ruled the “District Court’s decision denying a preliminary injunction cannot be regarded as an abuse of discretion” and affirmed the lower court’s decision. 
The case will continue in lower courts.

37288,2018-06-20,Eritrea to send delegation to Ethiopian capital after Ethiopia accepted peace agreement,"Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki announced on Wednesday that his country would send a delegation to the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Ababa to “gauge current developments.” Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced about two weeks ago that his country would fully accept the terms of a peace agreement signed in 2000 with Eritrea after a border war between the two nations.
“We will send a delegation to [Addis Ababa] to gauge current developments directly and in depth as well as to chart out a plan for continuous future action,” Afwerki said. “The events and developments that have unfolded in our region in general and in Ethiopia in particular in the recent period warrant appropriate attention.” 
Afwerki said, “Ethiopia is now at a turning point or transition.” Abiy became the Ethiopian prime minister in March. 
Abiy’s chief of staff said the Ethiopian prime minister responded to Isaias’ statements by expressing “his readiness to welcome warmly and with considerable goodwill the Eritrean delegation.”
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia’s east coast, declared its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and a border war began between the countries in 1998. A 2000 peace agreement established a U.N.-supported boundary commission to draw a border in contested regions between the countries. Ethiopia did not accept the commission’s final 2002 border ruling, until the country said earlier this month that it would.
According to Al Jazeera, at least 80,000 people died in fighting between the two countries.

37283,2018-06-20,"Taliban kills 30 Afghan soldiers, captures military base in western Afghanistan","On Wednesday, the Taliban attacked two government security posts and captured a military base in Afghanistan’s Badghis province. The provincial government said 30 Afghan soldiers and 15 Taliban fighters were killed in conflicts on Wednesday. 

The Taliban had announced a three-day ceasefire with the government for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. The ceasefire ended Sunday. A government-declared ceasefire with the Taliban was originally announced to end Wednesday, and the government later said the ceasefire would continue for another 10 days.
Badghis provincial governor Abdul Ghafoor Malikzai said the Taliban attacked two security posts. Some of the soldiers who were killed had been reinforcements sent to aid in repelling the Taliban attacks, said Jamshad Shahbi, a spokesman for the provincial governor. The head of the Badghis provincial council, Abdul Aziz Beg, said the Taliban had captured a military base in the district of Bala Murghab. Beg noted that government forces killed 15 Taliban fighters in other areas of the province. 
The Taliban said on Sunday that as preconditions for peace talks, foreign forces should leave the country and that the Taliban would only negotiate directly with the U.S., Al Jazeera reported. 
U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks. Last year, more than 10,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in conflicts between government forces and the Taliban.

37280,2018-06-20,Canadian Senate votes to legalize recreational cannabis,"Canada’s Senate passed a bill 52-29 on Tuesday to legalize recreational cannabis. Bill C-45, known as the Cannabis Act, was passed by the House of Commons, Canada’s lower parliamentary house, last November. Sale of marijuana to people under 18 years of age will be illegal under the act. A legal cannabis market could be set up within eight to 12 weeks, according to CBC News.
“This legislation will help protect our youth from the risks of cannabis while keeping profits out of the hands of criminals and organized crime,” Canadian Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said.
The bill, which was first introduced to parliament in April of last year, legalizes the carrying and sharing of up to 1.06 ounces (30 grams) of legally-obtained marijuana by adults in public. Adults will also be allowed to grow up to four cannabis plants in their homes. 
Canada has also modified its impaired driving laws to further regulate and enforce the law against driving under the influence of cannabis, including setting legal limits for amounts of THC in the blood. THC is a psychoactive compound present in cannabis.
Provinces will be responsible for deciding where marijuana is to be sold, CNN reported. In Newfoundland and Labrador, marijuana will be sold in Loblaws grocery stores, and in Ontario it will only be sold in 40 state-run stores. Provinces can also increase the minimum age for purchase of marijuana through provincial legislation.
On Tuesday evening, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted, “It’s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalize  regulate marijuana just passed the Senate. #PromiseKept”
Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, former Speaker of the Senate, said, “We have a bill that has an overarching goal to reduce the marijuana use among young people in this country and what it does right off the get go is normalizes it.”
“There's nothing in this bill that indicates to me that we're tackling the problem, which is increased marijuana use among young people,” Housakos said.
Once the passage of the bill is formalized, Canada will become the second country in the world to legalize marijuana nationwide. In 2013, Uruguay legalized production, sale and consumption of marijuana. In the U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia allow recreational marijuana use, and 30 states allow medical marijuana use, CNN reported.
The Canadian illegal cannabis industry is currently worth an estimated $5.3 billion ($7 billion Canadian) annually, according to Canadian Sen. Tony Dean.

37248,2018-06-20,A brief rundown of gerrymandering,"The Supreme Court recently ruled on two partisan “gerrymandering” cases. That news may raise the question: what is gerrymandering anyhow? We answer that question and more below. 
What is gerrymandering?
Gerrymandering is the act of dividing an area into election districts “to give special advantages to one group,” as defined by Merriam Webster. This can be done through processes known as “packing” or “cracking” when a state’s congressional districts are redrawn.
“Packing” is when a district is drawn so that the electorate includes as many members of the opposing party as possible to limit the number of representatives won by that party in other districts. For example, a district could be “packed” with people registered with one party so they win that district by far more than the required 50 percent. This would remove those supporters from other districts in the state so those districts are not as competitive, and can be more easily won by the other party. 
“Cracking” is when the opposing party’s supporters are spread across multiple districts to dilute their voting power and to make it more difficult to win the most votes in a single district. 
Cracking and packing are effective at altering the number of seats each party receives because of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system. Under FPTP, the candidate in a district who receives the most votes (but not necessarily a majority of votes) wins the seat. Whichever party has the most votes in each district wins that districts seat, regardless of the total percentage of of votes that party won in the state overall. (This is different than a proportional representation system that bases the number of seats a party receives on the percentage of total votes it won.)
Redrawing congressional districts is not considered “gerrymandering” unless the district is drawn to deliberately favor one particular group.
What is a congressional district?
Congressional districts are the 435 areas across the U.S. from which members are elected to the House of Representatives. The number, size and shape of congressional districts in each state varies and can change based on population, as determined by U.S. census data gathered every 10 years. Because of this, states need to adjust their districts to ensure that constituents are adequately represented. Each state is responsible for creating and maintaining its congressional districts.
“Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable,” according to the U.S. Census Bureau. “The boundaries and numbers shown for the congressional districts are those specified in the state laws or court orders establishing the districts within each state.”
Who’s in charge?
Rules regulating congressional district boundaries vary by state. In some states, the state legislature controls redistricting. Legislators may vote on a redrawn district in the same manner as any law; and the state’s governor can elect to veto the change.
Other states may limit the governor’s ability to veto district changes. Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Mississippi, and North Carolina approve district lines by a joint resolution that the governor cannot veto, according to Loyola Law School.
States such as Iowa, Maine, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont appoint “advisory commissions” to help the legislature redraw or adjust district lines. Commissions may include state legislators, public officials chosen by legislators or people considered unaffiliated or independent of the legislature.
Where did the term ‘gerrymandering’ come from?
In February 11, 1812, Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry signed into law a redrawn district that opponents said favored his political party. According to the Library of Congress, Republican legislators redrew voting lines “so that the Federalist vote was concentrated in a few districts, while the Republican vote was spread over many.” In the following election, the Republican party won 29 seats and the Federalists won 11 seats. After the governor signed the new district into law, editors at the Boston Gazette compared the district’s shape to that of a salamander. One of the editors reportedly said, “Salamander! Call it a Gerrymander.” (The governor’s last name was actually pronounced with a hard “g,” like the name Gary, but gerrymander later came to be pronounced with a soft “g.”)
Is gerrymandering legal?
The constitutionality of adjusting districts based on political affiliation has not been decided. However, the court has ruled that gerrymandering is unconstitutional when districts are drawn based on the race or ethnicity of the area’s electorate.
The issue of race in redistricting was decided in the case Shaw v. Reno. In 1993, North Carolina sent then-Attorney General Janet Reno a congressional reapportionment plan that created one majority-black district. Reno objected to the new district, arguing that that a second district could have been created to give “minority voting strength in the State's south-central to southeastern region.” The state then added a second majority-black district that stretched 160 miles along Interstate 85 and about the width of the interstate, according to court documents.
Five North Carolina residents then sued claiming that the state had created “an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.” They argued that the districts concentrated black voters “arbitrarily without regard to considerations such as compactness, contiguousness, geographical boundaries, or political subdivisions, in order to create congressional districts along racial lines and to assure the election of two black representatives.” 
In a 5-4 decision, the justices ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The court said that the plaintiffs had standing under the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution, which, among other things, prevents states from discriminating against people based on race. The court ruled that North Carolina’s redistricting “rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race, and that the separation lacks sufficient justification.”",Context|Elections|Politics,USA,,Supreme Court,,gerrymandering|representation,world_news,publish
37237,2018-06-20,US announces withdrawal from UN Human Rights Council,"U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced Tuesday that the U.S. would withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council. Haley said the council showed bias against Israel and granted membership to other countries that she alleged had committed human rights violations. Haley issued her statement at the State Department, alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
“I want to make it crystal clear that this step is not a retreat from our human rights commitments,” Haley said. “On the contrary. We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights.”
Haley said the council showed “disproportionate focus and unending hostility toward Israel,” while it does not “address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member.” With such behavior, “the council ceases to be worthy of its name,” Haley added. “Such a council, in fact, damages the cause of human rights.”
The council currently discusses Israel’s record on human rights at every meeting, according to The Washington Post, and before the U.S. joined in 2009, half the council’s country-specific votes condemned Israel. Council resolutions about Israel reportedly declined to one-fifth of the votes in the first six years that the U.S. was involved, according to the Post. The council has issued more than 70 condemnations of Israel since it was founded in 2006, more than all other countries combined. 
Haley said attempts to “reform” the council were opposed by member states such as Russia, China, Cuba and Egypt. She did not elaborate on the reform attempts.
Last year, Haley said the U.S. would leave the council if it did not revoke the memberships of states considered in violation of human rights, and if it did not take Israel off its standard meeting agenda.
The council was created in 2006 to replace the U.N.'s Human Rights Commission. According to BBC, the previous commission had received criticism for allowing membership to countries with “questionable track records” on human rights. 
Prior to Haley’s announcement, the council was made up of 47 U.N. member states that are elected by the U.N. General Assembly. The U.S. joined the Council, which is based in Geneva, in 2009 under President Barack Obama’s administration. This would be the first time a member state has voluntarily left the council, the Post reported.

37231,2018-06-20,"France, Germany announce jet program, eurozone budget","France and Germany announced plans on Tuesday to develop new combat fighter jets. The French defense ministry said France would take the lead in developing the new aircraft, which would replace France’s Dassault Aviation Rafales and Germany’s Eurofighters. Development on the project is scheduled to begin before the end of year, France’s defense ministry said.
The two countries also agreed that Germany would take the lead in developing a new battle tank, with plans to have it operational by 2035. The first phase is scheduled for completion by mid-2019. The countries announced plans for a future artillery system and a Franco-German military satellite as well.
In a separate announcement on Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron introduced plans for a new eurozone budget to be put in place by 2021. The eurozone refers to the member countries of the European Union that use the euro as their currency. 
The details of the budget deal have not been released. German news outlet Deutsche Welle described it as “single eurozone budget to boost investment and promote economic convergence among all 19 member states.”
“We are working to make sure that the eurozone budget will be used to strengthen investment, also with the aim of strengthening convergence within the eurozone,"" Merkel said.
EU leaders plan to discuss the budget, migration and additional topics at a summit scheduled for June 28-29.

37228,2018-06-20,Pentagon suspends upcoming military exercise with South Korea,"Pentagon spokesperson Dana W. White announced Monday that the U.S. would suspend military exercises with South Korea that were planned for August.
“Consistent with President Donald J. Trump's commitment to North Korea and in concert with South Korea, the United States military has suspended all planning for Ulchi Freedom Guardian, this August's defensive war game,” White said.
White noted that the U.S. was still “coordinating additional actions” and that “no decisions on subsequent war games have been made.”
The South Korean defense ministry also issued a statement on the suspension. “South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom Guardian military drill scheduled for August,” it said.
The U.S. and South Korea have held the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian joint exercise since 1976. The exercise is designed to “enhance readiness, protect the region and maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula,” according to the U.S. Defense Department. Last year, about 17,500 U.S. service members and 50,000 South Korean troops took part in the exercise, which lasted 11 days.
After President Trump’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Trump said he had agreed to halt such exercises, which he described as “provocative” and “expensive.”

37355,2018-06-21,Hungary criminalizes ‘facilitating’ illegal immigration,"Hungary’s parliament passed laws on Wednesday that make it illegal to aid undocumented immigrants. The bills, referred to as “Stop Soros” measures, specify sentences of up to one year in prison for “facilitating” illegal immigration. Non-governmental organization (NGO) workers could be jailed under the new law if an NGO helps or campaigns for asylum seekers, according to BBC. 
The new law would criminalize helping refugees fill in forms or providing information to them on the process for seeking asylum, according to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group.
The new law also makes it so migrants cannot claim the need for protection if they are applying from a country where they are not subject to persecution, such as if they first arrived in another EU country before attempting to enter Hungary as asylum-seekers.
Interior Minister Sandor Pinter said, ""The Hungarian people rightfully expects the government to use all means necessary to combat illegal immigration and the activities that aid it.” Pinter added, ""The Stop Soros package of bills serves that goal, making the organization of illegal immigration a criminal offense. We want to use the bills to stop Hungary from becoming a country of immigrants.""
Amnesty International Europe Director Gauri van Gulik said, ""Criminalizing essential and legitimate human rights work is a brazen attack on people seeking safe haven from persecution and those who carry out admirable work to help them.” 
The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe asked for the vote on the bills to be delayed until it published its review of them on Friday, BBC reported. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe authored the review, and have criticized Hungary’s new law as “arbitrary,” alleging it contravenes European law.
The “Stop Soros” legislation was named after George Soros, a Hungarian-born billionaire who, until last month, had a base of operations of his pro-democracy Open Society Foundations organization in Hungary. The NGO moved to Germany last month, citing “an increasingly repressive political and legal environment.”
The Hungarian parliament also passed a constitutional amendment stating “alien populations cannot be settled” in Hungary. The EU has a migrant relocation plan to distribute more than 150,000 Syrian, Iraqi and Eritrean asylum seekers throughout the EU, according to NPR.
In 2015, 177,000 migrants sought asylum in Hungary. Hungary accepted a few hundred of those applicants, BBC reported. In 2017, the number of applications for asylum was 3,200. Hungarian government statistics show 3,555 refugees living in Hungary as of April. There were 342 registered asylum seekers in the first four months of this year and the government approved 279, The Guardian reported. Hungary has a population of 10 million.

37323,2018-06-21,Trump signs executive order to detain alien families together,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to detain “alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.” The order, titled “Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation,” called for the adjudication of cases involving detained illegal immigrant families to be prioritized, and for government agencies to make facilities available to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for detaining families together pending legal proceedings.
“It is unfortunate that Congress's failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law,” the executive order stated.
During the executive order signing ceremony on Wednesday, Trump said he “didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated,” adding “it’s a problem that's gone on for many years, too many administrations.” The president said that the zero tolerance policy would remain in place, noting, “the border is just as tough. But we do want to keep families together.”
“We are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero tolerance,” Trump said. “We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally.” 
Background
In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero-tolerance policy” that called for 100 percent of adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians.
The Obama administration had deprioritized detainment and criminal prosecution of illegal immigrants who were primary caregivers to children, and some families were held in “family residential centers” awaiting civil penalties for illegally entering the country. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was also able to release families together in the U.S. with electronic monitoring of their location while they were awaiting legal proceedings.
Last Friday, the DHS said there had been about 2,000 undocumented children separated from illegal alien adults over a six week period from April through May. On Tuesday, the department provided an updated figure of 2,342 separations since last month. Images of undocumented children crying and being held in fenced-in detention areas were published in the news media. 
The executive order
The order called for other agencies, including the Department of Defense, to make “any facilities that are appropriate” available to DHS for “the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry.” DHS would be responsible for reimbursing the other agencies for use of their facilities, the order said.
The executive order called for the attorney general to “prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families,” to “the extent practicable.""
In addition, the order called for the attorney general to “promptly file” a request with a federal court to modify the “Flores settlement,” to allow DHS to “detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.” 
The so-called “Flores settlement,” a 1997 court agreement, limited the length of time that unaccompanied undocumented children may be held in immigration detention. A July 2016 ruling in the Ninth Circuit said the Flores settlement applied to both unaccompanied and accompanied children, and that the agreement did not allow families to be detained with children beyond 20 days, according to the American Immigrant Lawyers Association. 
Trump said, “There may be some litigation.” The president noted, “We will be going through Congress. We’re working on a much more comprehensive [immigration] bill.”
After signing the order, Trump said immigrants “can come in through ports of entry if they want, that’s a whole different story. And that’s coming in through a process, and the process is what we want.”
Draft legislation 
At a news conference on Wednesday prior to Trump signing the executive order, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the House would vote on an immigration bill on Thursday. The bill would include provisions to avoid children being separated from parents, Ryan said. “We are going to take action to keep families together while we enforce our immigration laws.”
Congressional Republicans are currently drafting two immigration bills that include potential funding for a border wall, and the possible outlining of a procedure to obtain citizenship for recipients of DACA, who are immigrants illegally brought into the country as children. 
A bill proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that is being considered in the Senate proposes doubling the number of federal immigration judges, limiting the processing of asylum cases to a maximum of 14 days and authorizing new temporary shelters for migrant families, Fox News reported.
Detention facilities and removals
ICE has two family detention centers in Texas and a smaller one in Pennsylvania, with a combined capacity of about 3,000 beds, The Washington Post reported. Nearly 2,600 total beds were occupied in the facilities as of June 9, according to the Post. For adults held individually, ICE leases detention facilities and empty cells from various states and counties. 
ICE had an average daily detainee population of 41,280 during the 2018 fiscal year to date, which, according to the Post, costs more than what Congress has authorized DHS to spend.
In 2017, ICE conducted 143,470 overall administrative arrests, and conducted 226,119 removals of aliens. A removal is the “compulsory and confirmed” movement of an alien out of the U.S. and includes removals resulting from arrests, removals at the border and from the interior, according to ICE. The year prior, under the previous administration, ICE removed 240,255 aliens, 65,332 of which resulted from ICE apprehensions, or arrests. In the past decade, ICE removed the most aliens in a single year during 2012, with 409,849 removals.

37416,2018-06-22,"Officials say 20,000 alien children to be housed on military bases, 500 reunited with families","The Department of Defense (DoD) will house up to 20,000 unaccompanied alien children in the coming months, the Pentagon announced. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made the request, the Pentagon notified lawmakers on Wednesday. Military spokesman Lt. Col. Jamie Davis said on Thursday the Pentagon would support the request.
HHS employees or contractors would provide care for the children, “including supervision, meals, clothing, medical services, transportation or other daily needs,” according to the memo to lawmakers. The occupancies could begin as of July, the Pentagon said. The DoD would be reimbursed for the costs, in compliance with the Economy Act.
Immigrant children have been housed in military bases before. In 2014 under the Obama administration about 7,000 unaccompanied children were housed on three military bases, The Washington Post reported.
Separately, an anonymous official from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Friday that about 500 alien children have been reunited with their families since May. DHS last week said 2,342 immigrant children have been separated from their parents since April. The official did not specify whether the 500 reunited children were still being detained with their families. 
An anonymous Trump administration official told The Associated Press Thursday that federal agencies were working to establish a centralized reunification process for separated families at a facility north of the border in Texas, at the Port Isabel Detention Center.
Trump’s immigration policy
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that directed authorities to detain “alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.” He said his administration would continue its “zero-tolerance” immigration policy that called for all adults who were found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the policy in April. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians.
Additionally, a 1997 court agreement called the “Flores settlement” limits the length of time that unaccompanied undocumented children may be held in immigration detention. A July 2016 ruling in the Ninth Circuit said the Flores settlement applied to both unaccompanied and accompanied children, and that the agreement did not allow families to be detained with children beyond 20 days, the American Immigrant Lawyers Association reported.
Trump’s Wednesday executive order directed the attorney general to “promptly file” a request with a federal court to modify the “Flores settlement,” to allow DHS to “detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.”
Prosecuting illegal immigrant parents
A federal public defender’s office in Texas said Thursday that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would dismiss cases where parents were charged with illegally entering the U.S. and were then separated from their children, the Associated Press reported.
“Going forward, they will no longer bring criminal charges against a parent or parents entering the United States if they have their child with them,” wrote the federal public defender for the Western District of Texas, Maureen Scott Franco, in an email. 
The Trump administration has not publicly said criminal charges would not be pursued.
Immigrant detentions and costs
ICE has two family detention centers in Texas and a smaller one in Pennsylvania, with a combined capacity of about 3,000 beds, The Washington Post reported. Nearly 2,600 total beds were occupied in the facilities as of June 9, according to the Post. For adults held individually, ICE leases detention facilities and empty cells from various states and counties.
ICE had an average daily detainee population of 41,280 during the 2018 fiscal year to date, which, according to the Post, costs more than what Congress has authorized DHS to spend.
According to The National Immigrant Justice Center, congressional appropriations law has required ICE to maintain a “detention bed quota” since 2009, currently requiring the agency to have 34,000 immigration detention beds on a daily basis. The cost of detaining one person per day is about $159, the center reported, at an approximate total daily cost of $5.5 million and an annual cost of more than $2 billion. The ICE 2018 budget places the average cost to maintain one adult detention bed at about $134 a day.
Due to the increase in separations from parents since the zero-tolerance policy was announced in April, authorities have created so-called “tent cities” to house alien children. HHS said beds cost $775 per child per night, NBC News reported.
ICE has used alternatives to detention (ATD) for illegal immigrants who do not pose a risk to public safety to be released while awaiting immigration hearings. ATDs can cost ICE between 70 cents and $17 per person per day, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center, and can include parole, bond, home visits, reporting to ICE offices and GPS monitoring devices.
Immigrant removals
In 2017, ICE conducted 143,470 overall administrative arrests, and conducted 226,119 removals of aliens. A removal is the “compulsory and confirmed” movement of an alien out of the U.S. and includes removals resulting from arrests, removals at the border and from the interior, according to ICE.

37398,2018-06-22,Intel CEO resigns after past consensual relationship,"On Thursday, Intel announced that its CEO, Brian Krzanich, had resigned, effective immediately, over a “violation of Intel’s non-fraternisation policy.” Intel said an inquiry by internal and external counsel had confirmed that Krzanich had a “past consensual relationship” with an Intel employee, against company rules. The chip maker said its current chief financial officer (CFO), Robert Swan, would take the role of interim CEO. 
Swan has been Intel’s CFO since October 2016. His previous experience included being CFO of eBay for nine years.
""Given the expectation that all employees will respect Intel's values and adhere to the company's code of conduct, the board has accepted Mr Krzanich's resignation,” the company said.
Intel board chairman Andy Bryant said the company appreciated Krzanich's ""many contributions.” He also said, ""The board believes strongly in Intel's strategy and we are confident in Bob Swan's ability to lead the company as we conduct a robust search for our next CEO.”
Krzanich, 58, joined Intel as an engineer in 1982 and had been CEO there since May 2013. During Krzanich’s tenure, Intel acquired Mobileye, an Israeli company that produces chips and software for semi-autonomous and self-driving cars, for $15.3 billion. He also directed Intel, which makes chips for personal computers, to increase sales of chips to data centers. 
In January, researchers announced that they had found two flaws affecting Intel chips that could allow hackers to read data stored in memory, such as passwords. At least one of the flaws affected other chip makers’ systems as well. Intel said in January that it had planned to disclose the existence of the flaws after it had made available more software and firmware updates to mitigate the issues.
Krzanich sold about half his Intel stock during the time when the company knew of the flaws and had not yet disclosed them. The company said the sales were as part of a pre-arranged plan and not related to the chip issues. 
Intel also announced on Thursday that it expected its second-quarter revenue to be $16.9 billion, up from its previous forecast of $16.3 billion. It said, “with accelerating data-centric revenue, the company is off to an excellent start in the first half of the year and expects 2018 to be another record year.”

37394,2018-06-22,White House proposes government reorganization,"On Thursday, the White House announced “key reform proposals” for the federal government after a year of planning how to make the government more “efficient, effective, and accountable.” The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed the proposals after receiving input from stakeholders, agencies and the public. Specific proposals include consolidating food safety functions into a single agency, merging the Departments of Education and Labor and creating a new Bureau of Economic Growth.
“Reorganization will help agencies maintain efficiency and effectiveness over time,” according to a White House statement. It also said, “Today’s Federal Government lacks the organization and technology to provide the convenient and efficient services that Americans have come to expect in the 21st century.” It provided what it said were examples of this, including: job seekers having to “navigate” 40 workforce development programs across 15 agencies, chickens and eggs being regulated by different agencies, and small businesses having “overlapping” certification processes when they attempt to work with the federal government.
Digitization is also “a must,” according to the statement, which says the government creates “millions” of new paper documents each year.
The statement said merging the Departments of Education and Labor into a single Cabinet agency was to “better meet the needs” of American workers and students. It said economic assistance resources would be consolidated into a new Bureau of Economic Growth within the Department of Commerce “to increase economic growth nationwide.”
Under the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services would be renamed the Department of Health and Public Welfare to “better capture the nature of its programs.” SNAP, the government’s food stamp program, would be moved to the renamed department from the Department of Agriculture. A Council on Public Assistance would be created in the renamed department to oversee food stamps and Medicaid, and would have the power to implement uniform work requirements across those programs.
Also under the plan, the government would reform the U.S. Postal Service to “restore a sustainable business model” to “possibly” prepare it for “future conversion from a Government agency into a privately-held corporation.”
Director of the OMB Mick Mulvaney said, “This effort, along with the recent executive orders on federal unions, are the biggest pieces so far of our plan to drain the swamp.” He added, “The federal government is bloated, opaque, bureaucratic, and inefficient.”
Some of the reorganization proposals require congressional approval before they can be implemented. 
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said the plan proposed “futile reorganizations of the federal government just to have a new talking point.” She also said Democrats and Republicans in Congress have “rejected” Trump’s proposals to “drastically gut investments in education, health care, and workers.” “He should expect the same result for this latest attempt to make government work worse for the people it serves,” she added.
Some of the proposals, such as moving the Office of Personnel Management’s policy function into the Executive Office of the President, could be done without lawmaker approval, according to OMB Deputy Director Margaret Weichert. 
The plan, titled “Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations,” is 132 pages long.

37389,2018-06-22,Supreme Court: States can charge sales taxes for online retailers with no physical presence there,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that states can charge sales taxes on online sales from companies that do not have a physical presence in those states. The court ruled 5-4 in the case of South Dakota vs. Wayfair that a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that effectively prohibited such sales tax collections was “flawed.”
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, saying, ""the Internet's prevalence and power have changed the dynamics of the national economy. The expansion of e-commerce has also increased the revenue shortfall faced by States seeking to collect their sales and use taxes."" The majority decision also included Justices Samuel Alito, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas.
In the dissenting opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, ""E-commerce has grown into a significant and vibrant part of our national economy against the backdrop of established rules, including the physical-presence rule. Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress.” The minority decision also included Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.
Last year e-commerce retail sales were estimated to be $453.5 billion, according to the ruling. Online retail comprises about 9.5 percent of total retail purchases by dollar value, CNN reported. Prohibitions against collecting all sales tax from online retailers in all states cost as much as $13.4 billion in lost tax revenue last year, according to estimates by the General Accountability Office. 
Wayfair, which was sued by the state of South Dakota, is an online retailer of home goods that did not have a physical presence there. The South Dakota law applied to sellers that did not have a physical presence in the state and delivered more than $100,000 of goods or services into the state per year, as well as sellers with no physical presence who engaged in at least 200 separate sales transactions for goods and services there. Wayfair qualified for the state’s sales tax rules under these criteria.
Online retailer eBay said taxing internet sales would place ""crushing burdens on small online businesses, causing many to curtail operations and damaging the national economy."" There are more than 10,000 local taxing jurisdictions across the country, according to NBC News, and sales tax rates can vary from locality to locality within a state. Internet companies have to keep track of all these rates to know which sales tax to charge on each purchase. In states that pass Internet sales tax laws with minimum sales limits, such as South Dakota, certain online sellers could be exempt from paying sales taxes.
Online retailer Amazon already collects sales taxes in the 45 states that collect such taxes due to having large enough physical presences there, CNN and NBC News reported.
After the ruling, shares of Amazon (AMZN), Wayfair (W), Etsy (ETSY), Overstock (OSTBP) and eBay (EBAY) fell.

37438,2018-06-23,War monitor says Syrian government forces drop barrel bombs on opposition,"On Friday, Syrian government forces allegedly dropped more than 12 barrel bombs on towns in the southwestern province of Daraa, causing property damage, according to the U.K-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It was the first reported use of barrel bombs, which are unguided and also known as improvised explosive devices, in the area in more than a year. The observatory reported it did not have information about casualties from bombs. 

The area is controlled by opposition forces and is part of a “de-escalation zone,” agreed to last July by Russia, the U.S. and Israel. Rebel groups responded by firing missiles at a government airbase in Sweida province, according to The Associated Press. 
The Observatory said at least 17 people have died in the area from government strikes since Tuesday, and 12,000 people have been displaced. 
On Thursday, the U.S. said there would be “serious repercussions” for violations of the “de-escalation zone” agreement. On Friday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said, “the Syrian regime’s violations of the ceasefire in southwest Syria need to stop.” 
In another southern area of Syria, near the U.S.’ Tanf base, pro-government forces allegedly fired at U.S.-backed forces, and later a U.S. airstrike fired at the pro-government forces, according to a U.S. official cited by AP. Syrian state news agency SANA reported one soldier was killed during the airstrike. The Pentagon confirmed a U.S.-backed rebel group near Tanf engaged an “unidentified hostile force,” and said there were no casualties on either side.

37435,2018-06-23,"North, South Korea announce family reunions in August","On Friday, North and South Korea jointly announced they will hold a reunion event in August for 200 family members separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. Each country will send 100 people to a resort in Mount Kumgang, or ""Diamond Mountain,"" in North Korea during August, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry. The nonprofit organization Red Cross will organize the family reunions. 
""The reunion will be held from August 20 to 26, and 100 participants will be selected from each side,"" a joint statement from the Koreas said, after officials met at the Mount Kumgang resort.
The reunions are part of a program the Koreas established in 2000; initially events were held annually, and later decreased. The last reunion was in October 2015, and involved 650 South Koreans visiting relatives in the North. There are 57,000 people registered with the the South Korean Red Cross as being separated from family members. During the Korean War, millions of Koreans were separated from family members on the other sides of the border, BBC reported, some of whom have since passed away. 
The participants from South Korea are selected at random after taking into account age and family background, according to BBC. They will also be subject to medical exams to assess fitness for travel. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to the family reunions during meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in May and U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month.
In a separate announcement on Friday, Trump signed a declaration to continue pre-existing economic restrictions and sanctions on North Korea, including freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction. The sanctions were implemented under George W. Bush, and were continued and modified under the Obama and Trump administrations. 
“The existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula [and] the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea . . . continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” said a notice Trump sent to Congress.

37429,2018-06-23,Supreme Court rules warrant is required for authorities to access cell user location data,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Friday that the government ""generally"" must obtain a warrant to access certain cell phone records collected and stored by wireless carrier companies. The type of information, called cell-site location information (CSLI), is time-stamped records that cell phones generate when they connect to cellular towers. 
The case, Carpenter v. United States, addressed the question of whether accessing CSLI data violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures. The ruling was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented. 
“We decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carrier’s database of physical location information,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. 
Background to the case
The case before the Supreme Court involved Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of robbery in part based on cell phone location data. In 2011, police arrested four men suspected of a series of robberies that took place in Michigan and Ohio. One of the suspects confessed to nine robberies over four months and told the FBI the identity and cell phone numbers of some of his accomplices. 
The FBI reviewed the suspect’s call records and found additional numbers he called at near the time of the robberies. Using that information, prosecutors used the Stored Communications Act to apply for court orders to obtain the cell phone records of Carpenter. The Act allows the government to obtain a court order “if the government entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.” 
After receiving and executing the court order, investigators obtained 12,898 location points from Carpenter’s wireless carriers. Before his trial, Carpenter moved to suppress the CSLI data, arguing the seizure of the records had been obtained without a warrant supported by probable cause and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment. 
Using the location data and testimony from other suspects, Carpenter was convicted of six counts of robbery and five counts of carrying a firearm during a federal crime of violence, and sentenced to 116 years in prison. 
Majority opinion
Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion, “individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the whole of their physical movements,” and “when the Government tracks the location of a cell phone it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone’s user.”
“A warrant is required only in the rare case where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party,” the ruling stated. “And even though the Government will generally need a warrant to access CSLI, case-specific exceptions—e.g., exigent circumstances—may support a warrantless search.” Roberts said, “such exigencies include the need to pursue a fleeing suspect, protect individuals who are threatened with imminent harm, or prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.”
In the 1979 Smith v. Maryland ruling, the Supreme Court said an individual could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in numbers dialed from a phone. The court’s opinion was that information is voluntarily given to a third party: the phone company. In 1976’s United States v. Miller, the Supreme Court ruled that an individual could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in financial records held by a bank.
Friday’s ruling said, “tracking a person’s past movements through CSLI … is detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled” and “given the unique nature of cell-site records, this Court declines to extend Smith and Miller to cover them.”
Roberts also wrote the ruling was “narrow” and “does not express a view on matters not before the Court; does not disturb the application of Smith and Miller or call into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras; does not address other business records that might incidentally reveal location information; and does not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.”
Dissenting opinions
Each of the four dissenting justices wrote their own opinion.
Justice Kennedy wrote that the ruling “puts needed, reasonable, accepted, lawful and congressionally authorized criminal investigations at serious risk in serious cases, often when law enforcement seeks to prevent the threat of violent crimes."" He wrote that CSLI records “are no different from the many other kinds of business records the Government has a lawful right to obtain by compulsory process.” Justices Thomas and Alito joined Kennedy in this dissenting opinion, in addition to writing their own.
Justice Alito said, “the Court's reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of Fourth Amendment law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.” Justice Thomas joined Alito in this opinion.
Justice Thomas wrote: “The Government did not search Carpenter’s property. He did not create the records, he does not maintain them, he cannot control them, and he cannot destroy them. Neither the terms of his contracts nor any provision of law makes the records his. The records belong to MetroPCS and Sprint.”
Justice Gorsuch questioned, “why is someone’s location when using a phone so much more sensitive than who he was talking to (Smith) or what financial transactions he engaged in (Miller)?”

37592,2018-06-25,Saudi Arabia ends ban on women driving,"Saudi Arabia ended its ban on women driving on Sunday, after announcing the decision to remove the ban last September. Women may now obtain licenses after taking a driver’s test, and, in accordance with the culture, can drive with the approval of a male guardian, The Associated Press reported. Prior to lifting the ban, women could not obtain a driver’s license and police enforced the ban on them driving. 
There are four women’s driving schools in the country and two more licensed to open soon, according to the Interior Ministry. The classes, which started to be offered to women three months ago, cost hundreds of dollars and the waitlist for them is months long, AP reported. Men’s classes are less expensive, according to AP.

The classes, which started to be offered to women three months ago, cost hundreds of dollars and the waitlist for them is months long, AP reported. Men’s classes are less expensive, according to AP.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, assumed rule in Saudi Arabia about a year ago and introduced various reforms. They include reducing restrictions on what women can do in public, such as removing a ban on women attending movies or concerts with men. In September 2017, Saudi Arabia announced the plan to lift the ban on women driving via a royal decree announced on national television. At the time, it was the only country in the world that prohibited women from driving, Bloomberg reported. 
Rights groups had advocated for the overturn beginning in 1990, and some women have been arrested and jailed for driving, The New York Times reported.
Some in the kingdom had expressed concern that allowing women to drive could lead to harassment, AP reported. Before lifting the driving ban, Saudi Arabia passed a law against sexual harassment, with sentences of up to five years for the worst offenses, according to AP.
Saudi Arabia legally enforces a system of “male guardianship,” under which a woman has a male “guardian” such as her husband, father, brother or older son. Under Saudi Arabian laws, consent from a woman’s guardian is required for activities including traveling abroad, marriage and receiving certain medical procedures. AP reported that a guardian’s approval will not be legally required to obtain a driver’s license, though culturally it will be needed to drive. 
Saudi Arabia’s senior council of clerics said on Sunday it was religiously permissible for women to drive and in the interests of the country.

37550,2018-06-25,"Erdoğan wins Turkey’s presidential election, unofficial results say","Turkish incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won 52.55 percent of the vote in early presidential elections on Sunday, Turkey’s state news outlet Anadolu Agency reported, citing unofficial results based on 96.16 percent of ballots counted. If the results are confirmed, it would remove the need for a second round of voting. After this election, changes to presidential powers are scheduled to take effect.

Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), and its alliance partner the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) won 342 out of 600, or 57 percent, of parliamentary seats in the general election also held on Sunday, according to unofficial results. 
The second closest presidential candidate was Muharrem İnce with 30.8 percent of the vote. His party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), won 146 parliamentary seats, or 24.3 percent, Anadolu Agency reported. 
Voter turnout was about 87 percent, Anadolu Agency reported, or about 47.85 percent of the approximate 55 million eligible voters. Turkey’s total population is 81 million. The elections were originally scheduled for November 2019, until April this year when Erdoğan called them early. 
In a speech Sunday, Erdoğan said, “This has been another test of democracy and we have passed this test successfully.”
Erdoğan, 64, was Turkey’s prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and has been president since 2014. If his election is confirmed, this will be Erdoğan’s second term as Turkey’s president.
Differing results
The Vice Chairman of CHP said he received official information from the Supreme Election Council that 39 percent of ballots had been counted and Erdoğan had won 51.7 percent of the vote and İnce had won 33.6 percent. 
The CHP said the presidential vote count was not over, and it “certainly” would go to a second round of voting. A runoff election is required if no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote. If required, the next round of voting is scheduled for July 8. 
Constitutional changes
In April of last year, Turkey passed a referendum on constitutional changes in a 51.4 percent vote. The changes, which are scheduled to be implemented after this presidential election, include eliminating the position of prime minister, allowing the president to appoint ministers without parliamentary approval and increasing the numbers of senior judges chosen by the president.  
The referendum vote was held almost a year after a failed coup attempt to overthrow Erdoğan’s government. After the July 2016 coup attempt, which led to 241 deaths, Turkey implemented a state of emergency that is still in place. 
A U.N. Human Rights Office report in March said there had been human rights violations in Turkey under the state of emergency, including arbitrary detentions and torture.

37547,2018-06-25,"White House, TIME respond to magazine cover of crying immigrant child and Trump","The White House on Friday called a TIME magazine cover that depicted a crying immigrant girl superimposed next to President Donald Trump “shameful” and a “separation” from the facts, after the reported father of the girl said she had not been separated from her mother. TIME’s editor-in-chief said the girl had become “the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America” and the cover “captured the stakes” of the issue. 
Last week, the cover of the July 2 issue of TIME magazine became available online. The cover featured a photograph of a crying two-year old Honduran immigrant girl looking up on one side, and a separate picture of President Donald Trump looking down, both against a red background. It appeared as if Trump and the girl were looking at each other. The cover said, “Welcome to America.” 
The cover story is about the effects of the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” to prosecute all adults who illegally crossed the border. The policy has resulted in more than 2,300 children being separated from their alleged parents, according to U.S. officials, before Trump ordered the separations to stop when “appropriate” last week. 
On Thursday, a man in Honduras who said he is the girl’s father, Denis Hernandez, told The Washington Post that she had not been separated from her mother after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. He said the mother and girl were detained by border patrol together. 
On Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted from her press secretary account, “It’s shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda. She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts.” Trump retweeted Sanders’ post. 
TIME editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal responded to criticism of the magazine cover. “The June 12 photograph of the 2-year-old Honduran girl became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason: Under the policy enforced by the administration, prior to its reversal this week, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted, which in turn resulted in the separation of children and parents,” Felsenthal said. “Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment.” 
Immigration policy 
In April, the Trump administration announced a “zero-tolerance policy” that set a goal of charging all immigrant adults found illegally crossing the border with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult jails. Trump’s policy has resulted in over 2,300 separations of alien children from accompanying undocumented immigrant adults.
On Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order to detain “alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.” The order called for the attorney general to prioritize adjudication of cases involving immigrant families, and to file a court motion challenging the 20-day limit on detainment of undocumented alien children, which had been imposed by judicial interpretations of the so-called “Flores settlement.”
On Thursday, Trump tweeted, ""We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!""
The photograph
Pulitzer Prize-winning Getty photographer John Moore took the original picture of the girl, Yanela, standing next to her mother, Sandra Sanchez, on June 12 in McAllen, Texas. Media outlets, including TIME, CNN and The New York Daily News, used the photo in stories about immigrant child-family separations at the border. 
Moore’s original caption on the photo said the mother and child were “asylum seekers” who had “rafted across the Rio Grande from Mexico and were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents before being sent to a processing center for possible separation.” The Honduran government said U.S. authorities detained the two at a facility in Texas, and that they had not been separated from each other, according to Reuters.
Moore said he prefers that his images be used in their original forms and that he was not involved in putting together the TIME cover, according to CNN. He said media outlets can purchase images from Getty and use them in art illustrations.
“The TIME cover is an illustration that interprets a wider issue being reported on within the magazine,” Moore said. “The photograph I took is a straightforward and an honest image; it shows a brief moment in time of a distressed little girl, whose mother is being searched as they are both taken into custody. I believe this image has raised awareness of the zero tolerance policy of the current administration. Having covered immigration for Getty Images for 10 years, this photograph for me is part of a much larger story.""
TIME magazine published a story about the photo last Tuesday and issued a correction in a later version of the article: ""The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she was taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together.”
Descriptions of what happened
Border patrol agent Carlos Ruiz, who was present when officials stopped Sandra and Yanela Sanchez, described to CBS News on Friday morning what he said happened.
“We asked her to set the kid down in front of her, not away from her … and so we can properly search the mother. So, the kid immediately started crying as [Sanchez] set her down. I personally went up to the mother and asked her, ‘are you doing OK, is the kid OK?’ and she said, ‘Yes, she’s tired and thirsty and it’s 11 o’clock at night,” Ruiz said. 
Ruiz said border patrol agents “care” and “treat these people as humanely and as best as we possibly can” while they do their jobs. 
Sanchez’ husband, Denis Hernandez, said she left Honduras for the U.S. via Mexico without telling him, adding that he had not directly been in contact with her. Hernandez said his wife was looking for a “better future,” and wanted to experience the “American dream” and find a job in the U.S., according to The Daily Mail. 
“I didn't support it. I asked her, why? Why would she want to put our little girl through that? But it was her decision at the end of the day,” Hernandez said. He added that his wife was seeking political asylum, without stating the grounds. He said he had heard from his friends that Sanchez paid $6,000 for a “coyote,” someone who smuggles people across the border, to help her cross into the U.S., the Daily Mail reported.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said Sanchez was deported from the U.S. in 2013. At that time, immigration officials encountered her in Hebbronville, Texas, and she was deported 15 days later under “expedited removal.”
Hernandez said he had three children with Sanchez who were still in Honduras, ages 14, 11 and six.

37685,2018-06-26,"Uber to receive 15-month probationary license for operations in London, court rules","A British court ruled Tuesday that the ride-hailing company Uber should be issued a 15-month probationary license to operate in London. After a two-day hearing, the judge said the license could be granted on the condition that Uber is subject to independently verified audits every six months. Uber agreed to report all serious safety complaints, train drivers on ride-sharing safety, and report any major data breaches to the city’s transportation regulatory body, Transport for London (TfL). 
Last September, TfL declined to renew Uber’s license to operate in London due to what it called “public safety and security implications” relating to the company’s operations. Uber appealed the decision and was permitted to keep operating in the city while the appeal was ongoing. 
Dara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia CEO, was named Uber’s CEO last August, after the company’s former CEO Travis Kalanick resigned in June of last year. Khosrowshahi implemented changes in how the company operated, including changes in the U.K. such as adding a 24-hour phone line for driver support, limiting working hours and providing limited insurance. The ruling judge, Emma Arbuthnot, said that with the company’s new governance, it was now fit and proper to hold a private hire vehicles operator license in the city.
TfL's interim head of licensing, Helen Chapman, told the court on Tuesday, ""We've had five years of a very difficult relationship where Uber has felt that they haven't required regulation and being regulated in the same way as everyone else we regulate.”
As part of its hearings this week, Uber lawyer Thomas de la Mare said it accepted September’s rejection of its license application as “right.” Uber also requested an 18-month license, down from the five-year license it had previously requested. Uber said it had passed the TfL’s last three inspections. 
Uber’s U.K. general manager, Tom Elvidge, said the company was “pleased” with the decision. “We will continue to work with TfL to address their concerns and earn their trust, while providing the best possible service for our customers,” he said. 
As part of the agreement, the court ruled Uber would pay for the cost of the appeal, about $562,000 (425,000 British pounds). 
About 45,000 of Uber’s 60,000 drivers in Britain are in London, according to Business Insider. About 3.6 million passengers use Uber in the city.

37657,2018-06-26,Supreme Court rules Trump’s travel ban is within ‘scope of presidential authority’,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s ban on travel from certain countries is “squarely within the scope of presidential authority” under federal law. The “travel ban,” in its current version, is a presidential proclamation that places temporary entry restrictions on nationals from seven countries, five of which are predominantly Muslim. The court ruled that lower courts should now consider the “travel ban” cases before them based on the Supreme Court’s interpretation of executive authority.
The travel restrictions
The first “travel ban” executive order issued by Trump, last January, barred entry for 90 days of people from seven countries with predominantly Muslim populations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Some states challenged the order in court and Trump rescinded it and issued a second order last March. That order had exceptions for travel from Iraq, and stated that the entry restrictions did not apply to those who already had valid visas. 
The Supreme Court unanimously ruled last June to allow enforcement of a limited version of the March executive order, after federal courts had stayed the order. The Supreme Court ruled it could be enforced on people with no ""bona fide"" tie to the U.S., such as having family in the U.S, or attending school.
When the 90 day period from that order expired in September of last year, the president issued Presidential Proclamation No. 9645. The proclamation restricted and limited entry of nationals from eight countries: Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. The administration removed Chad from this list in April of this year, saying the country had “raised its security standards to meet important baseline U.S. national security requirements.” The Supreme Court ruled last December to allow the proclamation’s entry restrictions to take effect while legal challenges continued, after a federal judge in Hawaii had previously ruled to block them.
Ruling in favor of the Trump administration
Tuesday’s ruling was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. 
In the majority opinion, Roberts wrote, “The sole prerequisite set forth in [federal law] is that the president find that the entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The president has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here.”
Regarding his first executive order “travel ban,” Trump said last January, ""This is not about religion—this is about terror and keeping our country safe.”
Roberts wrote that the proclamation “is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices.”
Roberts cited The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which reads: ""Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""
After Tuesday’s ruling, Trump tweeted, “SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!”
Trump later said, ""The Supreme Court has upheld the clear authority of the president to defend the national security of the United States. In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country.""
Question of a religious basis for the ban
In a December 2015 press release, Trump’s campaign called for entry restrictions, citing “hatred” by “large segments of the Muslim population.” The release was titled “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” 
Five of the seven countries currently covered under Proclamation No. 9645 have Muslim majorities: Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In 2010, there were 49 countries with at least 50 percent of the population Muslim, according to the Pew Research Center. 
A lawyer who argued against the travel ban, Neal Katyal, noted in April arguments before the court that Trump had re-tweeted three “anti-Muslim” videos after his proclamation. The videos had been posted by Britain First, a group that opposes Islam and other “political or religious doctrines” it considers “destructive.” Trump later said of Britain First, “If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologize if you'd like me to do that.” 
In a federal court ruling in Hawaii last March that blocked the second executive order on entry restrictions, the judge wrote that a “reasonable, objective observer” would view the order as “issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously neutral purpose.” The judge cited the December 2015 Trump campaign document about Muslims entering the U.S.
Justice Sotomayor wrote in her dissenting opinion in Tuesday’s Supreme Court case, the “repackaging” of the ban as not about religion “does little to cleanse [the policy] of the appearance of discrimination that the president’s words have created. Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.” 
Roberts noted in his Tuesday majority ruling, ""The text says nothing about religion,” and instead was premised on adequate vetting of foreign nationals.

37615,2018-06-26,Rep. Maxine Waters says to ‘push back on’ administration; Trump responds on Twitter,"On Monday, President Donald Trump tweeted that Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.) had “called for harm” to his supporters. He was referencing a public speech she made on Saturday, in which she told her audience to “create a crowd” and “push back on” Trump’s Cabinet members when they are visible in public places, such as restaurants. 
 
 Last week, people approached Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a Mexican restaurant to protest minors separated from the adults they are traveling with, when those immigrants are caught crossing the border illegally as the result of the U.S.’ “zero-tolerance” policy on illegal immigration. Last Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said she was asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia because she works for Trump. 
On Tuesday, government officials confirmed 2,342 immigrant children have been separated from alleged parent guardians since last month.  
Waters’ statements
“If you see anybody from [Trump’s] Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd,” Waters said on Saturday at a rally in Los Angeles. “And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere. We've got to get the children connected to their parents.” She was referring to the issue of minors being separated from adults at the border. 
In an interview with MSNBC later that day, Waters said, “The people are going to turn on [members of the administration]. They're going to protest. They're going to absolutely harass them until they decide that they're going to tell the President, 'No, I can't hang with you.’”
Trump’s tweet
Trump’s Monday tweet read: “Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!”
Waters’ statements referred to Trump’s cabinet, not “supporters” of Trump's movement. 
On Monday night, in another interview with MSNBC, Waters specified that she believes in “peaceful protest,” “civil protest” and freedom of speech, and did not call for “harm” or violence. She called the president a “liar.” She said Trump “calls everybody names” and cited some statements in which Trump has spoken about violence, including saying “I’d like to punch him in the face.” Waters said she was “focused on the children” who had been separated.  
Other politicians’ responses 
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tweeted on Monday, “In the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again. Trump’s daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable. As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.”
On the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, “If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action, and vote them out of office, but no one should call for the harassment of political opponents, that's not right, that's not American.”
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Waters “should” apologize to the American public. “We need civility in this country but the idea that you're asking people to go forward, that becomes very dangerous and it becomes a risk inside our country as well,” he said.
Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) commented on the situation in an interview on CNN on Monday. “To get sidetracked into these debates about whether or not somebody was welcome at a restaurant takes our eyes off of what's going on in America today,” Espaillat said. He added that “Maxine Waters is entitled to her opinion and I respect that.”

37611,2018-06-26,"39 police and others arrested after Ethiopia grenade attack kills 2, injures 156","On Monday, 20 people appeared in an Ethiopian court in relation to a grenade attack at a political rally on Saturday in the country’s capital, Addis Ababa, according to state-affiliated media Fana. The attack killed two people and injured 156, according to Ethiopia’s Health Minister Amir Aman. Nine police officials were arrested for alleged security lapses, including Addis Abada’s deputy police commissioner. An additional 30 suspects were arrested for alleged involvement in the attack. 
The explosion occurred following a speech by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmedat, at a political rally in Meskel Square attended by of tens of thousands of people.
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is providing assistance “to help determine the perpetrators,” according to the head of Ethiopia’s Federal Police Commission Zeinu Jemal. 
Abiy said the people who are responsible for Saturday’s attack “are anti-peace forces.” “You need to stop doing this,” he said. “You weren't successful in the past and you won't be successful in the future.” 
No group has claimed responsibility for the explosion.
Abiy became prime minister in April after former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned in February, citing ongoing “unrest and political crisis” in the country.

37595,2018-06-26,"Mexican federal officials investigate murder of mayoral candidate, arrest town’s entire police force","On Sunday, federal agents detained the 27-person police force and the public security secretary from the Mexican town of Ocampo for questioning about the murder of a mayoral candidate, according to the newspaper El Universal. The victim, Fernando Ángeles Juárez of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), was fatally shot last Thursday. He was running in Mexico’s general election scheduled for July 1.
A group of federal agents from the Deputy Office of Public Security had traveled to Ocampo, Michoacán, on Saturday to detain the public security secretary, Oscar González García, whom prosecutors accused of involvement in Juárez’s murder. The federal agents were stopped by Ocampo police officers, and El Universal reported that the local police fired at the federal agents. They returned in greater numbers Sunday to arrest the entire Ocampo police force, BBC reported. The detainees were taken to the state capital of Morelia for questioning.
Fox News reported that at least 18 candidates, mostly running for local positions, have been killed in Mexico in recent months. Etellekt, a Mexican political consulting agency, reported that 113 candidates, current and former politicians and people attempting to run have been killed since September, and 300 have experienced physical aggression during that time. The elections will determine more than 3,400 local, state and federal positions, including the next president. In less than a two week period, three politicians, including Ángeles, have been killed in the western state of Michoacán, according to BBC. 
More than 15,000 candidates are running for election positions. Mexico is composed of 31 states and one federal district.

37796,2018-06-27,"Supreme Court Justice Kennedy announces retirement, effective July 31","On Wednesday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced he would be retiring, effective July 31. Kennedy said it was ""the greatest honor and privilege to serve our nation in the federal judiciary for 43 years, 30 of those years in the Supreme Court."" 
 
 President Donald Trump called Kennedy a “great justice” and said he would “immediately” begin a search for a replacement, who would be subject to senatorial approval. Trump said his choice of nominee would come from a previously released list of 25 candidates. 
Kennedy was educated at Stanford and Harvard Law School and served on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the western U.S. before then-President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Supreme Court in 1987. He was sworn in the following year.
In a letter to the president announcing his retirement, Kennedy said, ""For a member of the legal profession, it is the highest of honors to serve on this Court. Please permit me by this letter to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know, interpret and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises.”
The Senate will have to confirm any nominee that Trump proposes by a majority vote. Previously, the Senate changed the rules for Justice Neil Gorsuch’s appointment to disallow a possible filibuster, which would have required 60 votes, and thus some Democratic ones, to end debate and call a nomination confirmation to a vote. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate would vote to confirm Kennedy's successor in the fall.
There are currently five Supreme Court justices who were appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democratic presidents. That make-up would not change if Trump appoints a nominee who is confirmed.

37746,2018-06-27,California judge orders separated immigrant children be reunited with parents within 30 days,"A federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday ordering the government to reunite children with undocumented parents from whom they have been separated under the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy.” The injunction ordered that children under five years old must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, and older children must be reunited within 30 days. 
The injunction also ordered that detained parents be allowed to contact their children by phone within 10 days if they are not already in contact with them. The injunction further orders parents not be detained or deported without their children unless authorities deem the adults to be unfit as parents or pose a danger to their children.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) requested the injunction as part of a class-action lawsuit that originated with a case it brought in February on behalf of an asylum-seeking immigrant woman who had been separated from her daughter.
The ruling
In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw wrote that the ACLU and those it represented had “demonstrated a likelihood of success [of their case] on the [case’s] merits, irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities and the public interest weigh in their favor, thus warranting issuance of a preliminary injunction.”
“The unfortunate reality is that under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property,” Sabraw wrote. “Certainly, that cannot satisfy the requirements of due process.”
Sabraw also concluded that “there is no genuine dispute that the Government was not prepared to accommodate the mass influx of separated children.” 
“The facts set forth before the court portray reactive governance — responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the government’s own making. They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution,” Sabraw wrote.
In regards to enforcing immigration law, Sabraw wrote that the injunction “does not implicate the Government's discretionary authority to enforce immigration or other criminal laws, including its decisions to release or detain class members. Rather, the Order addresses only the circumstances under which the Government may separate class members from their children, as well as the reunification of class members who are returned to immigration custody upon completion of any criminal proceedings.”
The arguments
In the filing, the government argued that the court “should give the agencies time to take action, rather than issuing an injunctive order. A court-imposed process is likely to slow the reunification process and cause confusion and conflicting obligations, rather than speed the process of reunifying families in a safe and efficient manner.” Department of Justice lawyers argued that a court injunction would unnecessarily restrict the ability of immigration authorities to carry out their “immigration enforcement mission and address smuggling concerns.”
The ACLU alleged that the government had “no meaningful plan” for parent-child reunifications. Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the ACLU, wrote in the filing, “thousands of families remain separated, and many parents have no idea where their children are or how to find them.” Gelernt mentioned that a phone number for parents to call to obtain information on their separated children sometimes put callers on hold for 30 minutes, and this length of time was “infeasible for detained parents.”
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement over the weekend that the U.S. government “knows the location of all children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families.” DHS said that 522 children had been reunited with their parents since May. “This process is well coordinated,” DHS said.
Lawyers for the government argued that Trump’s executive order last week had addressed the issue of future family separations. The ACLU noted that the president could rescind executive orders at any time and that the order did not eliminate the need for an injunction.
After the ruling, Gelernt said, “This is a complete victory for these families and children who have been suffering for months.”
A Justice Department spokesperson said the decision “makes it even more imperative that Congress finally act to give federal law enforcement the ability to simultaneously enforce the law and keep families together.”
Background on the immigration policy
The Trump administration announced a “zero-tolerance policy” in April that called for all adults who were found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians. Last week, Trump issued an executive order that directed immigration authorities to detain “alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.”  
DHS said last week 2,342 immigrant children had been separated from their parents since April. The Secretary for Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, said on Tuesday that the department has 2,047 immigrant children in its custody.

37716,2018-06-27,Syrian government continues southwest offensive; Jordan will not accept Syrian refugees,"Syria continued an offensive on rebel-held areas in the country’s southwest on Tuesday. The U.N. has said more than 45,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in Daraa province since a government offensive began on June 19. Also on Tuesday, Jordan indicated it would not open its borders to accept Syrians fleeing the attacks, saying it was “at capacity.” 
“Jordan [is] engaging all parties to end fighting, protect civilians in south [Syria],”Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi tweeted on Tuesday. “Host to 1.3 [million] Syrians, we are at capacity. We’ll keep doing all we can for them. But we can’t host more.”
A commander for the forces that back the Syrian government said one of the goals of the attacks in the southwest was to take control of the Nassib crossing, an international border crossing between Syria and Jordan that has been held by rebel forces since 2015, Reuters reported. 
The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian government forces had taken the town of Busra al-Harir in northeastern Daraa. ""At least 200 air strikes and 150 barrel bombs targeted Bursa al-Harir this morning as government forces moved in on the village,” according to Jihad Hamza, a pro-opposition activist in Daraa.
A “de-escalation” agreement to cease fighting between rebels and Syrian forces in certain zones in southwest Syria, including Daraa, had been negotiated and signed last July by the U.S., Russia and Jordan. Syria's offensive is in de-escalation zones. 
Since Syria began its southwest offensive on June 19, at least 41 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded, according to Lawrence Adam, a journalist with the Nabaa media group. Adam said at least 27 of the dead were civilians.
Rebels from the Free Syrian Army showed Reuters a message from U.S. officials that said rebels should not expect U.S. military support against the government offensive. A U.S. State Department official told Reuters, “We are concerned by developments in southwest Syria, particularly the intensification of Russian airstrikes and pro-regime ground attacks. This is once again an example of Russia violating arrangements it has entered into with no regard for civilian lives.”
A spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said an airstrike had put a hospital out of operation and that five of its aid facilities in the south were out of service during the government attacks.
State media reported that government forces had been bombing “terrorist posts” northeast of Daraa. 
The Observatory and Syrian state news agency SANA reported that two Israeli missiles had hit near Damascus airport overnight Monday. An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on the reports. Syrian rebels currently control territory along the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. One goal of the Syrian government offensive is to retake that area, according to Al Jazeera.
The Syrian civil war has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions since its start in 2011. Syrian government forces took control of Eastern Ghouta in April after it began an offensive there in February. 
Nearly all the northern border with Turkey and some of eastern Syria remain controlled by non-government groups, Reuters reported.

37703,2018-06-27,17 states sue Trump administration over family separations,"Seventeen states plus the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking the reunification of separated immigrant families. The states, all with Democratic attorneys general, including California, New York and Washington, filed the suit in a federal court in Seattle. 
 
 President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week to detain alien families together “where appropriate,” without commenting on what would happen with families that were already separated. 
The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration ""violated the constitutional due process rights of the parents and children by separating them as a matter of course and without any finding that the parent poses a threat to the children,"" according to the New York Attorney General's Office.
It also alleges that the practice of family separations is ""irrationally discriminatory"" and violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection ""because it targets only people crossing our southwestern border, the majority of whom are from Latin America, and not anyone crossing the northern border or entering the United States elsewhere,"" according to the New York Attorney General’s Office.
""The Court should order Defendants to reunite every family separated by these unlawful acts immediately,"" the lawsuit reads.
The states that sued are California, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
In a separate case in a San Diego federal court, a judge is considering a request brought by the American Civil Liberties Union to issue an injunction ordering the administration to reunite separated children with their parents.

On Monday, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would stop referring cases for criminal prosecution involving undocumented parents who arrived in the U.S. with their children, unless the child was in danger or the adult had a criminal record. McAleenan said ICE does not have enough detention space to accommodate all undocumented immigrant families. 
On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. was not changing its zero-tolerance policy. “We’re simply out of resources,” she said. “We’re working with Congress, hopefully, to provide more resources and the ability to actually enforce the law.”

On Wednesday, Trump said the leaders would discuss Syria, Ukraine and other issues. 
Trump also said, “Getting along with Russia and with China and with everybody is a very good thing. It’s good for the world, it’s good for us, it’s good for everybody.”
On Wednesday, National Security Adviser John Bolton held talks with Russian officials regarding the summit. Bolton said he expected Trump and Putin to discuss issues that include arms control, alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and the possibility of Russia rejoining the G8, RT reported. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov may meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the next two weeks in preparation for the summit.
Trump and Putin have previously met in person on two occasions. They met for about two hours during the G20 summit in Germany in July 2017, and, according to Trump, had “two or three very short conversations” at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam last November.
Trump is scheduled to attend a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, from July 11-12. He is also scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May on July 13.

37805,2018-06-28,"US Defense Secretary Mattis meets Chinese President Xi, defense minister in 3-day Beijing visit","On Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a three-day visit to China that began Tuesday. Mattis said he was visiting because of the importance that ""we in the U.S. military place on the military-to-military relationship” with the Chinese. Xi said relations between the two countries’ militaries is a ""model component of our overall bilateral relations."" Prior to meeting Xi, Mattis met with Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, with whom he said he had a ""very open and honest dialogue.""
“I'm here to keep our relationship on a great trajectory, going in the right direction,” Mattis said.
On Sunday, before leaving for his Asia trip, Mattis said he hoped to establish a ""transparent strategic dialogue"" with his Chinese counterparts. ""Going forward, we obviously look at the actions of China, but I am going there to do a lot of listening and identification of common ground and uncommon ground on the strategic level at this time,"" he said.
""I did not want to immediately go in with a certain preset expectation of what they are going to say,” Mattis said before the meeting. “I want to go in and do a lot of listening. I will be very clear about what we see developing, but that's the whole reason I am making the trip instead of just sitting in Washington reading news reports, intelligence reports or analyst reports.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Wednesday it was ""natural that China and the U.S. have differences in different times and aspects as two big countries."" He said, “The key part is solving the issues between the U.S. and China with mutual respect. We have always believed that the bilateral relationship can benefit both countries and both peoples."" 
Xi said China will remain on a path of peaceful development and not pursue expansionism and colonialism, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported, adding that common ground between the two countries “far outweighs differences.” Xi said he hoped the two militaries would “strengthen communication, increase mutual trust, deepen cooperation,” and “promote military ties to be a stabilizer of bilateral relations,” according to Xinhua. 
The Chinese president said, according to Xinhua, that China’s stance “is steadfast and clear-cut when it comes to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,” and that ""any inch of territory passed down from ancestors can not be lost while we want nothing from others.” China claims historical sovereignty over the South China Sea, including man-made islands, as well as sovereignty over Taiwan and Tibet. The claims are internationally disputed.
Mattis, a retired Marine general, is the first secretary of defense to visit China since 2014. After his Beijing visit, Mattis is scheduled to meet with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo in Seoul, and later with Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera in Tokyo.
Recent developments in U.S.-China relations
In April, China’s aviation authority informed 36 international airlines, including U.S.-based ones, that if they did not show Taiwan, and Hong Kong and Macau as Chinese territories on their websites, there could be disruptions to their operations in China. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called this part of a “growing trend” by the Chinese Communist Party to “impose its political views on American citizens and private companies.”
Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, with a minority of countries recognizing its sovereignty as a nation independent of China.
The U.S. continues to sell weapons to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, according to CNN. This year, the Trump administration authorized U.S. companies to sell submarine technology to Taiwan. In March, the U.S. passed the Taiwan Travel Act that permits and “encourages” official visits between the U.S. and Taiwan.
Last month, the U.S. disinvited China from RimPac military exercises which started on Wednesday with more than two dozen countries. The Pentagon said the decision was a response to China’s military presence in the South China Sea, and its placing of missile systems on man-made islands there. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s military presence on South China Sea islands was “out of necessary defense purposes” and has “nothing to do with militarization.” 
The U.S. has also performed “freedom of navigation” exercises in the South China Sea “in order to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.”
On June 15, the U.S. announced 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, with tariffs on about $34 billion of them scheduled to go into effect on July 6. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said, “the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.” China also announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of $34 billion worth of U.S. goods to come into effect on July 6.

37793,2018-06-28,Supreme Court rules public-sector labor unions can’t require fees from nonmembers,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that requiring non-union employees to pay public sector labor union fees for collective bargaining violated First Amendment rights. In the case, Mark Janus, an Illinois public-sector employee, argued positions that unions take during collective bargaining with the government are inherently political. He argued that under the First Amendment, he should not be required to support the political activity of collective bargaining by paying for labor union fees, and the court agreed in a 5-4 decision.
In the case, titled “Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31,” the court overturned a 1977 ruling on “Abood v. Detroit Board of Education.” The Abood ruling had allowed the requirement of non-union members to pay fees for issues such as employee grievances, physical safety and training while not allowing the requirement of fees for a union’s political activities such as paying for political advertisements. The court said the Abood ruling was “unworkable” due to “vagueness.” Justice Elena Kagan said in her dissenting opinion that it “has proved workable” and “no recent developments have eroded its underpinnings.”
Majority and dissenting opinions
Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion, ""It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment. Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.”
""We recognize that the loss of payments from nonmembers may cause unions to experience unpleasant transition costs in the short term, and may require unions to make adjustments in order to attract and retain members,” Alito wrote. “But we must weigh these disadvantages against the considerable windfall that unions have received under Abood for the past 41 years.""
Kagan wrote in her dissent, ""The First Amendment was meant for better things. It was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governance—including over the role of public-sector unions.""
Wednesday’s ruling was supported by Justices appointed by Republican presidents and opposed by Justices appointed by Democratic presidents. In the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. 
Effects of the ruling
The Illinois law considered by the court required government workers who did not join a union to “pay their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.” More than 20 states currently have laws that allow unions to require non-union members to pay for collective bargaining, according to The New York Times. With the ruling, those laws would not apply for public-sector unions.
In the majority opinion, the court cited an opinion in a 2014 Supreme Court case that said, “In the public sector, core issues such as wages, pensions, and benefits are important political issues, but that is generally not so in the private sector.” The ruling should not generally apply to private sector unions.
In 2017, 34.4 percent of public-sector workers were in unions and 6.5 percent of private-sector workers were in unions, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

37966,2018-06-29,DOJ charges 601 people for alleged health care fraud,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced charges against 601 people on Thursday for alleged participation in health care fraud activities, saying it was the “largest health care fraud enforcement action in American history.” The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged the defendants were involved in a total of more than $2 billion in false billings to insurers for medically unnecessary prescription drugs and compounded medications that were never purchased or distributed to beneficiaries. 
The alleged fraud involved false billing to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE military health insurance and private insurance companies, according to the DOJ. The 601 defendants include 165 doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals. 
Of the defendants, 162, including 76 doctors, were charged for participating in prescribing and distributing opioids and other narcotics. The charges, while announced together, include a number of unrelated cases, including 84 opioid cases involving more than 13 million illegal doses of opioids.
Sessions made the announcement along with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, as well as representatives from the Drug Enforcement Agency, FBI and other federal agencies.
“Healthcare fraud touches every corner of the United States and not only costs taxpayers money, but also can have deadly consequences,” said FBI Deputy Director Bowdich. He thanked law enforcement agencies for their investigations. 
The HHS also announced Thursday that between July 2017 and the present, it has excluded 2,700 health care providers from participation in any federal health care programs, such as Medicare, for alleged misconduct. That figure includes 587 providers who were allegedly involved in “opioid diversion and abuse.” Drug diversion is generally defined as the process when legal distribution of prescription drugs is disrupted and the drugs are then distributed illegally. 
Approximately 64,000 people died in the U.S. from drug overdoses in 2016, The Washington Post reported. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than 42,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths in the U.S. that year.
Last year, the DOJ charged more than 400 people for allegedly participating in health care fraud activities totaling approximately $1.3 billion in false billings.

37875,2018-06-29,Mexico to hold presidential election on Sunday,"Mexico’s presidential candidates held rallies on Wednesday ahead of Sunday’s vote to replace incumbent President Enrique Peña Nieto. The four candidates on the ballot include Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement (Morena party), former Finance Minister José Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), former Speaker of Congress Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party (PAN) and Jaime Rodríguez Calderón, who is running as an independent. Three polls indicated López Obrador has a lead of more than 20 points in the race.
By law, Wednesday was the last day of the campaign season, according to The Associated Press. López Obrador, whom the media describes as a “leftist,” held a rally in Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium with a crowd of nearly 100,000 people, AP reported. Anaya, whom the media describes as “conservative,” held a rally in Guanajuato state. Meade, 49, held events in Coahuila and Nuevo León states.
López Obrador, 64, said at the rally, “The policies we’ve been applying for the past 30 years haven’t worked. We haven’t even had economic growth. What’s grown is corruption, poverty, crime and violence. That’s why we’re going to send their policies to the dustbin of history.”
Anaya, 39, said in León, Guanajuato, ""Our coalition is the only one that can beat López Obrador.” He added, ""I'm calling on all good people, including those in other parties, those with no party … I am explicitly calling on you to cast a pragmatic vote.""
Meade said, “The silent majority will win us this election.” 
The PRI governed Mexico for 71 years before the PAN won the presidency in 2000. Peña Nieto is a member of the PRI party. López Obrador, formerly of the PRI and then of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), founded Morena in 2014.
López Obrador, who is often referred to as AMLO, was Mexico City’s mayor from 2000 to 2005 and is in his third campaign for the presidency.
In Mexico, presidents are limited to one six-year term. The president is elected by popular vote and there is no run-off system, according to the Mexican National Electoral Institute. The new president will take office on Dec. 1.
Eighty-seven million Mexicans are registered to vote, and hundreds of federal and state legislators, mayors and eight governors will be on ballots across the country. The National Electoral Institute said results will be announced around 11 p.m. local time on Sunday.
The polls
Polls by newspapers Reforma and El Financiero, as well as by polling firm Parametria, showed López Obrador was projected to win about 51 to 54 percent of the votes. The number of people who did not choose a candidate in the polls ranged between 15 and 29 percent. The Reforma poll of 1,200 registered voters with a margin of error of four percentage points had López Obrador at 51 percent of the vote, Anaya at 27 percent and Meade at 19 percent. Parametria also had Anaya in second place, while El Financiero had Meade in second place.
A Berumen poll indicated Sunday’s elections could result in the PRI losing about half its seats in congress. Parametria’s poll put the Morena party at 41 percent of the vote for the lower house of Congress after excluding people who did not choose a candidate in the survey. The same poll had Morena with 38 percent of the vote for the senate, with the PAN in second place. The sample size of the poll was not large enough to project the number of seats to be won by the parties in either house, according to Reuters.
The Consulta Mitofsky polling group estimated that PAN could lose a quarter of its seats in the chamber of deputies and more than half in the senate, Financial Times reported.
Issues in Mexico
A 2017 survey of 1,000 Mexicans by the Pew Research Center found that 13 percent were satisfied and 85 percent dissatisfied with the way things were going in their country. The top eight “very big problems” identified by survey participants were crime, corrupt political leaders, drug cartel-related violence, rising prices, corrupt police officers, lack of employment opportunities, poor-quality schools, and the gap between rich and poor.
There were a record 25,000 murders in Mexico last year, according to AFP. Etellekt, a risk analysis consulting company, reported 48 killings of candidates for local office during this campaign.
According to the Mexican government, 43.6 percent of the country’s population was poor in 2016 (equivalent to 53.4 million out of a total 122 million), while 7.6 percent was in extreme poverty, meaning they cannot afford basic items. In 2014, the government defined the poverty line as living on no more than $2,542 pesos ($157.70) per month in cities, and $1,615 pesos (about $100) in rural areas, with incomes for “extreme poverty” amounting to about half those numbers. In its poverty calculations, the government also considers other factors such as healthcare and education, Reuters reported.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Mexican unemployment rate was 3.2 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). OECD notes that “unemployed people are those who report that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks.” Individuals who have stopped looking for work are not included in the unemployment numbers.
López Obrador’s proposals
López Obrador has proposed reviewing existing contracts under which some of the oil sector was privatized during Peña Nieto’s tenure. López Obrador has said he would halve the presidential salary and continue living in his own house, if elected. ""I'm going to govern by example, with austerity,” he has said. 
He also said he would reduce poverty and unemployment, and eliminate Mexico’s secret service and intelligence agency. 
López Obrador has said he would implement agricultural subsidies, higher pensions, and monetary grants or apprenticeships for young people who are not working or in school, according to Shannon O’Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Anaya’s proposals
Anaya, who was formerly president of the PAN, has proposed a universal minimum income and an international commission to investigate alleged corruption by the current government, Reuters reported.
Meade’s proposals
Meade has proposed pursuing drug cartels’ finances, increasing teachers’ pay and keeping structural reforms implemented under Peña Nieto, according to The Guardian. He has also said he would reduce corruption.

37872,2018-06-29,"At least 5 killed, 2 others injured at Maryland newspaper shooting; male suspect in custody (Update)","A male shooter killed at least five people and injured two others at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday. Anne Arundel County police said only one suspect was involved and that he was in custody. The shooting occurred around 2:40 p.m. local time. Police evacuated the building, sending people to a nearby mall while authorities searched the premises. 
Police identified the suspect as a 38-year old Laurel, Maryland, resident. They said he used a shotgun and “smoke grenades.” Authorities charged the suspect with five counts of first-degree murder.
The suspect had lost a defamation case against a columnist and an editor for the Gazette in 2015, according to the Baltimore Sun. He had alleged the paper had defamed him in a 2011 column it ran that covered his guilty plea for criminal harassment of a woman via social media. Neither the columnist nor the editor in that case were present during the shooting, and they are no longer employed by the paper.
Anne Arundel County Deputy Police Chief William Krampf said, “This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette. This person was prepared today to come in. He was prepared to shoot people.” Police said about 170 people were in the building at the time of the shooting. The Anne Arundel County executive said police found the gunman hiding beneath a desk in the newsroom.
Phil Davis, a courts and crime reporter for the Capital Gazette, tweeted, “Gunman shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees.”
Davis also tweeted, “There is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you're under your desk and then hear the gunman reload.” He later tweeted, “I was not tweeting from under my desk. I was already safe when I started tweeting.”
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) tweeted, “Absolutely devastated to learn of this tragedy in Annapolis.” He added, “Please, heed all warnings and stay away from the area. Praying for those at the scene and for our community.”
The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were reportedly on the scene investigating. ATF can aid in tracing weapons, according to The Baltimore Sun, which owns the Capital Gazette. The Sun reported that police were on the scene within a minute of being called, and that police were sent to its site in Baltimore as a precaution.

37837,2018-06-29,Australia passes laws against foreign interference in domestic elections,"On Thursday, Australia’s parliament passed laws against foreign interference in elections and domestic affairs, as well as against espionage. The new laws require foreign government lobbyists to register with the Australian government. The laws also make stealing trade secrets on behalf of a foreign government a criminal offense and they impose new, larger penalties on those who disclose classified government information. The laws add 38 new crimes, with punishments ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison, according to The New York Times.
Under the laws, journalists can use a legal defense of reporting in the “public interest” if they are found to possess or publish classified information.
The laws make it illegal for people to act covertly on behalf of a foreign government to influence Australian elections, such as by organizing rallies. The laws also make it a crime to assist foreign spies in Australia and to damage economic relations with other countries. Damaging “critical infrastructure,” which includes cyberattacks on networks such as energy grids and transport systems, is also a crime under the new laws, SBS News reported. 
In December, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said, “Foreign powers are making unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process, both here and abroad.” He added, “Media reports have suggested that the Chinese Communist Party has been working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and even the decisions of elected representatives right here in this building. We take these reports very seriously.”
Lu Kang, spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said the country does not interfere in other countries’ affairs, the Times reported. Kang said, “We hope that all countries could cast off [a] Cold War mind-set and strengthen exchanges and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and equal treatment.”
The new laws allow the attorney general to name individuals as foreign agents without due process, according to the Times.
Greens party Senator Nick McKim said, “We will strongly oppose this legislation because of its impacts on freedom of speech, public interest journalism and non-violent protest.”
Australian Attorney General Christian Porter said, “The practices of modern espionage are now being encountered in so many Western democracies around the globe.” He added, “To counter this threat, Australia must have a robust, modern legislative framework to ensure our law enforcement and national security agencies are sufficiently empowered to investigate and disrupt malicious foreign interference.”
The government is planning future legislation to ban foreign political donations.

38018,2018-06-30,Portugal’s Vitorino named new head of UN migration agency,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM) selected Portuguese politician António Vitorino as its director general on Friday, after U.S. candidate Ken Isaacs was eliminated during voting. 
Isaacs was eliminated after three rounds of voting, according to AFP. The current deputy director general, Laura Thompson from Costa Rica, then removed herself from the running and Vitorino won by acclamation, AFP reported. The ballots were secret, NBC News reported. 
Vitorino is scheduled to take over from the current director, U.S. diplomat William Lacy Swing, on Oct. 1, according to an IOM statement. Vitorino will be the second non-American head of the agency since it was founded in 1951.
Vitorino’s career
In the 1990s, Vitorino served as Portugal's deputy prime minister and defense minister, working under António Guterres, the current U.N. secretary general. Vitorino resigned from the Portuguese parliament in 1997, following media reports that raised questions about whether he had paid his property taxes in full. He then served as the European justice commissioner between 1999 and 2004.
Migration is a ""triple win for countries of origin, for countries of destination but above all for the migrants themselves,” Vitorino said at an event earlier this month. He said there’s a need to “build a broad consensus in the international area about the advantages of migration,” adding that organizations like the IOM can aid in that. 
Context of Isaacs vote
Isaacs, a vice president of a Christian humanitarian aid Samaritan's Purse, was nominated by President Donald Trump to the IOM position in February. After his nomination, news media reported on some of Isaacs' social media posts that were critical of Islam, such as him saying, “Islam is not peaceful” after a 2016 attack in the French city of Nice for which Islamic State claimed responsibility. Isaacs made his Twitter account private after the media coverage; he did not deny making the comments. 
The Trump administration has recently criticized other U.N. bodies, and the U.S. withdrew from the U.N. Human Rights Council earlier this month, citing an alleged anti-Israel bias. Also earlier this month, the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, criticized the Trump administration’s policy of separating immigrant families, calling it “unconscionable,” before Trump announced a change in the policy. 
Isaacs did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment about the IOM vote. 
The IOM
The IOM is “dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all,” by “providing services and advice to governments and migrants.” It also works to “promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants,” according to its website. The Geneva-based organization has 169 member states, plus eight nations with observer status, and field offices in more than 100 countries. 
The IOM was headed by an American from 1951 to 1961, and then again from 1969 until now. In 2016, it became affiliated with the United Nations.

37999,2018-06-30,"New California laws to regulate consumer data collection, prohibit taxes on soda","California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law two bills on Thursday. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 affects the collection, sharing and selling of consumer data, while Assembly Bill 1838 prohibits local governments from adding new taxes on sodas until 2031. November ballot initiatives related to each law were withdrawn. 

A ballot initiative is a bill or constitutional amendment proposed by a citizen of the state that can become law if approved by voters. Ballot initiatives don’t require involvement from the governor or legislature.
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
The Act gives California consumers the right to know what personal data is being collected, why it is being collected and with whom it is shared. Consumers will have the option to prohibit companies, such as Google or Facebook, from selling their information to third parties and the law will affect any business that collects data on their customers. It would not affect companies “sharing” data without cost. 
Minors under the age of 16 would be required to opt-in for any data collection under the Act. The legislation is scheduled to come into effect in 2020 and could be amended before then. 
The bill was introduced by state Assembly member Ed Chau and state Sen. Robert Hertzberg on June 21 and was unanimously approved in the Assembly and Senate on Thursday.
After the law was passed, Alastair Mactaggart, a real estate developer who had put forward a ballot initiative regarding data privacy rules, said he would withdraw his measure. A bill can be amended by lawmakers, where ballot initiatives, if approved, can typically only be changed by another ballot initiative, CNN reported.
Assembly Bill 1838
Assembly Bill 1838 prohibits local governments from imposing new taxes on soda beverages until Jan. 1, 2031. California cities that have already implemented soda taxes, which include Berkeley, San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, can continue to tax the beverages.  
The bill was introduced by the Committee on Budget on June 24. It passed the Senate 27-1, with only Democratic senators voting in favor, and some Republican senators abstaining. It passed the Assembly 60-1. 
In accordance with an agreement between legislators and business representatives, the nonalcoholic beverage industry withdrew a ballot initiative to raise the voter threshold to approve local sales tax increases on any items. The initiative called for a two-thirds supermajority vote of local citizens to approve sales tax measures, an increase from the current 50 percent simple majority for most local taxes. The deadline to withdraw ballot initiatives was Thursday.

37978,2018-06-30,"16 rescued, 100 dead after smuggling vessel capsizes in Mediterranean","On Friday, 16 migrants were rescued and at least 100 died after the vessel carrying them capsized in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The migrants had been en route to Europe aboard an inflatable craft operated by smugglers when an explosion occurred on board and the vessel capsized, according to survivors interviewed by AFP. The Libyan coast guard brought the survivors and the bodies of three children recovered from the site back to Libya. 
Also on Friday, in a separate rescue operation, the IOM said the Libyan coast guard brought 345 migrants ashore at the Libyan capital city of Tripoli. More than 10,000 migrants have been transported back to Libya so far in 2018, according to the IOM, with the country’s coast guard returning more than 2,000 last week.
Karline Kleijer, head of emergencies for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday that there is “extreme violence and abuses that refugees and migrants suffer in Libya.""
EU leaders announced an agreement on migration on Friday, after meeting at the European Council summit in Brussels. The deal proposes the creation of ""regional disembarkation platforms"" in North African nations, as well as “control centers” in Europe, to process migrants and receive refugees’ claims for asylum. The proposal seeks to reduce the number of migrants who attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea in smugglers’ vessels. North African nations have not said whether they are able or interested in participating in such a system.
The EU leaders also agreed to provide more money for Spain and Morocco, to be used to lessen the number of migrants coming into Europe.
Illegal migrant crossings into Europe have decreased 95 percent since their peak in October 2015, according to the European Council. As of June 6, approximately 33,400 migrants have reached Europe via the sea since the beginning of the year, according to the IOM, and an estimated 785 have died.

38106,2018-07-01,Trump to announce Supreme Court nominee July 9 from 'about five' candidates,"On Friday, President Donald Trump said he was considering a list of “about five” people for a Supreme Court nominee that he would announce on July 9. Trump said he is considering two women and would “probably” interview about six or seven candidates altogether for the seat being vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement on Wednesday, effective July 31. Trump said he would pick a nominee from the list of 25 names he released last November. 
“We have great people,” Trump said of the list, adding that they were “highly talented, very brilliant, mostly conservative judges.” On Wednesday, Trump said he was “honored” to be able to select the next Supreme Court nominee, adding that, “We have to pick one that’s going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.”
The Washington Post reported that an anonymous Trump adviser said the president was considering three attributes for the nominee: 1) “extraordinarily well qualified,” 2) “not weak,” meaning someone with independent judgement such as from the “political and social fashions of the day,” and 3) someone who will “interpret the Constitution the way the framers meant it to be.”
“Outside of war and peace, of course, the most important decision you make is the selection of a Supreme Court judge,” Trump said Friday.
When asked about whether his nominee would support the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman’s right to have an abortion, Trump said, “I’m not going to ask them that question.”
On Sunday, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said, “I would not support a nominee who demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade because that would mean to me that their judicial philosophy did not include a respect for established decisions, established law.”
Some of Kennedy’s votes on abortion, gay rights, the death penalty and affirmative action have sided with a majority of the Democrat-appointed justices in cases decided by two votes or less. 
The candidates
The top candidates the president may be considering, according to the Post, include:

	Thomas M. Hardiman, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge
	Amy Coney Barrett, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge 
	Brett M. Kavanaugh, U.S. Circuit Judge 
	Raymond Kethledge, U.S. Circuit Judge 
	Amul Thapar, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge 

The New York Times listed U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Joan L. Larsen in place of Kethledge on its “front-runners” list, and also included U.S. Court of Appeals Judge William H. Pryor Jr. on the list.
There is one current Senator on the list of 25 potential candidates: Mike Lee (R-Utah). The remaining candidates were all judges at the time the White House released the list.
Republican leaders plan to have Trump’s nominee speak to senators in person through early August, with confirmation hearings beginning in late August, committee votes by early September, and a vote in the full Senate later that month so a new justice can be sworn in before the start of the next court term on Oct. 1, the Post reported. 
Democratic leaders said the Senate should wait until newly-elected Senators are sworn in after the November midterm elections before voting on a nominee. In 2016, the Senate delayed voting on then-President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, until Trump was elected, and then confirmed Trump’s nominee, Neil Gorsuch, for the vacant seat in April 2017.
Background on the Supreme Court
Approximately 7,000 to 8,000 new cases are filed each term in the Supreme Court, according to its website. For a case to be considered before the court, four judges must select it to be heard.
Court sessions “usually” continue until late June or early July, according to the court’s website. During the summer, justices analyze new petitions for cases to review, consider motions and applications, and prepare for cases to be argued in the fall.
Current makeup of the court
Justices appointed by Republican presidents
John G. Roberts, Jr., 63, Chief Justice, was nominated by then-President George W. Bush and took his seat on Sept. 29, 2005.

38216,2018-07-02,Rescuers find entire missing Thai boys’ soccer team alive in flooded cave,"On Monday, rescuers found a boys’ soccer team that went missing June 23 while on a day trip to a cave in Thailand, after they became trapped by flooding. The 12 boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach, were found by naval special forces and reported “safe,” according to provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn. 

The team members were trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, in the Chiang Rai province. They are still underground where they took shelter from flooding on a ledge above water in a cavern, according to BBC. In order to evacuate them, rescue divers will need to bring them out through the water. 
Narongsak said medics would examine the boys and evaluate the situation as well as their strength and health in order to bring them out of the cave later.
“Our mission is to search, rescue and return,” Narongsak said. “So far we just found them. Next mission is to bring them out from the cave and send them home.”
Rescue teams are also working to pump water out of the cave and divert groundwater, AP reported. More than 1,000 people have been involved in the rescue operation, according to BBC, including groups from Australia, China, Myanmar, Laos, the U.S. and the U.K. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha thanked the international groups for their “tremendous efforts” in helping with the operation.
The coach had taken his team to the same cave two years ago, BBC reported.

38194,2018-07-02,FBI arrests Cleveland man for allegedly planning July 4th attack,"The FBI arrested a 48-year-old suspect on Sunday, alleging he was planning an attack at a July 4th parade in Cleveland, Ohio, authorities reported Monday. The suspect was charged with attempted material support of a foreign terrorist organization, and is scheduled to appear in federal court later on Monday. FBI special agent Steve Anthony said at a news conference on Monday that the suspect made continual “statements of violent intentions” and “expressed willingness to conduct a US based attack” on behalf of al-Qaida.
The suspect is Demetrius N. Pitts, a U.S. citizen who also sometimes used the names Abdur Raheem Rahfeeq and Salahadeen Osama Waleed. The suspect had been communicating with a undercover FBI agent posing as an al-Qaida operative. Their interactions were recorded. 
Pitts told the undercoverage agent that he was “trying to figure out something that would shake them up on the 4th of July,” later saying they should “have a bomb to blow up at the 4th of July parade,” according to the FBI affidavit. 
Pitts had told the undercover agent he did not want to denote bombs himself, and considered himself more of a planner and scout, according to the affidavit. The FBI alleged Pitts at one point suggested giving remote control cars with C-4 explosives to the children of military personnel in the parade, “so that the children would unwittingly detonate the bombs,” or planting it under police vehicles, the affidavit said. The criminal complaint alleged the suspect scouted locations to park a van filled with explosives. 
The suspect has a previous criminal record, including charges or domestic violence, assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Authorities began watching Pitts as early as 2015 after he sent a message to a political commentary radio show saying the U.S. would be “destroyed.” In 2017, the suspect reportedly posted on social media support of al-Qaida. If convicted of the terrorism-related charge, Pitts could be imprisoned for up to 20 years, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.
The Washington Post said it was unable to immediately locate a defense attorney for Pitts on Monday.
Justin Herdman, U.S. Attorney for the northern district of Ohio, said of the July 4th parade planned in Cleveland, “our police, our sheriff’s department and our Justice Department employees will remain vigilant in protecting our community.” Everyone should “continue to gather, continue to celebrate America, continue to celebrate our men and women in law enforcement … [and] to engage in the exchange of ideas that is central to our democracy,” he said.

38161,2018-07-02,López Obrador claims victory in Mexican presidential election,"Andrés Manuel López Obrador claimed victory in Mexico’s presidential election on Sunday, after the other candidates conceded the election. The president elect, commonly known by the acronym of his initials “AMLO,” addressed supporters in Mexico City on Sunday night. “Today, they have recognized our victory,” he said. 
Ricardo Anaya, of the PAN party, José Antonio Meade, who ran as the ruling PRI party candidate, and Jaime Rodríguez Calderón conceded after polls closed at 9 p.m. EDT. Exit polls had shown López Obrador as winning 53 to 59 percent of the vote. Incumbent President Enrique Peña Nieto also called to congratulate López Obrador on Sunday night and said he would work towards a smooth transition.

López Obrador’s founded the National Regeneration Movement (Morena) party in 2014, after leaving another party. He is scheduled to be sworn into office for on Dec. 1. Mexican presidents are constitutionally limited to a single six-year term. Presidents are elected by popular vote and there is no run-off system, according to the NEI. 
The PRI governed Mexico for the 71 years between 1929 and 2000, and then PRI candidate Peña Nieto won the presidency in 2012.
Economic and security proposals

López Obrador has proposed reviewing existing contracts under which some of the oil sector was privatized during Peña Nieto’s tenure. Prior to the election, he said he would reduce the presidential salary by one-half and continue living in his own house if elected president. “I’m going to govern by example, with austerity,” he said.
He also said he would reduce poverty and unemployment, and eliminate Mexico’s secret service and intelligence agency. “The policies we’ve been applying for the past 30 years haven’t worked,” López Obrador said at a rally on Wednesday, the last official day of campaigning before the election. “That’s why we’re going to send their policies to the dustbin of history.”
López Obrador has said he would implement agricultural subsidies, higher pensions, and monetary grants or apprenticeships for young people who are not working or in school, according to Shannon O’Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations.
On Sunday night in his victory speech, López Obrador said, “More than through the use of force, we will tend to the causes that give rise to insecurity and violence,” noting that he begin to “develop a “plan for reconciliation and peace” with the input of rights groups, religious leaders and the United Nations. He hasn’t committed to any specific plans for the goal.
Last December, López Obrador had mentioned the possibility of offering amnesty deals for criminals, such as cartel members, as part of peace negotiations. Olga Sánchez Cordero, the woman López Obrador has proposed as an interior minister, said that any amnesty proposals would be put to a public referendum and sent to Congress only with public support. Sánchez Cordero also said longer-term goals include decriminalizing marijuana for recreational use or growing opium for medicinal purposes. 
Relations with the US
López Obrador said, “we are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States.” The president-elect thanked President Donald Trump for his congratulations via Twitter on Sunday night. Trump had said he “very much” looked forward to working with López Obrador.
“We are never going to disrespect the U.S. government, because we want them to respect us,” Lopez Obrador said in an interview on Monday morning. “At the appropriate moment, we are going to get in touch, to reach an understanding” with the Trump administration. López Obrador also said he supports renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and the U.S., noting he would not interfere in negotiations until he takes office. 
Issues in Mexico

A 2017 Pew Research Center survey of 1,000 Mexicans found that 13 percent were satisfied and 85 percent dissatisfied with the way things were going in their country. The top eight “very big problems” identified by survey participants were crime, corrupt political leaders, drug cartel-related violence, rising prices, corrupt police officers, lack of employment opportunities, poor-quality schools, and the gap between wealthy and poor people.

There were a record 25,000 murders in Mexico last year, according to AFP. Etellekt, a Mexican political analysis consulting company, reported 113 candidates, current and former politicians and people attempting to run for office have been killed since September, including 48 of candidates for local office. Three hundred candidates, current and former politicians have experienced physical aggression during that time, according to Etellekt. 

According to the Mexican government, 43.6 percent of the country’s population was poor in 2016 (equivalent to 53.4 million out of a total 122 million), while 7.6 percent was in extreme poverty, meaning they could not afford basic items. In 2014, the government defined the poverty line as living on no more than $2,542 pesos ($157.70) per month in cities, and $1,615 pesos (about $100) in rural areas, with incomes for “extreme poverty” amounting to about half those numbers. In its poverty calculations, the government also considers other factors such as healthcare and education, Reuters reported.

In the first quarter of 2018, the Mexican unemployment rate was 3.2 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). OECD notes that “unemployed people are those who report that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks.” Individuals who have stopped looking for work are not included in the unemployment numbers.

38152,2018-07-02,"US has 1-year plan to dismantle North Korean nuclear, other WMD programs, Bolton says","On Sunday, National Security Advisor John Bolton said the U.S. had developed a program to dismantle all of North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs within a year. He said he was “sure” that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be discussing the program with North Korea in the “near future.” Bolton said the year-long program would require “full disclosure” of all chemical, biological and nuclear programs, as well as ballistic missile sites in the country. 
“If they have the strategic decision already made to do that, and they’re cooperative, we can move very quickly,” Bolton said. “And it is to North Korea's advantage to dismantle very quickly. Then the elimination of sanctions, aid by South Korea and Japan and others can all begin to flow,” he added.
“Physically, we would be able to dismantle the overwhelming bulk of [North Korea’s] programs within a year,"" Bolton said. 
Stanford University academics have proposed a 10-year roadmap for the complete denuclearization of North Korea. Some say it could take less than 10 years.
On Sunday, South Korean media reported that U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim met with North Korean officials that day to discuss plans for Pompeo’s next visit to the North. 
Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said U.S. and South Korean officials indicated Sung Kim was preparing a trip by Pompeo to Pyongyang at the end of this week. The State Department has not confirmed such travel plans. Pompeo recently spoke about North Korea with the foreign ministers of China, Japan and South Korea, according to the State Department.
Washington Post and NBC News report on North Korean weapons activities
The Washington Post reported on Saturday that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that North Korea has secret weapons facilities, that the latest evidence suggests it does not intend to give up all its nuclear weapons and that it may hide the number of weapons it has.
NBC News reported that a U.S. official briefed on the latest North Korean intelligence said, “There's no evidence that [North Koreans] are decreasing stockpiles, or that they have stopped their production” of weapons. The official added, ""There is absolutely unequivocal evidence that they are trying to deceive the U.S.""
U.S. intelligence does not know the exact number of nuclear weapons North Korea has, according to Reuters. The Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that North Korea has about 50, and all intelligence agencies have concluded the country is concealing weapons.
When asked about “new reports this weekend” on “Fox News Sunday,” Bolton said, ""I am not going to comment on any reports, true, untrue, or partially true, about intelligence.” Bolton added, “I will just say this: Not answering the specific reports we've seen over the weekend ... we are using the full range of our capabilities to understand what North Korea is doing.""
On CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Bolton said, “We know exactly what the risks are — [North Korea] using negotiations to drag out the length of time they have to continue their nuclear, chemical, biological weapons programs and ballistic missiles.”
President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 to discuss denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and other issues. After the meeting, the two leaders released a statement saying Trump “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea, and Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
On Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” Trump said of Kim, “I made a deal with him. I shook hands with him. I really believe he means it.”
Bolton said, ""There's nobody involved in this discussion with North Korea in the administration who is overburdened by naïveté. We've seen how the North Koreans have behaved before. The President's been very clear. He is not going to make the mistakes of prior administrations. We are going to pursue this, and we will see what happens.""
Bolton also said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that “we’re going to try and proceed to implement what the two leaders agreed to in Singapore.” He said, “Kim Jong Un was very emphatic several times in Singapore; he was different from prior regimes.” He added, ""Now, we'll let their actions speak for themselves.”

38149,2018-07-02,Tens of thousands demonstrate for immigrant families to be reunited,"On Saturday, tens of thousands of people participated in demonstrations organized by “Families Belong Together” to call for undocumented immigrant children to be immediately reunited with their families. In Washington, D.C., an estimated 30,000 demonstrators gathered in Lafayette Park near the White House, according to The Associated Press. There were more than 700 events around the country, including thousands who marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, and thousands who marched in Chicago.
On its webpage, Families Belong Together had a link to a petition that read, “We demand that the Trump administration stop caging children and jailing their families IMMEDIATELY -- and reunite children in immigration custody with their families at once!”
Families Belong Together was formed and supported by multiple organizations, including The Leadership Conference, National Domestic Workers Alliance, MoveOn and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
As part of Saturday’s demonstrations, people protested on the bridge connecting El Paso, Texas with Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and others gathered in protest outside a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas.
During the demonstrations, police arrested five people for blocking a road outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in Dallas, and at least one person was arrested in Columbus, Ohio, when protesters blocked a downtown street, AP reported. 
Family detention policy developments
The demonstrators were protesting the more than 2,000 children separated from their undocumented immigrant parents as part of the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” since April. Last Tuesday, a federal judge in San Diego ordered the federal government to reunite separated children with their families within 14 days of the court’s injunction for children under five years old, and within 30 days for older children. 
The Department of Health and Human Services said it was reviewing its entire caseload of about 12,000 immigrant children under government care to ensure compliance with the ruling. Some of these children may have been separated from parents before the “zero-tolerance policy” was announced in April, and others may have been found unaccompanied.
In a June 20 executive order, President Donald Trump called for the attorney general to file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the “Flores settlement” so the government could detain alien families together during proceedings, such as criminal ones for illegal entry into the country.
The 1997 “Flores settlement” is a “consent decree” court agreement that resulted from a constitutional challenge of U.S. practices and regulations regarding the detention of unaccompanied immigrant children. Courts and the government have in the past interpreted the Flores settlement to limit detainment of both unaccompanied and accompanied children to 20 days.
On Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed documents in a Los Angeles court regarding the Flores settlement, in which the DOJ argued that families could now be detained together since the San Diego injunction barred them from being separated, unless adults were deemed “unfit” as parents or a danger to their children. 
Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said the government did not have to detain families, and could release parents who do not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. He also said undocumented migrant parents can choose to release their children if they do not want them to be held in a family detention center.

38315,2018-07-03,Trump says ICE needed to deport gang members,"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is needed to deport MS-13 gang members. His comments came after some Democratic lawmakers called for the agency to be dismantled.
“When we have an ‘infestation’ of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE!” the president tweeted. “They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments (sic) that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.” Midterm elections will be on Nov. 6. 
In following tweet, Trump said, “How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!”
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), as well as congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have called for the abolishment of ICE. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has suggested “starting from scratch” regarding ICE, which was created in 2003 under the George W. Bush administration.
The official White House Twitter account directed messages to both Warren and Harris about their stance on ICE, suggesting the lawmakers were not aware of “what ICE really does.” The account tweeted examples of ICE removing alleged MS-13 gang members or people alleged to be affiliated with the gang.
Harris later responded, “As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.”
ICE facilitated the separation of immigrant children and families at the border as part of the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy of prosecuting all illegal border crossers. Trump signed an executive order last month to end family separations. The order did not provide a plan for family reunification.
Last week, a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite children with undocumented parents from whom they have been separated under the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy.” The injunction ordered that children under five years old must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, and older children must be reunited within 30 days.

38312,2018-07-03,California court rules Yelp can’t be forced to remove negative posts,"California Supreme Court ruled Monday that online review site Yelp.com cannot be ordered by a judge to remove posts against a San Francisco law firm. The court ruled that federal law protected digital platforms like Yelp from liability for statements written by others, and that removing a post would be up to the company’s discretion. The 4-3 decision by the justices overturned a lower court ruling.
Forcing a site to remove user-generated posts “can impose substantial burdens” on the online company, Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye wrote in the majority opinion. “Even if it would be mechanically simple to implement such an order, compliance still could interfere with and undermine the viability of an online platform.”
While the plaintiff’s lawyer, Monique Olivier, argued that the state Supreme Court’s ruling “stands as an invitation to spread falsehoods on the internet without consequence,” Yelp argued that the court order would have given businesses the ability to seek legal action for unwanted or negative reviews.
Aaron Schur, a deputy general counsel for Yelp, said Monday’s decision lets online publishers in California know that they “cannot be lawfully forced to remove third-party speech through enterprising abuses of the legal system.” Schur also said Yelp had determined that the reviews about Hassell’s law firm were not libelous.
Olivier said her client was considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Background
In a 2013 lawsuit, attorney Dawn Hassell accused a client she had represented in a personal injury case of defamation after the client posted a Yelp review claiming the attorney’s firm didn’t adequately communicate with the client. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Donald Sullivan ruled in favor of Hassell and ordered the client and Yelp to remove the review. When the client and Yelp didn’t remove the post, Hassell received a court order from a second judge telling Yelp to remove it. The order was also upheld by a state appeals court.
Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft sent a letter to the California Supreme Court that said the lower court ruling “radically departs from a large, unanimous and settled body of federal and state court precedent” and could be used to “silence a vast quantity of protected and important speech.”
Yelp then began working with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which filed an amicus brief in the Yelp case in 2016. Amicus briefs are filed with a court by non-litigants with an interest in a given case, to provide the court with additional information or arguments it might deem relevant. 
The ACLU argued that the removal order “requires Yelp to remove speech from its website without giving it any opportunity to argue that the speech in question is constitutionally protected.”

38287,2018-07-03,UK issues new LGBT Action Plan,"The U.K.’s Government Equalities Office on Tuesday issued a 32-page “action plan” to address issues that affect the nation’s “LGBT community.” The plan was drafted in response to the results of a U.K.-wide survey of LGBTQ people, which received at least 108,000 replies. The plan would receive an initial $5.95 million (£4.5m) in funding from the Government Equalities Office, for spending until the review period in March 2020.
As part of the action plan, the government would appoint a national “LGBT health advisor” to reduce “the health inequalities that LGBT people face,” as well as take steps to stop the practice of “conversion therapy,” which the plan describes as an attempt to “cure” LGBTQ people of their sexual orientation. The plan said the Government Equalities Office “will fully consider all legislative and non-legislative options to prohibit promoting, offering or conducting conversion therapy.” The plan noted that it doesn’t intend to prohibit LGBTQ people from seeking “legitimate” medical or spiritual support.
Additional actions outlined in the plan include extending “anti-homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying program in schools,” and “improving the recording and reporting of, and police response to, [LGBTQ] hate crime.”
The online survey, which ran from July to October of last year, polled LGBTQ people about their experiences in the U.K. The survey found that 6 percent of respondents had been threatened with physical or sexual harassment or violence, 2 percent had experienced physical violence and 2 percent had experienced sexual violence within a year of the survey. 
Two percent of survey respondents had undergone “conversion therapy,” while 5 percent said they had been offered it. According to The Guardian, all U.K. regulatory bodies associated with counselling and psychotherapy, and the National Health Service, have banned members from using “conversion therapy.”
The survey also found that 68 percent of respondents had avoided holding hands in public with a same-sex partner, and 70 percent said they had “at times not been open about their sexual orientation.”
“I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction,” U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said in response to the plan. “No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love. [The plan will] set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society.”
The U.K. said it aims to “deliver the commitments in this action plan” by the end of
the current Parliament, which ends March 2020.

38282,2018-07-03,German Chancellor’s party alliance reaches deal on illegal migration,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, two leaders of the government’s grand coalition, agreed to a new migration policy on Monday. According to German news outlet Deutsche Welle (DW), the plan still needs to be approved by the grand coalition’s third party, the Social Democrats (SPD), and the government of Austria before it can be implemented.
Germany’s governing grand coalition includes three political parties: Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Seehofer’s Christian Social Union (CSU) and the SPD, which is led by Andrea Nahles.
After multiple days of negotiation, Merkel said they had “reached a good compromise.” Seehofer said the agreement was “sustainable” and matched his “convictions,” and had allowed him to remain head of the Interior Ministry.
The tentative plan includes:

	“Rejecting” asylum seekers at the German-Austrian border if they are registered in another EU country
	Creating “transit centers” at the border to expedite deportations
	A bilateral deal with Austria that has yet to be drafted on how to handle EU countries that refuse to take back asylum seekers; the announcement didn’t include specifics

SPD party leader Andrea Nahles said there was “still a lot that needs to be discussed.” SPD members have spoken against “transit centers,” which SPD migrant expert Aziz Bozkurt described as migrant “camps.”
Peter Beyer, a member of parliament and the CDU’s official commissioner for transatlantic relations, told CNBC he felt the SPD would agree to the deal, “but of course now it needs a lot of negotiation with our neighboring countries, with our partners within the European Union and then what has been negotiated will then have to be implemented.”
According to DW, Austria said it was prepared to take unspecified measures to “protect” the country’s southern borders with Italy and Slovenia. “Should this agreement become the German government's position, we see that as prompting us to take action to prevent negative consequences for Austria and its population,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a joint statement with his vice chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, and interior minister, Herbert Kickl.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said of the deal: “I have not studied it in detail but at first glance — and I have asked the legal services to look at it — it seems to me to be legally compliant.”

38228,2018-07-03,Police in Ohio respond to call about children mowing wrong lawn,"Ohio resident Lucille Holt-Colden posted a video online via Facebook Live Stream last week showing police responding to a call about children mowing the wrong lawn. Holt-Colden had hired 12-year-old Reginald (Reggie) Fields, who runs “Mr. Reggie’s Lawn Cutting Service,” to mow her yard in Maple Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.

Reggie said later he didn’t realize his team, made up of himself, his sister and two cousins, was partly mowing neighbor Linda Krakora’s lawn. The police did not stop or give any citations to the children. 
Krakora said she and her husband called the police about Holt-Colden, not the children, “because we can’t talk to her [Holt-Colden].” Both Krakora and Holt-Colden spoke critically about having the other as a neighbor. According to Holt-Colden, Krakora has phoned the police about incidents she or her family had done at least five times since she moved in last October.
When Maple Heights police arrived at the house, they spoke to the adults only and no action was taken against the children, Lt. Joe Mocsiran said. Mocsiran also said that in the neighborhood where the incident took place, it was difficult to tell where the beginning and end of each person’s lawn was. 
Holt-Colden, Reggie and his lawn mowing team are black, and Krakora is white. Holt-Colden alleged that Krakora would not have called the police if the children were white. Krakora, who has lived in her house for more than 30 years, said, “I don’t have an issue with color or I would have moved years ago.” Holt-Colden said there are people from a variety of races who live in the neighborhood.
Holt-Colden posted her video online with the caption “This is RIDICULOUS!!!” As of Monday afternoon, the video had more than 500,000 views. Holt-Colden also started a GoFundMe page for Reggie and by Saturday afternoon, the campaign had raised more than $41,000. Others have donated landscaping equipment to Reggie. 
Reggie’s mother said his customers have increased after the incident. Reggie, who will be starting seventh grade, plans to buy rakes and shovels to continue his business in the fall and winter, CNN reported.

38223,2018-07-03,5 men lynched in India after false social media messages about child abductors,"On Sunday, in India's Maharashtra state, five men passing through a village were lynched by locals after rumors were shared over the WhatsApp messaging app that child abductors might be in the area, according to police. CNN reported the men were surrounded by a crowd of almost 3,000 people and attacked by 40 in the Dhule district. Police arrived in the area after the men were killed and two of the police officers were also injured by locals, according to the Dhule Superintendent of Police.
According to police, 23 people have been arrested and charged with murder and rioting during the incident, and authorities are searching for the remaining attackers. Police said they have imposed a curfew on the village as well as suspended internet and mobile services in Dhule district. 
The five men killed were identified as Bharat Bhosale, Dadarao Bhosale, Raju Bhosale, Aganu Hingole and Bharat Mawale, according to BBC. Police said they belonged to a nomadic community and had been begging as they passed through the village. 
Other lynchings in India
Last week, three people were killed in the northeastern state of Tripura after social media and WhatsApp messages warned about child abduction. Smriti Ranjan Das, a police official, said people were alleging on social media that child abductors looking for human organs such as kidneys and livers were in the area to kidnap children. One of the men who was killed in that incident had been hired by the Tripura administration to make public announcements through a loudspeaker about false rumors. 
In June, a crowd lynched two men in northeastern Assam after they had stopped their car to ask for directions. Messages on social media said the men were holding a child in their car. 
In May, a group of locals killed a transgender woman and injured three other women in the city of Hyderabad, after messages on WhatsApp said transgender women were kidnapping children.
Also in May, people lynched a 55-year-old woman in Tamil Nadu state after she gave sweets to children. Police arrested 30 people in connection with the incident.
Authorities respond
In Dhule district, police have run ads in local newspapers and on TV to inform people about false messages.
In Assam, police are monitoring social media sites.
In June, police and residents in Hyderabad participated in a march with loudspeakers, saying, “don't believe the rumors.”
In Tamil, authorities have run “awareness drives,” to inform the public about false messages, according to BBC. 
Police in the southern state of Telangana have issued warnings and arrested people who propagated false video messages online.
According to Statista, more than 200 million Indians used Whatsapp in 2017, of India’s population of more than 1.3 billion.

38396,2018-07-04,Polish supreme court judge reports to work after new retirement law takes effect,"Polish Supreme Court judge Małgorzata Gersdorf, who is 65, reported to work on Wednesday, after legislation went into effect Tuesday at midnight that forces judges over 64 years old to retire unless they request permission to continue from the president. Gersdorf said under Poland’s constitution, she should be allowed to remain in her current role until 2020. 
“My presence here is not about politics,” Gersdorf, who has been Supreme Court president since 2014, said. “I am here to protect the rule of law.” Gersdorf spoke to hundreds of people gathered outside the Supreme Court building on Wednesday. They chanted “constitution” and sang the Polish national anthem.
Gersdorf has said the government’s new law is “a purge of the Supreme Court conducted under the guise of retirement reform.” Poland said its judicial reforms are to counter corruption and replace judges who were present when Poland was a communist country until 1989, BBC reported. 
Gersdorf was one of 11 of the 27 Supreme Court judges of at least 65 years of age who did not request presidential assent to stay in her role, according to BBC. There are 73 Polish Supreme Court judges in total. Gersdorf met with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday, BBC reported. A presidential aide later said Duda would appoint a replacement for Gersdorf.
Judicial reforms
Poland began a series of judicial reforms in 2015 after the PiS party came to power, including a requirement that the constitutional tribunal and prosecutors report directly to the justice minister, a cabinet position, Reuters reported. 
The EU said that 13 new laws in Poland in two years have allowed the government to ""interfere significantly"" in the judiciary. 
The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, began a disciplinary procedure last year over Poland’s reforms that could result in the country losing its voting rights in the Commission, according to Reuters. All 28 EU countries would have to approve of the voting loss for it to pass, and Hungary has said it would oppose such a move. 
The Commission also opened a legal case against Poland on Monday, saying the new law affecting forced retirements from the Supreme Court undermines judicial independence. The EU has said that under the new law, judges cannot seek a review of their request to stay on if it is denied by the president, and that no explanation of the denial is required. The Commission gave Poland one month to respond to its challenge of the new Polish law; the “standard” timeframe is two months, BBC reported. 
The Polish government says that EU treaties do not provide the European Commission with authority over national matters such as the judiciary. “Let me mention a fundamental issue,” said Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of Poland’s PiS ruling party. “The court system ... is an entirely internal matter.”
On Wednesday, Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, “Each EU state has the right to shape their legal system according to their own traditions.”
""For the time being our stance is that we are right,” said Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz.

38393,2018-07-04,"Malaysian ex-Prime Minister Najib pleads not guilty to corruption charges, is freed on bail","On Wednesday, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was released on $250,000 bail after pleading not guilty to three counts of criminal breach of trust and one of abuse of power. Najib, who was arrested Tuesday in Kuala Lumpur, is accused of illegally having about $700 million from the state-owned development fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) transferred to his accounts. He has denied the corruption charges and was cleared of wrongdoing while he was prime minister. 
Najib’s party did not secure a majority in the May election this year, and 93-year-old Mahathir Mohamad took over as prime minister. Mahathir had said he would reopen the investigation into Najib, who had been prime minister since 2009. The investigation was reopened after the election.
Najib set up 1MDB in 2009 with the stated goal of improving the country’s economy through investments. The fund missed payments in 2015 on some of its $11 billion in debt to banks and bondholders. After that, a report in The Wall Street Journal alleged there was evidence the $700 million had been transfered to Najib’s personal accounts. 
Najib and 1MDB have been investigated by other countries, including the U.S., which is seeking to recover about $540 million it alleges was misappropriated from the 1MDB fund. The U.S. Justice Department filed a complaint that alleged that officials at 1MDB, their relatives and other associates diverted more than $4.5 billion in 1MDB funds, some through U.S. financial institutions. 
“These cases involve billions of dollars that should have been used to help the people of Malaysia, but instead was used by a small number of individuals to fuel their astonishing greed,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Brown. “We simply will not allow the United States to be a place where corrupt individuals can expect to hide assets and lavishly spend money that should be used for the benefit of citizens of other nations.”
Police said last week they had seized at least $225 million worth of jewelry, cash and goods from six properties associated with Najib. Najib and his wife said the seized items were legally acquired, BBC reported.
On his way out of the courthouse, Najib said he thought the trial was politically motivated. He also said the trial was “my best opportunity to clear my name.” A spokesman for the former prime minister said his arrest was “the result of political vengeance” by Malaysian leadership. The spokesman also said Najib “will contest these charges and clear his name in court.”
Each count Najib has been charged with carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Aug. 8.

38433,2018-07-05,British police find same nerve agent that poisoned Skripals caused British couple’s illness,"U.K. police announced on Wednesday that a British couple who became critically ill had been exposed to Novichok, the same military-grade nerve agent that international authorities concluded was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter on March 4. Police do not know how the two came to be exposed to the nerve agent.
The couple, identified as Dawn Sturgess, 44, from Salisbury, and Charlie Rowley, 45, from Amesbury, fell ill in their Amesbury home on Saturday, about 8 miles (12 km) from Sergei Skripal’s home in Salisbury. Paramedics arrived at the Amesbury home at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday to treat Sturgess, and again about five hours later to treat Rowley. The two were taken to the same hospital where the Skripals had been treated.
Neil Basu, a British counter-terrorism officer, said that scientists at the Porton Down laboratory had determined that Novichok had caused the symptoms of Sturgess and Rowley. 
“We are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to,” Basu said. “The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of inquiry for us. It is important, however, that the investigation is led by the evidence available and the facts alone and we don’t make any assumptions.”
Basu noted that “people in the area can expect to see an increased police presence, which will include officers wearing protective equipment.” On Wednesday, police cordoned off multiple places where the couple had been before they got sick, including the Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury, within walking distance of where the Skripals fell ill. 
After the Skripal attack, health officials decontaminated multiple areas, and said that there might still be “hot spots” where Novichok could still be present, according to The New York Times. Ian Boyd, a chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said in April that “the chemical does not degrade quickly.” He added at that time, “You can assume it is not much different now from the day it was distributed.”
The group of Novichok chemicals (Russian for “newcomer”) were produced in the 1970s and 1980s by Soviet Union laboratories. The agents block the breakdown of a neurotransmitter that controls muscular contractions, which leads to respiratory and cardiac arrest, according to Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who helped develop the chemicals and who spoke to investigators following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
British investigators found the highest concentration of Novichok that poisoned the Skripals on Sergei’s front door. British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for that attack. The U.K., and more than 20 other countries, expelled a total of 150 Russian diplomats in support of the U.K. determination. Russia has denied responsibility for the attack. The country responded to the expulsions by saying it would expel a total of 150 diplomats from those countries.
Sergei and his daughter Yulia were later released from the hospital after they had sufficiently recovered from some of the effects of their poisoning.

38418,2018-07-05,Senate committee says intelligence assessment of alleged Russian election interference was ‘sound’,"The Senate Intelligence Committee released a summary of some of its findings on the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The seven-page summary released on Tuesday by Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said the committee concluded the ICA was a “sound intelligence product.” The summary noted that the ICA did not address the topic of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The ICA was published by the Director of National Intelligence and assessed “Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections.” Among other conclusions, the document said that the National Security Agency (NSA), FBI and CIA assessed with “high confidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an “influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.”
The summary released by Burr said, “The Committee has spent the last 16 months reviewing the sources, tradecraft and analytic work underpinning the Intelligence Community Assessment and sees no reason to dispute the conclusions.” 
The summary also said that after the committee’s “comprehensive” report was complete, a declassified version of it would be released to the public. The committee announced its initial conclusions in May and made recommendations at the time to address “vulnerabilities” in U.S. election processes for example, irregularities with voting machines.
Regarding possible “political pressure” on intelligence agency assessments, the summary said, ""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions. All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""
The summary mentioned the difference in confidence levels between the NSA, which assessed with “moderate confidence,” and the CIA and FBI, which assessed with “high confidence,” that “Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.” The committee said it found ""the analytical disagreement was reasonable, transparent, and openly debated among the agencies.” 
The summary also addressed whether the “Steele dossier,” a document prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele that made unverified allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election in coordination with Trump’s campaign, may have influenced the intelligence assessments. “All individuals the Committee interviewed verified that the dossier did not in any way inform the analysis in the ICA - including the key findings - because it was unverified information and had not been disseminated as serialized intelligence reporting,” the summary said. 
The Washington Post reported that the committee may later release assessments of the Obama administration’s conduct related to alleged Russian interference efforts, the role of social media in the alleged interference efforts, and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
House Intelligence Committee report
In April, the House Intelligence Committee released a partially redacted version of a final report on its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The report was authored by the Republican majority of the committee. The committee Democrats released a separate, unclassified “Minority Views” report the same day. 
The majority document concluded there were “failings” in intelligence procedures and technique used in the ICA, specifically in judgments regarding “Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategic objectives for disrupting the U.S. election.” The minority report said the minority “found no evidence that calls into question the quality and reliability of the ICA’s underlying reporting and key judgments.”

38509,2018-07-06,US tariffs on $34B of Chinese imports to begin Friday; China to impose retaliatory tariffs (Update),"On Friday at 12:01 a.m. EDT, 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion-worth of Chinese imports into the U.S. are set to go into effect. The tariffs are on 818 different categories of items, including industrial machinery, medical devices and automobile parts. China has said that after the U.S. imposes the tariffs, it would impose tariffs on $34 billion-worth of U.S. imports covering 545 categories of items, which could include meat, seafood and corn.
U.S. tariffs on another $16 billion-worth of Chinese imports, on 284 categories of products, would “undergo further review in a public notice and comment process, including a public hearing” before they are applied, according to a June U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) statement. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said the tariffs on the additional $16 billion-worth of Chinese imports are planned to be put into effect in two weeks.
On Thursday, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said of the impending U.S. tariffs, ""The United States will be opening fire on the whole world and also opening fire on itself.” Gao said China ""will never fire the first shot but will be forced to strike back.” He said the U.S. tariffs would negatively affect foreign companies that export goods from China to the U.S. 
Foreign companies, including U.S.-based ones, accounted for 59 percent ($20 billion) of the $34 billion-worth of goods on which tariffs are to be imposed on Friday, according to Gao. 
With regards to China taking trade actions against U.S. companies operating in its country, Gao said his government would protect the “legitimate interests of all foreign businesses in China.” Chinese President Xi Jinping has met with and informed multinational executives in the past three weeks that China would increase the number of sectors in which foreign businesses can invest, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a government official.
U.S. tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against “unfair” or “discriminatory” trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded that “the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.”
On Thursday, Trump said the U.S. could ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion of Chinese goods, with potential future rounds of tariffs on $200 billion of goods and then on $300 billion of goods. The U.S.’ total imports of goods from China in 2017 was $505.5 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Total U.S. exports of goods to China was $129.9 billion, making the 2017 U.S. deficit in goods trade with China $375.6 billion.
Other forms of trade restrictions besides tariffs include quotas, increased product inspections and quarantines, and increased effort enforcing trade regulations.
Also on Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said “most” Fed officials who participated in its June meeting “noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.”
Update: On Friday, the U.S.’ tariffs on $34 billion-worth of Chinese imports went into effect. In response, China imposed tariffs on $34 billion-worth of U.S. imports.

38493,2018-07-06,"HHS has ‘under 3,000’ separated immigrant children; will use DNA tests for parental verification","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday that HHS had identified “under 3,000” children who had been separated from their immigrant parents after crossing into the country illegally. Azar said the department arrived at the number after a “review and comprehensive audit of multiple data sets,” and that included in the number were “approximately 100” children under the age of five. He said HHS would conduct DNA tests to expedite verification of parent-child relations prior to reuniting them.
The Trump administration announced a “zero-tolerance policy” in April that called for all adults who were found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, children cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so the policy has resulted in children being separated from parents or guardians.
A federal judge in California last week issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite children under 5 years of age with their immigrant parents by July 10, and older children by July 26. 
Azar said the deadlines were “extreme” and that “we will comply even if those deadlines prevent us from conducting a standard or even a truncated vetting process” to verify parent-child relations and the safety of homes to which children are to be taken.
Azar said HHS will be conducting DNA tests on the children using cheek swabs, noting that parent-child relation verification using documents such as birth certificates would take too long to meet the court-ordered deadlines. Cmdr. Jonathan White, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, said DNA test results would only be used to match parents with their children. 
Azar said HHS had previously only reunited children with their parents before they were deported, and now the department will be reuniting families in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers during their asylum proceedings. To expedite reunifications, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is relocating detained parents to holding centers near shelters where their claimed children are, according to The Washington Post.
“We want this to be as compassionate a process as it humanly can be,” Azar said.
Also on Thursday, two members of the House sent a letter to the U.S. attorney general, the DHS secretary and Azar requesting information on every separated immigrant child in U.S. custody. Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government Operations Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) sent the request for information, which was outlined in 11 points that included the age, gender, and location of children and their parents.
Azar said HHS currently has more than 11,800 immigrant minors under its care. More than 80 percent of them are teenagers, the majority male, who were unaccompanied in crossing the border, the Post reported.

38489,2018-07-06,"Nearly 60 wildfires burning in western US; 4,200 sq. miles burned in US so far this year","On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that nearly 60 wildfires are burning in the western U.S., including six each in Utah, Colorado and California, and nine in New Mexico, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). Wildfires have burned 4,200 square miles (10,900 square km) in the U.S. for the first half of this year. That is above the average for the same period during the past 10 years of 3,600 square miles (93,000 square km), according to NIFC.
One wildfire in Colorado, the Spring Fire, has burned about 123 square miles (318 square km) and destroyed 104 homes near Fort Garland, about 205 miles (330 km) southwest of Denver, authorities said. The Spring Fire may have been started by an ember from a fire pit. Lightning started some of the other fires in the state, according to authorities. 
In Utah, authorities evacuated 200 to 300 homes near a fire southeast of Salt Lake City. Wildfires in Utah have burned 47 square miles (122 square km) and destroyed 20 to 30 buildings since Sunday, according to Gov. Gary Herbert.
A 113 square mile (294 square km) fire referred to as the County Fire that started Saturday and is burning northwest of Sacramento has resulted in authorities ordering at least 2,500 people to evacuate, according to Anthony Brown, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
Some municipalities canceled planned Fourth of July fireworks celebrations. In Winters, California, west of Sacramento, officials cited “poor quality and smoke covering the town” in canceling its fireworks display. Parowan City, Utah, canceled its fireworks show “due to extremely dry conditions this year.” In Colorado, 40 percent of municipalities canceled their firework displays, according to ABC News.

38496,2018-07-06,EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigns,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt had resigned. Trump said Pruitt had done an “outstanding job,” and that he would “always be thankful to him for this.” In his resignation letter, Pruitt wrote, “the unrelenting attacks on me personally, [and] my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizeable toll on all of us.” Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler will start as acting EPA Administrator on Monday, Trump said. 
Trump announced the resignation through two tweets, which together read: “I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The Senate confirmed Deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will … on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!”
In April, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) said the EPA needed to “take action” on potential ethics violations by Pruitt. The OGE said it expected the EPA to “review and analyze” Pruitt’s rental agreement with a lobbyist whose husband’s clients were “seeking action by the EPA,” his expenses for “travel, security, and salaries for some employees,” his alleged use of subordinates’ time in his housing search potentially being a “misuse” of his position, and his alleged decision to reassign or demote staff who were “attempting to ensure” that his expenses and other actions were in accordance with laws and regulations.
The EPA’s inspector general and the Government Accountability Office are investigating Pruitt’s actions. In April, Trump tweeted, “Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!”

38486,2018-07-06,"At least 35 Palestinians, 3 Israeli police injured during encampment demolition protests","On Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 35 Palestinians were injured during protests against the planned demolition of structures in the West Bank’s Khan al-Ahmar encampment. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said officials arrested 11 protesters, some for throwing stones at Israeli forces. Some witnesses posted videos online that showed Israeli police punching protesters they were attempting to arrest.
Israeli authorities brought three bulldozers to the site on Wednesday in preparation for the demolition after Israeli forces left a land confiscation notice there on Tuesday, according to Reuters. Israel said the encampment structures were built illegally, and that their closeness to a highway presents a danger to those who inhabit them. A Jahalin tribe of Bedouin established the encampment after it was expelled by Israeli forces from southern Israel in the 1950s, according to Reuters. The outlet also reported that the Bedouin live in tin and wood shacks, and raise sheep and goats there.
In May, Israel’s Supreme Court approved the demolition, as the encampment was built without required construction permits. Israeli authorities approved 1.5 percent of construction permit requests by Palestinians between 2010 and 2014, according to the United Nations. Israel agreed to resettle the approximately 180 residents about seven miles (12 km) from the encampment.
Israel captured the territory on which the Bedouin reside in the 1967 war with neighboring Arab countries. Israeli settlements were later built around the encampment.
On Tuesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called for Israel to stop its demolition plans, saying, “International humanitarian law prohibits the forced transfer of the population of an occupied territory, regardless of the motive.”
Under the Oslo Accords agreed to in the 1990s, the West Bank was divided into three areas with different levels of autonomy. The encampment is located in what is known as Area C, which contains about 60 percent of the West Bank and is under full Israeli control, according to The Associated Press. Area C has about 400,000 Israeli settlers and 150,000 to 200,000 Palestinians, AP reported.

38599,2018-07-07,"Ex-navy diver dies after delivering oxygen to Thai boys trapped in cave, rescue efforts continue","A former Thai navy diver died on Friday during part of the operation to rescue the boys soccer team that is trapped in a cave in Thailand due to flooding. Earlier this week, all 12 boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach were found alive inside the Tham Luang cave complex, in the Chiang Rai region. The diver, Petty Officer Saman Gunan, had been delivering oxygen to the boys and lost consciousness on the dive out of the cave. His diving partner was unable to revive him. 
“His job was to deliver oxygen. He did not have enough on his way back,” said Passakorn Boonyaluck, deputy governor of the Chiang Rai region. Saman, 38, had left the navy, but returned to aid in the operation. The king of Thailand announced he would sponsor the funeral. 
The soccer team entered the cave when it was dry. It began flooding and the team took shelter on a ledge above water in a cavern about two weeks ago, on June 23. They were found on Monday by a British diving team. Thai and international rescuers have brought food, oxygen and supplies to the team where they are trapped about 2.5 miles (4 km) from the entrance. With the cave flooded, it is about an 11 hour diving journey from the entrance to the boys and back, BBC reported. 
Initially, officials believed the team could remain in the cave until the water levels dropped enough for everyone to walk out, which could be up to four months from now; officials changed their minds due to falling oxygen levels. The oxygen level in the area where the boys are trapped has dropped to about 15 percent, Thai Navy SEAL chief Rear Adm. Aphakorn Yoo-kongkaew said. The usual level is 21 percent, and the decrease poses a risk of hypoxia, which is the same condition that causes altitude sickness. A heavy monsoon is also forecast for Sunday, which could increase the flood levels.
In addition to the possibility of bringing the soccer team out with divers, rescue operations are assessing whether the area where the boys are can be reached from above. Thai soldiers and National Park Authority workers traveled about 12 miles (20 km) from the cave’s main entrance in an attempt to find a suitable area to reach the boys. Rock climbing teams have descended into some holes in the rocks, but have not found a suitable access point yet, CNN reported on Monday morning. 
Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, also announced on Friday that engineers from SpaceX and The Boring Company would travel to the area to aid the Thai government in the operation. They’re scheduled to arrive on Saturday.

38609,2018-07-07,Judge denies DOJ request to extend deadlines for migrant parent-children reunifications,"On Friday, a U.S. federal judge denied the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) request for an extension to a court-ordered deadline to reunite migrant parents with their children after officials separated them after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Last week, Federal Judge Dana Sabraw ordered that children under five years old must be reunited with their parents by July 10, and older children must be reunited by July 26. The injunction applies to families separated both before and after the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” that was implemented in May. 
By Friday, all of the parents had spoken to their children by phone, in accordance with the court order, The Washington Post reported.
The court documents filed by the government said the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the housing of the separated children, may not be able “to complete the additional processes within the timelines the Court prescribed, particularly with regard to class members who are already not in Government custody, (e.g., because they have previously been paroled or released).” 
The DOJ documents describe the government’s work, which consists of collecting information from the Departments of Homeland Security and HHS, verifying each child’s parentage (including with DNA testing), and determining the parents’ ""fitness"" to receive custody of their children. 
Officials were working nights and weekends to review files and conduct DNA tests, the court filing said. The document said that some tests for parentage were inconclusive, slowing the process of matching parents with their children.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has run approximately 300 background checks, which include criminal and immigration histories, and has 1,400 more to complete.
The court filings said officials have identified 101 children under five years old who were separated from their parents, and that they have located 40 of their parents in federal immigration custody and nine parents with U.S. marshals.
Robert Guadian, acting deputy assistant director of ICE’s enforcement and removal operations, said the reunification process was “difficult and time consuming.” He said ICE does not track whether the adults it detains for deportation have been separated from any children they may have, and the agency has to check with two other agencies to reunite families. Guadian also said the parents of the children under the age of five housed in HHS facilities are being detained in 23 immigration detention facilities across 13 states.
According to HHS Secretary Alex Azar, fewer than 3,000 children were separated from their parents and the government knows the location and identities of all minors under HHS care.

38603,2018-07-07,Former Pakistani prime minister sentenced on corruption charges,"Pakistan’s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was sentenced on Friday to 10 years in prison by the country’s Supreme Court on charges relating to property his family owned but had not declared. Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz and her husband Muhammad Safdar were also convicted and sentenced to seven years and one year in prison, respectively. All three deny the charges.
Sharif, 68, and his daughter were tried in absentia, as the family is in London while Sharif’s wife receives treatment for cancer, The New York Times and NBC News reported. 
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court sentenced Sharif to 10 years for owning assets beyond his income level and one year for non-cooperation with the NAB, to be served concurrently. The court also fined Sharif $10.6 million, fined his daughter $2.65 million and ordered the seizure of the family’s four apartments near Hyde Park, in London, where Sharif was reportedly staying. The judge concluded in a written statement that Sharif had failed to disclose the source of funds used to purchase of the London properties and to report the purchase to tax authorities.  
The case resulted from disclosures about Sharif’s property made in the “Panama Papers” leak of last year.
Sharif founded the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. He has served as Pakistan’s prime minister three times, from 1990–93, 1997–99, and 2013–17. He was removed from power during a military coup in 1999. Sharif was subsequently charged with terrorism, and later lived in self-imposed exile, before returning to Pakistani politics in 2013. Last year, the Supreme Court ordered him removed from office for failing to report income from a company his son owned. Sharif denies the charges. 
Five months ago, after Sharif was removed from office, the Supreme Court ruled that he was prohibited from holding office for the remainder of his life. Sharif has said the charges against him are politically motivated and that Pakistan’s military is involved. The military denies it has become involved in civilian politics.   
Pakistan is scheduled to hold general elections on July 25. As part of her conviction, Nawaz was prohibited from running, as she had planned.

38606,2018-07-07,6 countries meet to discuss Iran nuclear agreement without US,"On Friday, ministers from the U.K, China, France, Germany and Russia met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Vienna to negotiate new terms to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that would compensate for the resumption of U.S. sanctions in August. U.S. President Donald Trump announced in May that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran could remain in the agreement if the other non-American signatories “guaranteed” his country’s interests.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini chaired the three hours of talks, before delivering a joint statement from the participants following the meeting. “Participants agreed to keep progress under close review and to reconvene the joint commission, including at ministerial level, as appropriate in order to advance common efforts,” Mogherini said. 
Zarif said Iran’s concerns “were addressed” in the meeting. “More details were disclosed,” he said. “And they make us more optimistic than we were yesterday.” He told reporters that the proposed changes to the agreement were not “precise” or “complete,” adding that it would be “up to the leadership in Tehran to decide whether Iran should remain in the deal.” 
The JCPOA 
The JCPOA, which was adopted in 2015 after 18 months of negotiations, was signed by Iran and six other nations: the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The agreement required Iran to give up about 98 percent of its enriched uranium, prohibited the country from producing nuclear weapons, and required it to allow nuclear inspections. 
Under the terms of the deal, Iran confirmed that under no circumstances would it seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons. In exchange for agreeing to the restrictions, the U.S., European Union and other members of the United Nations lifted some sanctions on oil and other products from Iran.
On Jul. 20, 2015, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2231, endorsing the JCPOA.
Some requirements of the deal, such as limits on its uranium stores, are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2031 under various “sunset” clauses (or scheduled termination of certain provisions). Prior to the U.S. withdrawal, Trump criticized what he called “flaws in the deal,” including “insufficient enforcement” and the existence of the “sunset” clauses.

38780,2018-07-08,"More than 100 dead, dozens missing in Japan after rain-induced flooding and landslides (Update)","At least 103 people died and dozens more were missing in southwestern Japan from floods and landslides caused by rain over three days, authorities said on Monday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at least 90 died in the landslides, and 13 died later of cardiac arrest. Rains began late last week as the remnants of a typhoon combined with a seasonal front. 

The Japanese government set up an emergency management center at the prime minister’s office, and 54,000 people were involved in rescue operations. Evacuation orders or advisories were issued for up to 5.9 million people over 19 prefectures at one point, according to Kyodo News. By Monday, emergency rain warnings were lifted, as the rescue operations continued.
Rescue missions were carried out using boats and 40 helicopters, The Associated Press reported on Sunday. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, ""Rescue efforts are a battle with time. The rescue teams are doing their utmost.""
More than 30,000 people were staying in evacuation centers as of 3 p.m. local time on Sunday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said 10.4 inches (26.3 cm) of rain fell over a three-hour period in one area in Kochi prefecture. The prefecture, on Shikoku island, issued landslide warnings over the majority of its area, AP reported.
Kyodo News reported some deaths resulting from a landslide in Hiroshima.
Four people died, eight others were missing and 11 were injured in Okayama prefecture, according to the regional government. More than 570 homes were flooded there, with seven homes destroyed and dozens more damaged.

38775,2018-07-08,Pompeo says 2-day North Korea visit ‘productive’; North mentions ‘distrust’,"On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said his two days of talks with North Korean officials were “productive” and that “progress” was made on “almost all the central issues.” Later in the day, North Korea issued a statement through its state-run KCNA news agency that said “The issues the U.S. side insisted on at the talks are all roots of troubles, which the previous administrations also had insisted on to disrupt the dialogue processes, stoke the distrust and increase the danger of war.”
During his visit, Pompeo met with Gen. Kim Yong Chol, the vice chairman of the country's Party Central Committee. After a meeting of about three hours on Friday, Kim Yong Chol said there were aspects to “clarify,” and Pompeo said, “There are things that I have to clarify as well.” Pompeo did not meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Pompeo was “very firm” in pursuing three goals during the visit: the complete denuclearization of North Korea, security assurances and the repatriation of the remains of soldiers killed in the Korean War.
Nauert said Pompeo left Kim a letter from President Donald Trump. The North Korean statement said Pompeo had also been given a letter from Kim to Trump.
Nauert also said Pompeo called Washington on Saturday morning to update the president, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton on the talks.
Joining Pompeo on his trip were other officials from the State Department, as well as from the National Security Council and the CIA. On Saturday, Pompeo left North Korea for Tokyo, where he briefed Japanese and South Korean officials on the talks on Sunday.
Pompeo’s comments after the meetings
Before leaving Pyongyang for Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters, ""We had many hours of productive conversations. These are complicated issues, but we've made progress on almost all the central issues. Some places, a great deal of progress. Other places, there's still more work to be done."" 
When asked whether he raised the subject of satellite images possibly showing North Korean nuclear facility expansions, Pompeo said, ""‎We talked about what the North Koreans are continuing to do and how it's the case we can get our arms around achieving what Chairman Kim and President Trump both agreed to, which was the complete denuclearization of North Korea."" He added, “They’re still equally committed. Chairman Kim is still committed [to denuclearization].”
Pompeo also said the two sides had discussed “what the modalities would look like” for the destruction of the North Korean missile engine testing facility, and said there was “some progress there as well.” He said, “we have laid out a path for further negotiations at the working level so that the two teams can get together and continue these discussions.” Nauert said the two countries agreed to set up working groups in the future to discuss the “nitty-gritty stuff,” including how the U.S. would verify North Korean efforts to denuclearize.
At Trump and Kim’s June 12 meeting in Singapore, they agreed to the repatriation of U.S. soldiers’ remains from North Korea. Trump said last month at a rally in Minnesota that 200 U.S. service members’ remains had “been sent back.” U.S. military officials later said they had not received any remains.
Pompeo said the two sides set up a meeting in Panmunjom for July 12 that “could move by one day or two,” in which officials would discuss the repatriation of remains at the border, and that the “process will begin to develop over the days that follow.” He added that it was a “very productive conversation about the process by which we will deliver on the commitments that were made in the Singapore summit.”
North Korea’s statement
The North Korean statement said, “the U.S. side came up only with its unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization just calling for [complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization] … all of which run counter to the spirit of the Singapore summit meeting and talks.” The statement added, “We expected the U.S. to bring constructive measures to build confidence in accordance with the spirit of the U.S.-North Korea Summit.”
The statement said that “a shorter way to denuclearization on the Korean peninsula is to remove deep-rooted mistrust” and “follow the principle of simultaneous actions in resolving what is feasible one by one while giving priority to creating trust.”
The statement said the U.S.’ suspension of joint military exercises with South Korea was “highly reversible” and could be “resumed anytime at any moment as all of its military force remains intact in its previously-held positions.” It added that “this is incomparable with the irreversible step taken by the DPRK to explode and dismantle the nuclear test ground.”
The North Korean “side, during the talks, put forward the constructive proposals to seek a balanced implementation of all the provisions of the Joint Statement [from Singapore] out of its firm willingness to remain faithful to the implementation of the spirit and agreed points of the DPRK-U.S. summit meeting and talks,” the statement read.
It continued, “These include taking wide-ranging proactive steps of simultaneous actions in a respective manner such as realizing multilateral exchanges for improved relations between” North Korea and the U.S.; “making public a declaration on the end of [the Korean] war … to build a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula; dismantling the test ground of high thrust engine[s] to make a physical verification of the suspension of ICBM production as part of denuclearization steps”; and “making an earliest start of the working-level talks for recovering POW/MIA remains.”
The North’s statement said, “The U.S. side never mentioned the issue of establishing a peace regime on the Korean peninsula which is essential for defusing tension and preventing a war.”
The statement also read, “We still cherish our good faith in President Trump.”
The White House declined to comment on North Korea’s statement, according to CNN.
On Sunday in Tokyo, Pompeo said, ""If those [disarmament] requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster, because there was a unanimous decision at the UN Security Council about what needs to be achieved.” He also said, “Sanctions will remain in place until final, fully verified denuclearisation as agreed to by Chairman Kim occurs.”

38823,2018-07-09,8 boys total rescued from Thai cave (Update),"On Sunday, Chiang Rai acting Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn confirmed that four boys had been rescued from the Tham Luang cave in Thailand, where their soccer team and coach became trapped on June 23. Officials said the four boys’ conditions were “not that bad,” and they were taken to a hospital about 35 miles (56 km) away for further evaluation. Rescue operations resumed on Monday and four more boys were rescued.
The four boys rescued Monday were also taken to the hospital for evaluation. That day, Narongsak said, ""I insist that all [boys and their coach] will be safe and sound.”
In between rescue operations, divers must replenish the supply of oxygen tanks along the route, a process that takes about 10 to 20 hours, according to Narongsak. A team of 90 divers, including 40 from Thailand, have participated in the rescue operation since it started. Narongsak said 13 foreign divers and five Thai navy SEALs aided in the operation on Sunday. He said rescuers had been rehearsing the operation over the last three or four days.
On Sunday, rescuers said water levels had dropped in the cave by nearly a foot since the previous day. There had been a lack of rain in the preceding days, and authorities had been pumping water out of the caves. “We have reached peak readiness,” Narongsak said. “The meaning of readiness is… perfect weather, water and the kids’ readiness, physical (sic) and mentally.”
The boys, their coach and their families had all agreed that they should be moved out as soon as possible, according to Narongsak. 
Authorities decided to start the rescue attempt at 10 a.m. local time Sunday. Narongsak said the first boy came out of the cave at 5:40 p.m. local time, the next 10 minutes later, and the other two at 7:40 and 7:50 p.m. local time. Authorities did not release the names of the four boys to the media. 
Authorities ordered media away from the cave before the rescue to clear a path for transporting them to the hospital and to protect their privacy, according to The Associated Press. The hospital evaluation was to include an examination of the boys for potential long-term health effects from lack of oxygen, since levels in the cave were measured at 15 percent. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers an oxygen level below 19.5 percent to be “oxygen-deficient and immediately dangerous to life or health.”
The trip out of the cave
British divers found the team about 2.5 miles (4 km) from the cave entrance last Monday. The trip out of the cave involved wading in water, diving along guide ropes placed by previous divers, walking and climbing. The boys had been learning to dive since rescuers found them on July 2. During the diving sections, the boys wore full-face masks, and two experienced divers accompanied them and carried their air tanks. 
The boys traveled more than half a mile underwater, according to NBC News. In the first 0.6 miles (1 km) of the trip, the boys had to pass through a flooded channel that was narrow enough that divers were required to hold their oxygen tanks in front of them because they could not fit through the channel with the tanks on their backs. 
The round trip to where the team was and back out of the cave was previously reported to take about 11 hours. After efforts to drain some water from the cave, the round trip may have been shortened by at least three and a half hours, CNN reported. Officials had at one point estimated the trip out of the cave could take the boys two to four days to complete.
On Friday, former Thai navy SEAL, Saman Gunan, died while returning from delivering oxygen tanks in the cave. 
The soccer team entered the cave when it was dry. When it began flooding, the team took shelter on a ledge above water in a cavern. To hydrate, the boys licked drops of water off the cave wall prior to the divers discovering them, according to NBC News. Thai and international rescuers have brought food, oxygen and supplies to the team while they await rescue.
Future operations
On Sunday, Narongsak said, “There’s no time limit on the operation. It depends on the weather. It depends on the water levels. If something changes we’ll stop. But I expect the operation to finish in the next couple of days.” 
Forecasters have predicted monsoon rains in the coming days. The monsoon season could flood the route out of the caves until October, CNN reported. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said there is an 80 to 90 percent chance of rain Monday through Wednesday, and the long-term forecast predicts rain for the next seven to 10 days. Rain began falling after the first four boys exited the cave on Sunday.
A spokesman for Elon Musk’s Boring Company, which has four engineers at the cave, said Sunday that Thai officials had requested what Musk called a “tiny kid-sized submarine” made “using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of [a Space X] Falcon rocket as [a] hull” be sent to them. The “mini-sub” could possibly be used in future rescues. Musk tweeted at 5:49 p.m. EDT on Sunday that it would be arriving in Thailand in about 17 hours, which would have put it there at about 9:49 p.m. local time (10:49 a.m. EDT) on Monday.

38815,2018-07-09,"Turkish emergency decree dismisses 18,632 civil servants, closes 3 newspapers, 1 TV channel","Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan issued an emergency decree on Sunday dismissing 18,632 civil servants, including nearly 9,000 police officers, 6,000 soldiers and hundreds of teachers and academics. The decree, published in the Official Gazette, said the passports of those fired will be cancelled, The Associated Press reported. The government also closed three newspapers, a TV channel and 12 non-governmental organizations. Turkey has been under a state of emergency since a failed coup in July 2016. 
The decree also annulled the ranks of 1,500 retired military and police officers, cancelling their passports and pensions. The decree additionally reinstated 148 people who had been previously been fired as a result of earlier emergency decrees.
Since the coup attempt, the government has dismissed more than 125,000 people and jailed 160,000, according to BBC. Some Western countries have criticized the arrests as ways of reducing dissent. Turkey has said its emergency measures have been necessary to maintain national security.
The current state of emergency is set to expire on July 18 if the president does not extend it. Erdoğan has said he would end it.
Erdoğan is due to be sworn in again as president on Monday, after he was re-elected with 53 percent of the vote last month. In April, he called for early elections. He will have new powers once he is sworn in, resulting from a referendum last year that approved constitutional changes, including abolishing the prime minister’s position and reducing the powers of parliament, which Erdoğan’s AKP party controls. He will also be able to appoint ministers and vice-presidents, and choose a greater number of senior judges. He said his new powers will help Turkey defeat Kurdish rebels in the country’s south-east and improve the economy. 
Erdoğan was Turkey’s prime minister from 2003 to 2014 before being elected president in 2014.

38984,2018-07-10,Federal court rules against increasing 20-day limit on immigrant child detentions,"A federal judge in California denied the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) request to amend the “Flores settlement” to allow immigrant children to be detained for more than 20 days, including with their families. The ruling on Monday upheld a 2016 court interpretation of the settlement, which said the government could not detain immigrant children for more than 20 days. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee said the DOJ’s request was ""wholly without merit,"" adding that “nothing prevents” the Trump administration from reconsidering its “current blanket policy of family detention and reinstating prosecutorial discretion.”

“Prosecutorial discretion” differs from the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy,” which initially called for all adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes. Changing the policy could allow some families to be released on bond until the immigrant adult’s court date. 
The Trump administration implemented its “zero-tolerance policy” in May, leading to more than 2,000 children being separated from illegal immigrant adults. On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order requesting that the attorney general seek amendment of the 1997 Flores settlement in court so the government could “detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.” 
The DOJ also requested that the Flores settlement be amended regarding the types of licensed facilities in which children could be held.
Gee, the judge, said the DOJ’s request was effectively seeking to “light a match” to the Flores settlement. ""It is apparent that [the DOJ’s request] is a cynical attempt . . . to shift responsibility to the Judiciary for over 20 years of Congressional inaction and ill-considered Executive action that have led to the current stalemate,” she wrote. 
Gee also ruled against the government in 2015 when the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration argued that detaining all illegal immigrant families could act as a deterrent against illegal immigration. In the filing it submitted last month, the DOJ made reference to the previous administration’s arguments. In her ruling, Gee responded, “As it did before, the Court finds Defendants’ logic ‘dubious’ and unconvincing.”
DOJ spokesman Devin O'Malley said Monday that department attorneys were reviewing the decision. 
""We disagree with the court's ruling declining to amend the Flores [settlement] to recognize the current crisis of families making the dangerous and unlawful journey across our southern border,” O’Malley said. He added that “the court does appear to acknowledge that parents who cross the border will not be released and must choose between remaining in family custody with their children pending immigration proceedings or requesting separation from their children so the child may be placed with a sponsor.”
On June 26, another California court ruled that the government must reunite children under the age of five with their parents by Tuesday, and older children by July 26. On Monday, the government said about 40 of the approximately 100 children under five years old in its custody would not be reunited with their parents by the Tuesday deadline. It said the children had either not yet been matched with their parents, such as through DNA testing, or the government had not yet determined if the parents were fit to take custody of the children.

38973,2018-07-10,Remaining 4 boys and coach rescued from Thai cave,"The remaining four boys and their soccer coach were rescued from a cave in Thailand on Tuesday, 17 days after they and their other team members became trapped by rising waters in the cave. Authorities transported the boys and their coach to the same hospital as the eight other boys who were rescued on Sunday and Monday. 
""All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave,” confirmed the Thai Navy SEALs Facebook page. “All are safe.”
Tuesday’s rescue operation involved 19 divers entering the cave at 10 a.m. local time, and took about nine hours total. The last group to come out of the cave was comprised of four Navy SEALs, including a doctor who had stayed with the team for a week in the cave after British divers discovered the team on July 2. The ongoing rescue operations have involved a total of 90 divers, 40 from Thailand and 50 international. 
Jedsada Chokedamrongsook, the permanent secretary of the Thai Health Ministry, said the first group of four boys taken out of the cave on Sunday were 14 to 16 years old, and the second group of boys, taken out on Monday, were 12 to 14 years old. Medical officials said on Tuesday the eight boys who were rescued on those days did not have fevers and ""seem to be in high spirits.""
Chokedamrongsook said the families of the first four rescued boys had been able to see their children through a window and talk to them on the phone. If tests show the boys to be free of infection, the families will be allowed to enter the room with them. The hospital has sent samples to Bangkok for testing. Histoplasmosis is one possible infection they could be testing for since it can develop from breathing fungal spores from bird and bat droppings, according to the Mayo Clinic. The boys may stay in the hospital for seven days due to their weakened immune systems, CNN reported.
The boys traveled more than half a mile underwater during the trip out of the cave, according to NBC News. During the diving sections, the boys wore full face masks and wet suits, and two experienced divers accompanied them and carried their air tanks. 
Before the final rescue operation, Narongsuk Keasub, a diver for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand who delivered air tanks into the caves, said, “every step of the extraction is risky,” noting the conditions of the cave. “We can only see our hands [at a] short distance,” he said. “Secondly, the stones are razor sharp which is dangerous for our diving, [and] thirdly the passage is very narrow.”

38917,2018-07-10,"Boris Johnson resigns as UK foreign secretary, citing objections to EU exit proposal","Boris Johnson resigned as the British foreign secretary on Monday, saying he could not “in all conscience champion” an agreement reached Friday by the cabinet on the U.K.’s exit from the EU. Two other U.K. members of parliament also resigned from ministerial positions on Sunday, saying they did not support the agreement. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said the agreement would “honor the result of the referendum” to leave the EU.
At Friday’s meeting, called Chequers after the prime minister’s country estate where discussions took place, the cabinet approved a “vision for a relationship” with the EU that it said works “for both sides, underpinning shared prosperity and security.” 
Following the agreement, David Davis resigned as Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and Steve Baker resigned as a minister in the same department on Sunday. Johnson, who campaigned to leave the union before the 2016 referendum, then resigned as foreign secretary, saying that the agreement did not “represent the interests” of the British people. 
The U.K. and the EU have not negotiated a final agreement on aspects of the U.K.’s exit from the union, which is planned for March 29, 2019. The deadline for this agreement was set when the U.K. initiated exit proceedings under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Among the issues to be negotiated are trade agreements, financial obligations, adherence to regulatory standards for goods and customs, and residency of EU citizens in the U.K. and vice versa.
May said the Chequers agreement resulted from ""productive discussions,"" and would give the U.K. “control” of its borders, law and money, in accordance with the referendum to leave the EU. The U.K. voted 51.89 to 48.11 percent in favor of leaving the union. May, who had initially supported the campaign to remain in the EU, took over the prime ministership in July 2016 when David Cameron, who also supported remaining in the union, resigned.

Chequers agreement
The government released a statement on the preliminary agreement, which was reached after a 12-hour meeting, that said the U.K. and EU would:

	“Establish a free trade area for goods.”
	Maintain a “common rulebook for all goods,” by “harmoniz[ing]” with EU rules. Parliament would have the ability to incorporate these rules into U.K. law and the ability to choose not to.
	Establish “strong reciprocal commitments related to open and fair trade,” such as state aid and regulatory standards for environment, climate change, employment, and consumer protection.
	Create a “joint institutional framework to provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements by both parties,” through U.K. and EU courts and “with regard” to EU case law.
	Introduce a “Facilitated Customs Arrangement” that would “remove the need for customs checks and controls” between the U.K. and EU, as if they were a “combined customs territory.”

The government announced on Friday it would publish a white paper with details of the proposal the following week.  
Resignations
Johnson, who had served as the Foreign Secretary since June 2016, outlined the  reasons for his resignation in a letter that he posted on Twitter. In it, he said the U.K. was headed for the “status of colony,” and criticized aspects of the Chequers agreement, “above all” that involved “accepting” that the U.K. would not be able to “pass laws independently” from the EU, and “in the interests of the people of” the U.K. 
In a letter accepting Johnson’s resignation, May wrote, “the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down.” May said in a statement to the House of Commons that she wanted to “recognize” Johnson’s “passion … in promoting a global Britain to the world” as the country leaves the EU. 
Jeremy Hunt, who was the Health Secretary, was named as Johnson’s replacement later on Monday, and Matt Hancock was named the new Health Secretary. 
Davis, who resigned as the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, had been appointed to the position in 2016. He said Sunday that the “best person” to be Secretary “is someone who really believes in” the Chequers agreement, not him. Following his resignation, Dominic Raab, who had been the housing minister, was promoted to the EU secretary position. May said she wanted to “recognize” Davis’ work to “steer through parliament some of the most important legislation for generations.” 
Baker, who resigned as under-secretary in the Department for Exiting the EU said he would not be able to “represent” the Chequers policy “as my own policy and therefore I can’t be in the government.” He said he had working on a White Paper for the exit from the EU that “did not accord with what was put to the cabinet” at Chequers on Friday.
Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the British cabinet resignations did nothing to “solve the mess caused by Brexit,” the colloquial name for the British exit from the EU. The European Commission declined to comment to the BBC.

38929,2018-07-10,Trump nominates Brett Kavanaugh to Supreme Court,"President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill Justice Anthony Kennedy’s position, which will become vacant at his planned July 31 retirement. Speaking from the White House on Monday evening, Trump said it was his “honor and privilege” to nominate Kavanaugh, a current judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Kavanaugh, who was joined at the podium by his wife and two daughters, thanked the president. 
Kavanaugh, 53, was nominated to the Court of Appeals by then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and confirmed in 2006, and has served on the bench for 12 years. He has a “conservative” judicial record, according to The New York Times and The Washington Post. Trump said in his speech that Kavanaugh has authored more than 300 opinions on the bench with a “clear and effective writing style,” eleven of which have been adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court, according to the White House. 
Earlier Monday, the White House said former Senator Jon Kyl (R) of Arizona would serve as a guide to the nominee, now known to be Kavanaugh, as he meets with the Senate Judiciary Committee and other senators during the confirmation process. 
Kavanaugh requires a majority vote from the Senate to be confirmed for the Supreme Court seat. The GOP technically has 51 of the 100 seats in the Senate, but with Senator John McCain of Arizona absent while he receives treatment for brain cancer, Republicans hold 50 seats, while Democrats and independents hold 49. In the case of a tie, Vice President Mike Pence holds the deciding vote. 
During the announcement, Trump thanked lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for consultations during the nomination process, and asked the Senate to quickly confirm Kavanaugh to the court. 
Prior to his position on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Kavanaugh served as an aide to President George W. Bush and in the 1990s was a clerk to Kennedy. He graduated from Yale as an undergraduate and Yale Law School. He also teaches law at Harvard, Yale and Georgetown, Trump said in his announcement. 
Kavanaugh said he learned from his mother the importance of “equality for all Americans.” Both of his parents practiced law, he said. Kavanaugh described his “judicial philosophy” by saying a “judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law.” He said a judge must interpret statutes and the constitution “as written, informed by history, and tradition, and precedent.” He also said he believes and teaches that the constitution’s separation of powers “protects individual liberty.”
Kavanaugh said that if confirmed by the Senate, he would “keep an open mind in every case,” and “always strive to preserve the constitution of the United States and the rule of law.”

38921,2018-07-10,Ethiopia and Eritrea officially declare war between them is over,"On Monday, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea's President Isaias Afewerki signed a declaration ending the state of war between the two countries. The conflict originated in 1998 over the border between the countries, five years after Eritrea declared its independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Fighting ended in 2000, after at least 80,000 were killed, with a peace deal that was never fully implemented. 

Monday’s meeting, which took place in the Eritrean capital city of Asmara was the first time the leaders of the two countries had met in 20 years.
The peace deal, called the Algiers Agreement, was reached in 2000 and never fully implemented. Abiy, who became Ethiopia’s prime minister in April after former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned in February, said in his inaugural address that he was “fully committed to reconcile” with Eritrea. In June, Ethiopia announced it would accept the terms of the 2000 peace agreement and later that month, Eritrea announced it would send a delegation to Ethiopia’s capital.
Since the border conflict, there have been no flights between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the land border has remained closed and telephone lines between the countries have not worked. On Monday, Eritrea’s Minister of Information Yemane Meskel said on Twitter that transport, trade and telecommunication ties would resume. Family members across the border were able to phone each other on Monday, according to BBC. 
Abiy’s Chief of Staff Fitsum Arega also tweeted that the two countries “are determined to close a costly chapter and eager to make up for lost opportunities putting the interest and aspirations of their people at the center.” He added that the two nations would “forge close political, economic, social, cultural  security cooperation,” and would “work on regional peace “

39085,2018-07-11,Member of German National Socialist Underground sentenced to life in prison for role in 10 murders,"On Wednesday, a Munich court sentenced Beate Zschäepe, a member of a group called the National Socialist Underground (NSU), to life in prison after convicting her on 10 counts of murder for her participation in the killings of eight Turks, one Greek and a German police officer from 2000 to 2007. The three-member NSU also was responsible for two bombings in areas of Cologne with Turkish immigrant populations, and for 15 bank robberies, according to prosecutors. Zschäepe denied having prior knowledge of the murders, which were allegedly carried out by the other two NSU members.
The judges said Zschäepe, 43, bore a “particularly heavy guilt,” and gave her the maximum possible sentence. After a five-year trial, Zschaepe was also found guilty of arson, being a member of a terrorist organization and being a co-perpetrator in two bombings.
Zschäepe’s lawyer, Mathias Grasel, called the verdict “wrong” and said he would appeal the ruling. Grasel said, “Conviction for complicity is legally untenable. The fact is: Ms. Zschäepe was demonstrably present at no crime scene and never fired a weapon or detonated a bomb.”
Zschäepe later said she felt morally responsible for not stopping the two men in the NSU from committing the murders, and apologized to the victims’ families. In her closing statement in court last week, she said, ""I am a compassionate person and was able to see and feel the distress and despair of the families.”
NSU members Uwe Böehnhardt and Uwe Mundlos allegedly committed the murders. The two men killed themselves in 2011 when police located them after they allegedly robbed a bank. Investigators then connected the group to the murders, according to NBC News. Zschäepe later turned herself in to police. Prosecutors said she was involved in planning the murders and providing money and alibis for the men.
The chairman of a parliamentary inquest, Uli Gröetsch, alleged that the three NSU members were “supported by a broad network of neo-Nazis.” Four men were also found guilty of supporting the NSU, including by the procurement ofweapons, and were sentenced to between two and a half and 10 years in prison.
The NSU is described as a “neo-Nazi” group in the media, and Zschäepe has been called the “Nazi bride.”
Response to the verdict
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said, “What the perpetrators did cannot be made up for. The victims will never be forgotten.” He said diversity and enforcement of the law could help Germany reduce racially-motivated violence, according to Reuters.
Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said, “This is a just punishment for the NSU’s cold-blooded and unprecedented series of crimes.” Five of the 10 murders occurred in Bavaria. 
Turkey’s foreign ministry said, “Unfortunately, the ruling made today has not brought to light the real criminals, the background of the NSU murders and the connection between the deep state and intelligence to its full extent.” It did not elaborate further on the meaning of its statement.

39004,2018-07-11,Trump pardons two Oregon ranchers convicted of arson,"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump pardoned two Oregon cattle ranchers who had been in prison for setting fire to public land. Dwight Hammond Jr., 76, and his son Steven Hammond, 49, were convicted in 2012 of arson on Harney County land adjacent to their ranch. They were originally sentenced to less than the federally-mandated minimum of five years; they were re-sentenced in 2015 to a total served time of five years each, which the White House described as “unjust.”
Dwight and Steven Hammond were convicted of setting a fire in 2001 and Steven was convicted of setting a second fire in 2006. Dwight had set a prescribed burn on about 300 acres of his land as a means to stop invasive species, according to his lawyers. The fire spread to federal land where it burned about 139 acres. Prosecutors alleged the fire was also set to destroy evidence of illegal deer poaching, and that firefighters were endangered by the fire and some needed to be airlifted to safety.
U.S. District Judge Michael R. Hogan initially did not apply the five-year minimum sentence for arson mandated under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. He said a five-year sentence “would not meet any idea I have of justice, proportionality ... it would be a sentence which would shock the conscience to me.” Hogan sentenced Dwight to three months in prison and Steven to a year and a day.
The Department of Justice appealed the sentence, and in October 2015, a federal appeals court ordered that the Hammonds be re-sentenced to the mandatory minimum, accounting for time already served. In protest of the resentencing, armed citizens occupied the federal refuge near the Hammond’s farm for 41 days. The Hammonds were returned to prison in 2016 to complete five-year sentences. 
As of July, Dwight has served two years and nine months in prison and Steven three years and four months. The two were being held in a federal detention center south of Los Angeles. The White House did not say when they would be released.
The pardon
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said federal prosecutors in the case had filed an “overzealous appeal” and that the resulting five-year prison sentence for the Hammonds was “unjust.” She also said, “The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds’ responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges.”
“The Hammonds are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community and have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement and farmers and ranchers across the West,” Sanders said. “Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.''
In their clemency petitions, the Hammonds’ lawyers cited their service to the community, the severity of the punishment, Judge Hogan’s support for clemency, and the Hammonds’ family situation, including difficulties in sustaining their cattle operation due to government’s denial of a grazing permit in 2014.
U.S. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward, Malheur County Sheriff Brian Wolfe, and leaders of the Oregon Cattlemen’s Association and Oregon Farm Bureau wrote letters of support for the Hammonds’ clemency petitions.
Steven Hammond’s attorney, Larry Matasar, wrote, “Unlike some cases where clemency may outrage the community, clemency for the Hammonds would be embraced by the Oregon community, both rural and urban.” 
Occupation of the wildlife refuge
Following the Hammonds’ re-sentencing in 2015, dozens of armed people occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that borders the Hammond family ranch in southeastern Oregon for 41 days. Two sons of a Nevada rancher, Cliven Bundy, led the occupation, and one of the sons, Ammon Bundy, cited the Hammond case as a reason for it. He said the federal government had a limited right to own property in the state, according to The Associated Press. 
The occupation ended after Oregon State Police shot dead one of the occupiers, LaVoy Finicum, and Ammon and Ryan Bundy were arrested. In 2016, a federal court jury in Portland acquitted the Bundy brothers and five other defendants of charges related to the occupation.
Responses to the pardons
Walden, the congressman who advocated granting the pardon, said, ""Today is a win for justice and an acknowledgement of our unique way of life in the high desert, rural West.” He added, ""I applaud President Trump for thoroughly reviewing the facts of this case, rightly determining the Hammonds were treated unfairly and taking action to correct this injustice.''
Amanda Marshall, Oregon’s U.S. attorney at the time of the appeal, said the pardons, as opposed to commuting their sentences, means their conviction does not exist. “I find that incredibly troubling” Marshall said. “I think it's a slap in the face to the people in Pendleton who served on that jury and a slap in the face to the Constitution.'”
Marshall said Judge Hogan issuing shorter sentences than mandated by Congress violated the law. She also noted the Hammonds could have been sentenced to less than a year in prison under a plea offer they did not accept.
The president of the non-profit group Defenders of Wildlife, Jamie Rappaport Clark, said he hoped the pardon was “not seen as an encouragement to those who might use violence to seize federal property and threaten federal employees.”
Ryan Bundy, one of the leaders of the wildlife refuge occupation, called the pardon “long overdue.”

39001,2018-07-11,"Israel restricts imports into Gaza through border crossing, prohibits exports","On Tuesday, Israel began enforcing restrictions on goods that pass through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza, after announcing them the previous day. All exports from Gaza through the crossing were banned and imports can only include food, medicine and “humanitarian equipment.” The decision was made in response to incendiary kites and balloons that have been sent across the border into Israel by protesting Palestinians, Israel said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said while announcing the restrictions on Monday that Israel would “weigh down heavier on Hamas’s leadership, effective immediately.” He said there would be “additional steps” taken, saying he would not “go into details.” 
Palestinians have been protesting the partial naval, air and land blockades that Israel and Egypt have imposed on Gaza since the 1990s and strengthened in 2007, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israel said the fires from kites and balloons sent across the border have caused about $2.5 million in damage to Israeli farmland. Israeli officials said by mid-June, 412 fires had been started by incendiary flying objects, The New York Times reported. The Israeli army said it has used drones to shoot down 670 of the kites and balloons. 
Israel has not used lethal force against people launching incendiary devices, the Times reported. It has fired warning shots and destroyed vehicles belonging to the people involved.
Hamas, the political organization that governs Gaza and has an armed division, has “encouraged” the launching of incendiary kites, according to the Times. Hamas called the crossing restrictions a “crime against the people of Gaza.” Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another armed group in Gaza, called the restrictions on the crossing a “declaration of war.” Israel and the U.S. consider both groups “terrorist” organizations.
During the first half of this year, 48,424 trucks brought imports through the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to United Nations figures, an average of about 268 per day. About a third of the trucks contained food and medical supplies, the Times reported. About 40 to 50 trucks containing Gaza exports would leave each day when the crossing was open to exports, Al Jazeera reported. Construction materials and clothing imports would be prohibited under Israel’s order, while cooking gas would not, according to Al Jazeera.
In addition to restricting the border crossing, Israel said it would be restricting Gaza’s fishing boats in the Mediterranean Sea, requiring them to stay within six nautical miles from shore. Israel had permitted the ships a nine nautical mile range for the past three months. Gaza has 4,000 registered fishermen, according to Nizar Ayash, head of Gaza’s fishermen’s union.
Palestinians in Gaza began protests on March 30 for the “right to return” for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted Palestinians the right to return. Israeli forces have reportedly killed at least 120 Palestinians since those protests began, with snipers shooting protesters who approached the border fence with Israel. Israel says it is protecting its borders. Some of the protesters launched incendiary kites and balloons as part of those protests. 
In June, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying it “deplores the use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force” by Israel against Palestinian civilians, “particularly in the Gaza strip.” The U.S. has said Israel has the right to defend itself.
Gaza has a population of more than two million people.

39185,2018-07-12,"At least 200 dead, 21 missing from Japan floods and landslides","At least 200 people were dead and 21 were missing in southwestern Japan after rain-induced flooding and landslides last week, according to Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said more than 700 homes had been destroyed or damaged, and more than 23,000 had been flooded. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited affected areas on Wednesday, saying “After seeing that, I even feel more strongly about doing whatever it takes so that the people who were affected could live safely again as soon as possible.” 
Floodwaters have dropped “in most places,” according to The Associated Press. The floods left behind debris including mud, broken trees, furniture and vehicles. More than 70,000 military, police and firefighters were searching the debris for bodies, Reuters reported.
More than 7,000 people were still in evacuation shelters after last week’s rains. There were power and water outages, and damage to roads and railway tracks resulted in limited deliveries of food and supplies to those affected. The government sent water trucks to evacuation centers, some of which had water shortages. High temperatures in the area ranged from 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit (31 to 34 degrees Celsius), according to Reuters. Some evacuation centers did not have sufficient air conditioning or fans.
More than 200,000 homes were without water, Reuters reported. McDonald’s said five of its stores in Hiroshima and one in Ehime had water outages. Some convenience stores were operating on shortened hours due to supply shortages or flooding. 
Abe visited Kurashiki on Wednesday, and said he saw “horrendous” damage there from floods. He canceled trips to Europe and the Middle East to address relief efforts. He was scheduled to visit two other affected areas on Friday and over the weekend.

39181,2018-07-12,North Korean officials absent for Thursday meeting on remains repatriation,"North Korean officials did not show up at the border between North and South Korea on Thursday for discussions on American remains repatriations, according to U.S. and South Korean officials who spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity. After his meeting with North Korean officials last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the two sides scheduled a meeting in Panmunjom on July 12 that “could move by one day or two,” in which officials would discuss the repatriation of remains. 
North Korean officials did not call or provide an explanation for their absence, according to CNN. American military officials were present at Panmunjom Thursday, the Times reported. When a reporter asked Pompeo in Brussels on Thursday about the planned meeting, he did not answer. He said Gen. Kim Yong Chol, an official he met with in Pyongyang, “made a commitment” that North Korea intends to denuclearize.
At President Donald Trump’s June 12 meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the two agreed to the repatriation of U.S. soldiers’ remains from North Korea. Trump said last month at a rally in Minnesota that 200 U.S. service members’ remains had “been sent back.” U.S. military officials later said they had not received any remains.
There are about 5,300 sets of remains in the North from U.S. service members who died during the Korean War, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates. Between 1996 and 2005, U.S. and North Korean workers recovered the remains of what were believed to be more than 220 American soldiers. The two sides suspended those efforts in 2005 as the North was developing nuclear weapons. 
Also on Thursday, Trump tweeted a letter he had received from Kim, calling it a “very nice note” and saying, “Great progress [is] being made!” In the letter, dated July 6, Kim thanked Trump for his “energetic and extraordinary efforts” made “for the improvement of relations between the two countries and the faithful implementation of the joint statement” they had signed in Singapore. Kim wrote, “I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach” of the two men “aimed at opening up a new future” between North Korea and the U.S. “will surely come to fruition.”

39111,2018-07-12,NATO members commit to ‘improving the balance of sharing’ defense costs while at summit,"Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) committed to better share defense costs on Wednesday, the first of a two-day meeting at NATO’s Brussels headquarters. The member countries said they were “committed to improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of alliance membership,” according to a declaration they signed.

NATO countries agreed in 2014 to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic products (GDP) by 2024. Last year, five of the 29 NATO member countries spent at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense: Britain, Estonia, Greece, Poland, and the U.S. 
Eight members are expected to spend the 2 percent GDP amount in 2018, and NATO estimated that 15 members were on track to meet the 2024 goal, Fox News reported. The eight countries expected to reach the goal this year are Britain, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and the US., Deutsche Welle reported. 
At the NATO meeting, U.S. President Donald Trump “suggested that countries not only meet their commitment of 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending, but that they increase it to 4 percent,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. “Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations."" 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said countries agreed to pledge to 2 percent. “Let’s start with that,” he said, adding “we have a way to go.”
The U.S. spent about 3.1 percent of its GDP on its military in 2017, according to The World Bank. Trump said the U.S is spending 4.2 percent of its GDP on defense “in actual numbers,” without elaborating on what he meant by that term. The day before the NATO summit, the U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday 97-2 to pass a non-binding resolution that reaffirmed the commitment of the U.S. to NATO.
On Wednesday, Trump tweeted, “Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.” 
Trump mentioned Germany in the same tweet. Germany spends about 1.24 percent of its GDP on its military. In 2017, Germany had a surplus of $63.7 billion in trade of goods with the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Germany contributed the second-highest number of troops to NATO and has been its second-largest net contributor.
Gas pipeline from Russia to Germany
In the Wednesday tweet, Trump also said, “What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy?”
Trump was referring to the the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will add two pipelines to the existing Nord Stream pipeline from Russia, and increase capacity to 3.9 trillion cubic feet of gas per year. The new pipelines in the Baltic Sea may begin delivering natural gas from Russia to Germany in late 2019, according to German newspaper Deutsche Welle. The project was opposed by the Obama administration and some European countries, such as Poland. 
“Germany, as far as I’m concerned, is captive to Russia because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia,” Trump told NATO head Stoltenberg. “We have to talk about the billions and billions of dollars that’s being paid to the country we’re supposed to be protecting you against. … I think it’s something that NATO has to look at.”
Trump said Germany would be getting between 60 and 70 percent of its energy from Russia and the new pipeline. Germany has said it is diversifying its natural gas supplies, and that right now it gets about nine percent of its energy from Russia. It also said the U.S. is trying to sell Germany liquified natural gas.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted, “We are no captives – neither of Russia nor of the United States.”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, said, “I myself experienced a part of Germany that was controlled by the Soviet Union, and I am very happy today that we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. We decide our own policies and make our own decisions, and that’s very good.”
Other discussions at the Wednesday meeting
Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron held a bilateral meeting on Wednesday, after which Trump met with Merkel for about an hour in a bilateral meeting. After the talks with Merkel, Trump called the meeting “great,” and said they discussed military expenditures and trade. “We have a very, very good relationship,” he said. Merkel said the U.S. and Germany are “good partners, and we wish to continue cooperating in the future.”
Also at the Wednesday meeting, NATO invited Macedonia to begin talks to join the group and decided to start a new NATO training mission in Iraq with “several hundred trainers” to “counter terrorism and maintain stability.” 
On Thursday, NATO leaders are scheduled to meet with the presidents of Georgia and Ukraine, and hold a meeting of “all nations contributing to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan.”
Trump is scheduled to visit Britain after the NATO summit, and meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday.

39119,2018-07-12,US Senate passes non-binding resolution requiring congressional approval on national security-based tariffs,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution calling on President Donald Trump to obtain congressional approval prior to using “national security concerns” as a justification for imposing tariffs on other countries. The Republican-drafted resolution passed 88 to 11, with 11 Republicans voting against the measure. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to invoke national security concerns to impose tariffs.
Trump invoked national security concerns when implementing 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports and 25 percent tariffs on steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU on June 1.
The resolution also directs lawmakers to include language in an unrelated spending bill that is being drafted that would grant Congress more authority to approve tariffs that are based on national security.
“This is a vote for Congress to assume its rightful role,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who cosponsored the resolution with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). 
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who voted for the resolution, said, “Let's be clear, this is a rebuke of the President's abuse of trade authority. Can you imagine being Canada and being told your steel and aluminum exports to the United States [are] a national security threat?”
Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who voted against the measure, said he did not understand why the Senate “continues to try to tie the hands of this President at every turn. We all know that enacting tariffs on all imports is not the goal here. This President is committed to creating a more level playing field for our workers and our companies here at home to compete.”
Recent trade measures with China
On Tuesday, the U.S. Office of the Trade Representative (USTR) released a list of Chinese goods, worth about $200 billion, on which the U.S. could introduce 10 percent tariffs. Trump had previously requested the list in case China retaliated against the U.S. for a 25 percent tariff it implemented on $34 billion-worth of Chinese imports. China later did impose retaliatory tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. 
U.S. tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against “unfair” or “discriminatory” trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded that “the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.”
The USTR provided a list of recommendations, including that the U.S. maintain the tariffs on the $34 billion of Chinese goods that the U.S. imposed on July 6, as well as continue the process to implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion-worth of goods from China. 
The USTR also recommended the U.S. hold a public comment period on the new list of $200 billion-worth of goods before imposing tariffs on them. The body set a schedule through Aug. 30 for public comments, a hearing on the comments, and submission of “post-hearing rebuttal comments.”
The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to the proposed U.S. tariffs on Wednesday. A spokesperson, Hua Chunying, said, ""We will take firm and forceful measures,” without specifying what those measures may include.

39104,2018-07-12,"Pfizer to organize into 3 businesses, reverses July 1 drug price increases","Pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced on Wednesday that it would change its structure from having two business units to having three. The previous businesses were Innovative Medicines and Essential Health. Starting in 2019, the new units are to be Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines, and Consumer Healthcare. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it would revert to its pre-July 1 prices on about three dozen drugs on which it had raised the prices at the start of this month. The company said it made its decision “following an extensive discussion with President Trump.”
Pfizer Chief Operating Officer Albert Bourla said the re-organization structure “gives us a sharper focus on diverse patients in diverse markets.” The Innovative Medicines business will include a new hospital business unit “for anti-infectives and sterile injectables.”
Last October, Pfizer said it was considering selling or spinning off its consumer healthcare business, worth about $15 billion. It is still evaluating options for this business and expects to make a decision on it in 2018, the company said. Pfizer’s revenue in 2017 was $52.55 billion.
Drug prices
Pfizer announced on Tuesday that the pre-July 1 prices would remain in effect until either the end of the year, or when Trump implements a “blueprint to strengthen the healthcare system and provide more access for patents,” whichever comes first. The company said it would return the drug prices to their pre-July 1 levels “a soon as technically possible.” It said the price decreases it had implemented on some drugs on July 1 would remain in effect.
Trump tweeted on Monday about Pfizer’s drug price increases, prior to the company’s announcement. “Pfizer  elsewhere. We will respond!”
Trump tweeted on Tuesday, “Just talked with Pfizer CEO and [Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar] on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so American patients don’t pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!”
Azar said Pfizer’s decision was “constructive, professional [and] appropriate.”
In May of this year, Trump announced a “blueprint” towards reducing drug prices. On May 30, he said within two weeks, some pharmaceutical companies would announce “voluntary massive drops in prices.” The White House has not announced other companies lowering prices since then.
Pfizer increased some drug prices earlier this year, on medications such as Viagra, Lipitor, Xanax and Chantix. Those price increases would stay in effect, CNN reported. On Jan. 1, Pfizer raised the price of Viagra by 9.5 percent, and then on July 1 the company raised its price again, by 9.4 percent. The second price increase would be reversed with the company’s Tuesday announcement.
A Wells Fargo Securities report said manufacturers increased the prices of 104 drugs in June and the first two days of July.

39297,2018-07-13,"12 Russians indicted in Mueller investigation, accused of hacking Clinton campaign","The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday that 12 named Russian military officials were indicted on charges related to alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including allegedly hacking into the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and releasing emails. The Russian government denies involvement. 
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced at a news conference on Friday that eleven of the defendants were “charged with conspiring to hack into computers, steal documents, and release those documents with the intent to interfere in the election.” One of those dependents along with a twelfth military officer were charged with conspiring to “infiltrate computers” of organizations that administer the election, such as state election boards. 
The defendants are members of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU), according to the indictment, which alleges they were acting within “their official capacities.” The GRU is a federal intelligence agency and reports directly to the Russian military’s General Staff. 
“There is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime,” Rosenstein said. “There is no allegation that the conspiracy altered the vote count or changed any election result.”
The indictment alleges that starting in March 2016, the GRU officials hacked into the DNC, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and members of the Clinton campaign, including then-campaign manager John Podesta. They are accused of gaining access to and monitoring the computers of dozens of Democratic officials and volunteers by for example, using phishing emails to gain access to accounts and implanting malware. (Phishing scam emails are often fraudulent emails masked to look as if they are from legitimate companies or organizations, and ask recipients to enter login or account information.)
Tens of thousands of emails that were obtained, the indictment alleges, were distributed through accounts of false personas, such as DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, in June 2016.
The Russian government has denied interfering with the election, and did so again on Friday. “The Russian state has never interfered and has no intention of interfering in the U.S. elections,” said Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin’s foreign affairs adviser.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin at a one-on-one summit on Monday in Helsinki, Finland. The White House said Friday that there was no plan to alter the scheduled meeting. 
Friday’s charges results from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian election interference and whether there was coordination with any members of the Trump campaign, and “related matters.” Prior to Friday, the investigation had led to 20 people and three companies being charged, including four former Trump campaign officials or White House officials on charges unrelated to the alleged election interference.

39228,2018-07-13,"In House hearings, FBI agent Strzok says personal opinions did not once ‘impact’ his official actions","On Thursday, two House committees held a public hearing and heard testimony from FBI agent Peter Strzok, who previously helped lead Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as an investigation into then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. In his opening statement to the committee, Strzok said under oath, “not once in my 26 years of defending my nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took.”
In 2016, Strzok, using his official FBI phone, sent multiple text messages critical of then-candidate Donald Trump to another FBI employee, Lisa Page, with whom he was romantically involved. Page has since resigned from the FBI, and the bureau reassigned Strzok off the Mueller investigation and into the human resources department. 
More than 70 members of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees were present at Strzok’s public hearing on Thursday. The hearing was on “Oversight of FBI and DOJ Actions Surrounding the 2016 Election: Testimony by FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok.” Last month, the committees interviewed Strzok in classified sessions for more than 11 hours.
OIG report that included Strzok’s text messages
Last month, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Justice Department (DOJ) released a report that reviewed “various actions” by the FBI and the DOJ ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The report included a text from Page to Strzok in August 2016, in which she said: “[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The report said the OIG was referring information on text messages sent by five employees, including Strzok, to the FBI to consider whether they violated the agency’s Offense Code of Conduct.
The OIG said the text messages “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.” It also said, “Our review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.”
Based on the text messages, the report said the OIG did not “have confidence” that one of Strzok’s decisions to prioritize the Russia investigation over the Clinton email investigation “was free from bias.” Strzok’s lawyer said, “all facts contained in the report lead to the conclusion that the delay [in the Clinton email investigation] was caused by a variety of factors and miscommunications that had nothing to do” with Strzok’s “political views.”
Strzok’s opening statement
In his opening statement to the committees, Strzok mentioned his text messages and said, “I criticized various countries and politicians, including Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, then-candidate Trump and others.” He also said, “Like many people, I had and expressed personal political opinions during an extraordinary Presidential election. Many contained expressions of concern for the security of our country — opinions that were not always expressed in terms I am proud of.”
Regarding his potential bias, Strzok said there is “one extraordinarily important piece of evidence supporting my integrity, the integrity of the FBI, and our lack of bias.” He continued, “In the summer of 2016, I was one of a handful of people who knew the details of Russian election interference and its possible connections with members of the Trump campaign. This information had the potential to derail, and quite possibly, defeat Mr. Trump. But the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind.”
In his opening statement, Strzok also said, “I am happy to answer any questions for which I have authorization to answer and where the FBI has directed me not to answer, I will abide by the FBI’s instructions.”
Representatives’ comments during the hearing
Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) began with a question about how many witnesses Strzok interviewed prior to his August 2016 “we’ll stop” text message. Strzok said the FBI’s legal counsel had directed him not to answer questions about an ongoing investigation. 
House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said, “Mr. Strzok, you are under subpoena and are required to answer the question.” Strzok later asked if he could consult with FBI counsel. Goodlatte said he could only consult with his own attorney, not the FBI’s. Other committee members made comments, and Goodlatte told Strzok, “Either comply with the committee’s directive or refuse to do so, the latter of which will place you at risk of a contempt citation and potential criminal liability.” 
When the hearing reconvened after a lunch recess, Strzok said FBI counsel told him he could answer the question, and in providing it, he said, “I don’t recall. I’d have to check the case file.”
During the hearing, Gowdy said, “Agent Strzok had Hillary Clinton winning the White House before he finished investigating her. Agent Strzok had Donald Trump impeached before he even started investigating him. That is bias. Agent Strzok may not see it but the rest of the country does, and it is not what we want, expect or deserve from any law enforcement officer much less the FBI.”
Gowdy also said, ""The moment Special Counsel Bob Mueller found out about Peter Strzok's text and emails he kicked him off of the investigation. But that was a year and a half too late. The text and emails may have been discovered in May of 2017, but the bias existed and was manifest a year and a half before that. All the way back to late 2015 and early 2016. So it wasn't the discovery of texts that got him fired, it was the bias manifest in those texts that made him unfit to objectively and dispassionately investigate.”
Strzok said, ""I am stating to you it is not my understanding that [Mueller] kicked me off because of any bias, that it was done based on the appearance.”
There were also some interruptions and shouting by lawmakers during other representatives’ comments at the hearing.
Page was subpoenaed to appear before the same committees in a closed-door session on Wednesday. Her lawyers said she would not testify that day, as she needed more time to prepare. She later agreed to testify in a closed session on Friday.

39187,2018-07-13,UK publishes White Paper proposal with details of ‘principled and practical Brexit’,"On Thursday, the British government released a “White Paper” titled “The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.” The government said the 104-page document provides a “detailed proposal for a principled and practical Brexit,” and that it explains how the U.K.-EU “relationship would work, what benefits it would deliver for both sides, and why it would respect the sovereignty of the U.K. as well as the autonomy of the EU.”
The White Paper expanded on the Chequers agreement released on July 6, which the cabinet approved as a “vision for a relationship” between the U.K. and the bloc.
The U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, after the country voted to leave the EU in a June 2016 referendum. 
The White Paper
The White Paper is divided into four chapters covering different areas of future cooperation between the EU and the U.K., including: economic partnership, security, cooperation in areas such as aviation and nuclear power, and “institutional frameworks” for enforcing agreements. 
The White Paper said there will be more trade barriers with the bloc after the U.K. leaves. The U.K. would use a “common rule book” for trade of goods with the EU. It would not use such a rule book on services, which represent the majority of trade with the EU, according to the BBC. 
British citizens and businesses would no longer be able to bring cases to the European Court of Justice, and the court would not be able to rule on British cases.
The White Paper said the U.K. would stop the free movement of people from the EU to the U.K. by the end of December 2020. It said 3.5 million EU citizens currently live in the U.K., and that after December 2020, EU citizens may be allowed to enter the country without visas to do “paid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances.” It also said there could be “reciprocal” arrangements between the U.K. and the EU for limited benefits or social security for citizens of the two sides. The document also proposed EU students could be allowed to study in Britain.
The White Paper provides details on a proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement, under which the U.K. could collect some EU tariffs on goods. The European Court of Justice would be the “interpreter of EU rules,” such as the rules on trade. 
Responses to the White Paper
Dominic Raab, the newly appointed Brexit Secretary after David Davis resigned from the role on Sunday, said the White Paper was a proposal for a ""principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the U.K. and the EU.”
Prime Minister Theresa May said the proposal “absolutely delivers on the Brexit we voted for.” She added that the British people “voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders. That is exactly what we will do.""
Conservative party member of parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg said, ""There are very few signs of the prime minister's famous red lines. It is a pale imitation of the paper prepared by David Davis, a bad deal for Britain. It is not something I would vote for, nor is it what the British people voted for.""
Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he had ""deep misgivings"" about the White Paper. He added, ""I voted to leave not to half leave.”
The EU’s lead negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc would analyze the White Paper and was “looking forward” to negotiations with the U.K. next week.
The European Parliament’s lead Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said, ""We will analyze the White Paper in light of our priorities: citizens' rights, an operational backstop for Ireland and a deep economic relationship based on the integrity of the Union and internal market.""

39308,2018-07-14,"Trump meets Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister May during UK visit","President Donald Trump met with Britain’s Queen Elizabeth for the first time in an official capacity on Friday evening, after arriving in the U.K. on Thursday for a four day state visit. When Trump arrived in the country, he was met by Prime Minister Theresa May at a welcome ceremony, and later met with U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Woody Johnson. Protests against Trump’s visit were held in London on Friday. 
On Friday, Trump met with May and other U.K. leaders for bilateral talks and a working lunch at Chequers, at which they discussed economic cooperation and a potential free trade deal for after the U.K. leaves the European Union. May said the two countries agreed “to pursue an ambitious deal” on free trade, using as a platform the “Chequers agreement,” which outlined the U.K.’s “vision for a relationship” with the EU after it leaves the union. The U.K. Cabinet agreed to the priorities, which included a “common rulebook” for goods regulations and the elimination of the need for customs; some ministers resigned over the agreement. 
The U.S. and U.K. would reach a trade deal that “works for both countries right across our economies, a deal that builds on the UK’s independent trade policy, reducing tariffs; delivering a gold standard in financial services cooperation; and, as two of the world’s most advanced economies, seizing the opportunity of new technology,” May said. 
On Thursday, British tabloid outlet The Sun published an interview with Trump in which he said May did not listen to his advice for how to exit the EU. “If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the U.K., so it will probably kill the deal,” Trump said about May’s Chequers agreement. The president also said in the interview that he thought Boris Johnson, who recently resigned as the foreign secretary, “would be a great prime minister.""
On Friday, Trump said he had made the comments after reading “some reports” that the U.K. would not be able to make a free trade agreement with the U.S. if it went forward with the Chequers agreement. “I believe after speaking with the prime minister's people that [a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement] will absolutely be possible,"" Trump said. ""The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the UK and the UK wants to trade with us."" 
Trump also said he apologized to May for the interview, saying The Sun left out all the positive comments he had made about the prime minister and calling the outlet “fake news.” He called May a “total professional,” and said the U.S.-U.K. relationship is “the highest grade of special.”
While the U.K. and U.S. leaders were working on Friday, May’s husband, Philip May hosted Melania Trump at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a home for retired soldiers. The first lady met with school children and retired soldiers, toured the chapel on the grounds, spoke about her “Be Best” initiative and played a game of lawn bowling.
On Friday evening, Trump and the first lady were received by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. After inspecting the Honor Guard, the Trumps had tea with the queen. This was the first time during his administration that Trump has met Queen Elizabeth. Trump called the queen an “incredible woman.”
Over the course of Trump’s four day visit, 60 protests against his visit were scheduled, The Hill reported. On Friday, a demonstration in London was attended by an estimated 250,000 people, according to “Stop Trump” organizers. During that protest, a “Trump baby” blimp was flown above Parliament Square, held by protesters wearing red hats that said “Trump babysitter.”
The president and first lady are scheduled to spend the weekend in Scotland. They will travel to Helsinki, Finland next week for the president’s planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

39302,2018-07-14,"130 killed, 150 wounded in 2 separate attacks in Pakistan","More than 130 people were killed and more than 150 wounded in two separate bomb attacks in Pakistan on Friday. The attacks took place at separate rallies for different political parties, ahead of general elections later this month. No group has claimed responsibility for either attack.
One of the attacks, a suicide bombing in the town of Dringarh in southwest Pakistan, was at a rally for the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), according to provincial home minister Agha Omar Bangulzai. It killed at least 128 people and wounded 150 others, BBC reported. 
The second attack took place in the town of Bannu in the country’s northwest, after a rally for the Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam (JUI-F) political party. A remote improvised explosive device was detonated, killing four and injuring 19, according to Al Jazeera. 
On Tuesday this week, a suicide bomb attack at a campaign gathering in the city of Peshawar in northern Pakistan killed 22 people, including politician Haroon Bilour. There were also 69 wounded in the attack. The Tehreek-e-Taliban, or Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for that attack.
Pakistan’s army said more than 371,000 troops are to be deployed to ensure the July 25 general election is ""free and fair."" According to the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies research organization, more than 158 people were killed in the six weeks preceding the country’s 2013 election. 
Political rallies and demonstrations occurred elsewhere in Pakistan on Friday. In the city of Lahore, hundreds of people were detained prior to the arrival of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday, according to his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. Sharif was arrested when he arrived in Lahore by plane from the U.K. i and was taken into custody by officials from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). 
Last week, Sharif was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $10.6 million for owning assets beyond his income level and for non-cooperation with the NAB. Prior to Sharif’s arrival, thousands of police officers were deployed in the city, shipping containers were placed on some roads to block access to the airport, and officials put the city on lockdown, BBC reported.

39477,2018-07-16,Israel shows reporters documents allegedly stolen from Iran,"On Sunday, The New York Times reported that last week, Israel gave a Times reporter and two other reporters additional information about documents detailing Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons program, which Israel said it took from Tehran during a raid in January. Iran has said the documents are fraudulent. 
None of the documents Israel obtained show Iran has recently engaged in nuclear weapons development, or that the country has violated the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
According to the Times, Israel disclosed details about how the documents were removed from Iran; photographs of a testing facility for implosion devices; the presence of warhead designs within the documents; and memos that Israel says show Iranian officials made efforts to continue research for their nuclear program after international inspectors determined it had been suspended. 
In response to last week’s allegations, Alireza Miryousefi, a minister-counselor at Iran’s U.N. mission,​ said, “Iran has always been clear that creating indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is against what we stand for as a country and the notion that Iran would abandon any kind of sensitive information in some random warehouse in Tehran is laughably absurd.”
Documents removed
Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency said it observed Iranians relocating the documents to a warehouse in a commercial district in Tehran beginning in February 2016. 
According to the Times report, on Jan. 31 of this year, fewer than 24 Mossad agents broke into the warehouse at about 10:30 p.m. local time and used torches to cut through some of the 32 safes within. Overall, the agents removed 50,000 pages and 183 compact discs of memos, videos and plans from the warehouse. The agents had orders to leave by 5 a.m., and Iranian guards discovered the break-in at 7 a.m. 
Testing facility
Reporters were shown photos of a cylindrical test chamber in a building at Parchin military base. The chamber was allegedly used to conduct tests on implosion devices that could be used to trigger a nuclear bomb. The facility had been refurbished and the chamber was not there when the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano, visited the site in 2015. 
Warhead designs
One Israeli intelligence official said, “we see explicit material related to nuclear weapons from different sources, some of it not Iranian in origin.” Israel did not show the designs to reporters. 
Memos
Within the documents is a memo, allegedly from an Iranian official, dated Sept. 3, 2003, that says, “Let there be no mistake: the amount of personnel in the overt and covert parts will not decrease,” and “the structure will not become smaller, and every sub-project will supervise both its overt and covert parts.”
The end of Iran’s nuclear program, named “Project Amad,” was declared in 2003, according to the Times. 
The document collection also contains notes from the late Masoud Ali Mohammadi, a nuclear physicist at the University of Tehran, that read,“‘Neutrons’ research could not be considered ‘overt’ and needs to be concealed.” He also wrote, “we cannot excuse such activities as defensive. Neutron activities are sensitive, and we have no explanation for them.” Mohammadi was assassinated in January 2010.
The JCPOA
In 2015, the Iran nuclear agreement or JCPOA was reached between Iran, the U.S., Russia, China, the U.K., France, Germany and the EU. 
On April 30 of this year, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the documents from the Tehran warehouse showed Iran “intensified” efforts to hide “nuclear weapons files” after signing the 2015 agreement. On May 8, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the JCPOA and reimpose sanctions on Iran. 
On July 6, ministers from the U.K, China, France, Germany and Russia met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Vienna to negotiate new terms to the JCPOA that would compensate for the resumption of U.S. sanctions in August.

39475,2018-07-16,"Haiti’s PM, cabinet resign after fuel price protests","On Saturday, Haiti’s prime minister and the members of his cabinet resigned after riots over fuel price increases, during which seven people were killed. On July 6, Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant’s government announced that the following day prices would increase 38 percent for gasoline, 47 percent for diesel and 51 percent for kerosene. After the announcement, protesters incurred other damages, including blocked roads, looting and vandalism, according to NPR. Lafontant suspended the price increases on July 7. 
Haiti subsidizes the cost of fuel. It removed the subsidies as part of an agreement earlier this year with the International Monetary Fund. With the deal, Haiti will gain access to $96 million in loans and grants, the Miami Herald reported.
According to the World Bank, 59 percent of Haitians earn less than $2.41 per day. The country spends 2.2 percent of its GDP on subsidies, according to a 2014 World Bank report, and the wealthiest 20 percent of Haitians receive 93 percent of the subsidies.
Lafontant became prime minister in 2017. Haitian President Jovenel Moïse said on a television broadcast that he will choose a new prime minister to form a government “whose mission will be to alleviate the misery of the Haitian people.”

39468,2018-07-16,"New York Times reports on Uber COO’s comments on women, minorities","On Friday, The New York Times reported on comments made by Barney Harford, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the ride-hailing company Uber, that were allegedly “insensitive” to race and gender. Harford said, “I have been embarrassed to learn that at times I made comments that made people feel uncomfortable, isolated, or unwelcome. Certainly that was not my intent, but I make no excuses for my behavior. To those of you who I hurt with careless words, I’m sorry.”
Five anonymous “people familiar with the conversation” alleged that in a meeting, Harford spoke about a potential video advertisement for the company, commenting aloud “how common the pairing was among the audiences that would see it,” the Times reported. He also allegedly said he could not tell the difference between two black women who had the same hairstyles in one version of the ad. Harford later told coworkers he regretted the phrasing he used.
Also, two Uber employees said Harford, 46, made comments at a Women of Uber internal group meeting, where he was the group’s sponsor. Some thought the comments were “insensitive” toward women. Harford also allegedly made comments at a meeting with a team that oversees Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Some felt those comments were “insensitive” and some became upset, according to the two Uber employees who spoke to the Times.
Since the alleged video advertisement incident, multiple Uber employees have filed complaints about Harford’s behavior with Uber’s human resources department, the head of diversity and with other executives, the Times reported. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was informed of some complaints and addressed them directly with Harford. Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia CEO, hired Harford last December. The two had previously worked together at Expedia. 
In a memo to staff on Friday, Harford mentioned the forthcoming “painful story” from the Times and said, ""You have my commitment that I will do everything necessary to create a truly inclusive environment. I will be working directly” with Khosrowshahi and others “to ensure that I have a plan that will enable me to become a better leader to all of our colleagues. I am committed to working with a coach who will challenge me to confront my blind spots. And, most importantly, I will seek out opportunities to build the best, highest performing, and most diverse business leadership team.”
Khosrowshahi, who was named Uber’s CEO in August after the company’s former CEO Travis Kalanick resigned last June, said, “Cultures are not built or rebuilt overnight. People learn, companies learn, CEOs learn. It’s a process of constant self-reflection and improvement, and it takes work to make real change.” He added,  “I am committed to doing more and doing better as we build a culture where everyone feels they belong, are (sic) challenged but respected, and can grow and succeed. We’ll make mistakes along the way, but one thing is certain: We will improve, substantially.”
Other recent Uber news
On July 9, Uber’s Chief Legal Officer Tony West tweeted that the company had hired what CNN reported was the company’s first-ever chief compliance and ethics officer.
On July 10, Uber's HR head, Liane Hornsey, resigned without stating a reason, according to related emails Reuters reported from her to her employees, and from Khosrowshahi to employees. Reuters noted she had not responded to a request for comment the previous day related to an investigation into her handling of racial discrimination allegations at the company. Uber said it was “confident” that the investigation had been conducted in an “unbiased, thorough and credible manner, and that the conclusions of the investigation were addressed appropriately.” Hornsey had been HR head for about 18 months, according to Reuters.
On Friday, Uber said it was in the process of implementing a system to notify the company in real time when one of its drivers was charged with a crime. It said it had dismissed 25 drivers since it started using the system this month. The system was a result of Uber working with Appriss, a company that obtains local government data on arrests, and Checkr, the company that Uber uses for background checks. 
“Safety is essential to Uber and we want to ensure drivers continue to meet our standards on an ongoing basis,"" said Gus Fuldner, vice president of safety and insurance at Uber. He added, ""This new continuous checking technology will strengthen our screening process and improve safety.""

39550,2018-07-17,"Putin denies interfering in US election, Trump denies collusion after summit","Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in a joint press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday following a one-on-one meeting in Helsinki. Trump said there was “no collusion at all,” and that he ran a “clean campaign” against Hillary Clinton. He also said Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian election interference and the possibility that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia has had a ""negative impact"" on bilateral relations. 
Trump said Putin was “incredibly strong and powerful” in denying election interference. Putin “just said it’s not Russia,” Trump said. “I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” He also said he had “great confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies. 
Last year, the CIA and FBI assessed with “high confidence” that Putin ordered an “influence campaign” into the 2016 election, and NSA assessed it with “moderate confidence.” 
Putin said at the conference the U.S. could ask Russia, under a 1999 agreement, to interrogate 12 Russian military officers who were indicted in the U.S. last week for allegedly hacking into the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen emails. He said the U.S. could request to be present at the interrogation. He was responding to a question about whether Russia would extradite the officers to the U.S. 
Putin said Russia would expect the U.S. to cooperate similarly in a Russian investigation of an American-British investor, William Browder, who is in the U.S. and is accused of financial crimes in Russia. Browder had lobbied for U.S. legislation that sanctioned Russian officials suspected of human rights abuses, following the death of Browder’s lawyer.  
Trump said it was an “incredible offer” to allow the countries’ intelligence forces to work together on the investigation into alleged cyber attacks. 
Putin, when asked, said he favored Trump in the election. “Yes, I wanted him to win because he spoke of normalization of Russian-U.S. ties,” Putin said. Putin also called the allegation that he had compromising information collected on Trump “sheer nonsense,” and had not known Trump was in Moscow prior to the election. “Do you really believe that we try to shadow every businessman?” asked the president, a former KGB member.  
On Tuesday, Trump told reporters at the White House, “I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place,” adding, it “could be other people also. A lot of people out there.” 
“I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia,” Trump said Tuesday, saying his comment needed some ""clarification."" He said he initially intended to say ""wouldn't"" instead of ""would,"" and hoped that would be ""obvious."" He added, ""We are doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.""
Other topics discussed
At Monday's press conference, Putin said Trump’s efforts toward North Korean denuclearization were “good,” and attributed it to Trump personally becoming “involved in the resolution, building dialogue in the spirit of cooperation, not confrontation.”
The leaders also said they are examining ways to protect Israel from conflict along its Syrian border, without stating any specific measures. In the Syrian war, Russia supports Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, the U.S. has supported certain rebel groups, and both countries have fought the Islamic State. 
“We also discussed at length the crisis in Syria,” Trump said. “Cooperation between our countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives.” 
Trump called Putin a “competitor,” which he said was a “compliment,” and mentioned that the U.S. and Russia compete in the energy market. 
At the press conference, Trump did not mention the topic of the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Putin said Trump’s position on the topic was “well-known,” and that “as far as we, the Russian Federation, are concerned, this issue is off the table.”
Trump and Putin’s comments were made at a press conference after a summit in Finland’s capital city, attended only by Putin, Trump and translators. The meeting was originally scheduled for 90 minutes, according to the White House, and lasted more than two hours. 
Prior to the meeting, Trump thanked his Finnish counterpart, President Sauli Niinistö, for hosting the summit and for his commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO members met in Brussels last week and committed to “improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of alliance membership.”
The U.S. president left Helsinki on Monday evening local time, and is scheduled to visit Joint Base Andrews, an air base in Maryland, before returning to Washington.
Response to the meeting
Following the Putin-Trump news conference, U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Trump “must appreciate that Russia is not our ally.” The Speaker added, “There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world.” Ryan, in his role in the House, has attended briefings by U.S. intelligence personnel on the alleged interference.  
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the bilateral talks went “better than super,” Russian media reported.

39583,2018-07-17,US judge orders temporary pause on deportations of reunited migrant families,"On Monday, a U.S. federal judge ordered the government to temporarily pause any deportations of migrant families reunited after being separated as a result of the Trump administration’s previous “zero-tolerance policy” on immigration. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), representing migrants in a class-action suit, had requested the delays citing “rumors” of “mass deportations.” 
District Court Judge Dana Sabraw ordered a one week temporary delay on deportations until the Department of Justice (DOJ) could file a response. DOJ attorneys oppose stopping deportations, The Associated Press reported.  
The ACLU said in a court filing that there are “persistent and increasing rumors” that “mass deportations may be carried out imminently and immediately upon reunification,” and requested a one week stay between reunification and deportation. The organization said parents who would be deported need time to decide whether to leave their children in the U.S. to seek asylum. 
This decision “cannot be made until parents not only have had time to fully discuss the ramifications with their children, but also to hear from the child’s advocate or counsel,” the ACLU said. The advocate “can explain to the parent the likelihood of the child ultimately prevailing in his or her own asylum case if left behind in the U.S. (as well as where the child is likely to end up living).” 
In June, Sabraw ordered families to be reunited by July 5 and July 24, for minors under five years of age and those over five years, respectively. The DOJ and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said they would not be able to make the deadline due to logistical issues and requested an extension, which the court denied on July 6.
The Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” announced in April resulted in adults and minors being separated because the policy called for all adults found illegally crossing the border to be charged with federal crimes for illegal entry or attempted entry. Under federal law, minors cannot be held in adult criminal detention centers, so children were separated from the adults accompanying them. During the zero-tolerance policy, “under 3,000” children were separated from their parents who illegally entered the U.S., according to the HHS. 
On June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end the practice of separating children and to, instead, detain families together when deemed “appropriate.” The order directed the DOJ to file a request with a federal court to modify the “Flores settlement,”  which in accordance with a 2016 court ruling prohibited immigrant accompanied and unaccompanied children from being detained for more than 20 days. The executive order directed the DOJ to request this time be extended, so that immigrant families could be detained together while waiting for immigration proceedings. On July 10, a federal court ruled against increasing the time limit.

39596,2018-07-17,UN secretary general calls deaths of 275 Nicaraguan protesters ‘unacceptable’,"On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the recent deaths of protesters in Nicaragua and the “lethal use of force by entities tied to the state” was “unacceptable.” Twelve people were killed over the weekend, Reuters reported, and the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights reported that 275 people have died in protests against President Daniel Ortega since April. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) alleged that armed groups and police have used “excessive and arbitrary force” against the student protesters.
“It’s essential to immediately halt the violence and rebuild national political dialogue,” Guterres said at the 40th anniversary event of the IACHR. “Only a political solution is acceptable.” 
Protests began April 18 when the government announced it would reduce public pension benefits. While the government withdrew the plan, general demonstrations against the government continued. The opposition has called for Ortega to step down and call elections.
The Nicaraguan president says he is open to dialogue and to having the IACHR verify that human rights have been respected in the country.
On Monday, the U.S. State Department said in a statement that Ortega’s government should hold elections. Earlier this month, the U.S. government issued a Level 3 travel advisory for travelers to “reconsider” visiting the country, ordered non-emergency U.S. government personnel to depart Nicaragua, and imposed sanctions on three individuals “for being responsible for, or the leaders of entities involved in, serious human rights abuse in Nicaragua.”

39594,2018-07-17,23 injured from volcanic debris while touring Hawaii lava flow into ocean,"On Monday in Hawaii, 23 people were injured when debris from the erupting Kilauea volcano hit the roof of their tour boat, damaging the vessel’s roof and railing. Thirteen people were treated at Hilo Medical Center hospital, one in serious condition with a fractured femur, and ten others were treated on sight at Wailoa Harbor for superficial injuries. 
The Hawaii Lava Boat Tours vessel departed Wailoa Sampan Basin Harbor, near Hilo on the Big Island, at 4 a.m. It returned at about 7 a.m. after being struck by the “lava bomb,” or semi-molten volcanic rock material expelled from a volcanic vent. 
Shane Turpin, owner and captain of the boat, said he brought the boat about 250 yards (230 meters) from where the lava is entering the ocean. He said the boat was leaving the area when “all of a sudden everything around us exploded” with no warning. 
The Kilauea volcano began erupting on May 3 and was still erupting as of Sunday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The agency said on Friday that lava created a new land mass, or “tiny new island,” off the coastline with a diameter of approximately 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 meters). On Monday, the agency said new lava connected the “island” with Hawaii’s Big Island.

39671,2018-07-18,Goldman Sachs names David Solomon as next CEO,"Goldman Sachs on Tuesday named David Solomon as the company’s next chief executive officer. Solomon will take over from current CEO Lloyd Blankfein on Oct. 1. Blankfein plans to retire as CEO on Sept. 30, and from his role as Chairman of the Board at the end of year.
Solomon “is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs,” Blankfein said in the company’s press release. “He has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy. Through the talent of our people and the quality of our client franchise, Goldman Sachs is poised to realize the next stage of growth.”
Solomon, 56, joined the company in 1999 after leaving Bear Stearns. He was promoted to head the company’s investment banking division in July 2006. The division saw a 70 percent increase in sales under Solomon’s management, CNN reported.
He was promoted to co-president and co-chief operating officer in 2016. He shared the titles with Harvey Schwartz until Schwartz left the company in March 2018.
Solomon also produces dance music under the moniker “DJ D-Sol.”
Blankfein
Blankfein, 63, started his career in finance as a commodities trader at J Aron  Co, which was bought by Goldman Sachs in 1981. He was promoted to president in 2004 and to chief executive and chairman in 2006 before the economic recession between 2007 and 2009. Blankfein managed Goldman Sachs for 12 years.
“Today, I don’t want to retire from Goldman Sachs, but by my own perhaps convoluted logic, it feels like the right time,” Blankfein said in an internal statement. “It’s always been hard for me to imagine leaving. When times are tougher, you can’t leave. And, when times are better, you don’t want to leave.”
Guy Moszkowski, analyst at financial research firm Autonomous, said Blankfein led Goldman Sachs “effectively through the industry collapse of 2008 in arguably far, far better shape than most of the peer group.”
Goldman Sachs
Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is an investment banking and management firm that provides financial services to corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. The company, which went public in 1999, is headquartered in New York and has offices in “all major financial centers around the world,” according to the company website. 
In 2016, the company entered the consumer banking market with the launch of an online banking system called “Marcus.”
According to CNN, the company’s trading profit accounts for one-third of its revenue, down from half of its revenue in 2012. Goldman Sachs announced a $5 billion revenue growth plan last year that proposed increasing its online consumer lending business and other revenue streams by 2020.

39668,2018-07-18,Cuba begins offering internet access to mobile phones,"Cuba has started to provide internet on mobile phone devices to select users, and plans to provide such services nationwide by the end of 2018. Journalists at state-run news outlets were some of the first people to gain access to mobile internet services through state-owned telecommunications company ETECSA, Reuters reported.
Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel has promoted the service as a means to increase the country’s economic growth, as well as promote the communist revolution. “We need to be able to put the content of the revolution online,” he told parliament last year, adding it would “counter” the “banal and vulgar content.”
Journalist Yuris Nórido, 39, who works for a state-run news outlets said, “I can now get an update on the news from wherever I am, including where the news is taking place.”
According to Reuters, certain employees at businesses and embassies have had mobile internet access since December, but ETECSA plans to broaden its availability to all 5 million of its mobile phone customers by the end of this year. Cuba’s total population is about 11.5 million.
ETECSA also plans to expand internet access to Cuban homes. ETECSA President Mayra Arevich announced in December that it had connected about 11,000 homes last year. Reuters reported that the Cuban government had a goal to connect at least half of homes and 60 percent of mobile phones by 2020; it did not report the current percentage of connected homes compared to non-connected homes.
Last month, ETECSA launched a free proprietary messaging application for Cuban residents called Todus.
ETECSA charges companies and embassies $45 a month for four gigabytes of data, and mobile hotspots cost $1 an hour. The average worker in Cuba earns $30 per month, according to Reuters. Cubans can currently use two sites for free: the ETECSA portal mi.cubacel.net, and portal.nauta.cu. 
Prior to 2013, the internet was mostly only available in tourist hotels, Reuters reported.

39666,2018-07-18,4 US states file lawsuit against 2017 federal tax law,"New York, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the federal government over the 2017 tax reform law, which limits federal deductions for state and local taxes. The lawsuit claims the deduction cap would cause “significant and disproportionate injury to the plaintiff states and their residents.” The Treasury Department said it is reviewing the complaint. 
The 2017 law limited the amount that taxpayers could deduct for state and local taxes, called SALT. Prior to the law, SALT deductions had no limit. The deduction is now limited to $10,000 for federal returns, regardless of the state. Deductions help reduce the amount of taxes owed to the government.
The lawsuit claims New York taxpayers could pay an additional $14.3 billion in taxes for 2018 and up to $121 billion through 2025. The lawsuit noted that other plaintiff states “will experience similar effects” as a result of the maximum. In New York, residents claimed an average of $22,169 in SALT deductions in 2015, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
According to figures from the non-profit Tax Foundation, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey hold the top three spots for the most expensive state and local tax burdens per capita as a percentage of income, using 2012 figures. Maryland is the seventh most expensive by that measure, according to the figures. The four states are within the top nine for most state and local taxes collected per capita (not as a percentage of income) in 2015, according to the Tax Foundation. 
Average SALT deduction claims on federal taxes exceeded $10,000 in 19 states plus D.C., according to Pew Trust figures for 2015. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were three of the top four states for per-claimant averages, with Maryland in the eighth spot, Pew reported.     
New York State Attorney General Barbara Underwood said the tax law deliberately targeted her state and “similar states” in order to “coerce” them “into changing our fiscal policies and the vital programs they support.”
The lawsuit claims the deduction limit could decrease home values by increasing the cost of owning a home, and thereby affect homeowners’ equity. Increased federal taxes could limit spending on goods and services, which in turn could lead to decreased business sales, the lawsuit claims. The SALT limit could also reduce state revenue used to pay for services such as schools, hospitals, police, road and bridge construction and maintenance, the lawsuit claims. It argues the limit would interfere with the state’s “sovereign authority.”
The lawsuit challenges the legality of the federal tax legislation on three constitutional grounds, claiming the SALT limit violates: the Tenth Amendment (states’ rights), the Sixteenth Amendment (federal power to tax incomes), and Article I, Section 8 (Congress’ power to tax). 
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Defendants include the Treasury Department, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Internal Revenue Service.

39663,2018-07-18,Israel suspends fuel deliveries through Gaza Strip crossing,"Israel announced temporary restrictions on its cargo crossing with the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, in response to what Israel called “continued terror attempts” by the Palestinian group Hamas. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel would suspend gas and fuel deliveries through the Kerem Shalom crossing until Sunday. Commercial cargo was suspended from delivery through the crossing last week, while food and medication is still permitted to cross.
Israel said Hamas, an Islamic political organization with an armed division that governs the Gaza territories, continues to send “incendiary kites and balloons” across the border. Israel, which considers Hamas a “terrorist” organization, estimated that about 2,500 acres of nature reserves and parks near Gaza have been burned or damaged by the incendiary devices.
Lieberman said Israel would also increase its naval blockade on Gaza. Palestinians would be restricted from sailing beyond three nautical miles off Gaza’s coast, down from the previous blockade of six nautical miles. Israel says the naval blockade is needed to protect its citizens from weapon smuggling.
On Saturday, Hamas allegedly launched several rockets toward Israel, with one reportedly injuring four Israelis when it landed on a residential home in Sderot, a city in western Israel. The Israeli army responded with airstrikes across Gaza that killed at least two Palestinians and injured 14 others.
Israel and Egypt have maintained a partial air, land and sea blockade on Gaza since the 1990s, and strengthened it in 2007, in response to Hamas’ alleged militant actions against Israel, according to the U.N.

39759,2018-07-19,"MGM sues victims, others to avoid liability for Las Vegas shooting; Twitter users call for boycott","Twitter users called for a boycott of MGM Resorts International, which owns Las Vegas’ Mandalay Bay hotel, and associated businesses on Tuesday. Last Friday, MGM filed a lawsuit in Nevada and California against more than 1,000 people whom it said had sued the company or given notice they intended to do so over last October’s Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people and wounded more than 500. The suit requested that a federal court rule that MGM cannot be held liable for the shooting.
On Oct. 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock shot from the 32nd floor of MGM’s Mandalay Bay hotel into a crowd at an outdoor country music festival below.
Certain victims have brought lawsuits against MGM for what they allege was inadequate security, which allowed Paddock to bring multiple suitcases with rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition into his hotel room, The New York Times reported.
A security company that MGM hired for the country music festival, Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC), had certain protection from liability in acts of terrorism, as granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the federal SAFETY Act. MGM argued in its lawsuit that the shooting qualified as an “act of terrorism.” 
Congress passed the SAFETY Act, formally called the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act, more than a year after 9/11 to avoid the “threat of liability” of manufacturers and sellers of “anti-terrorism technologies.” Such technologies include detections systems, sensors and security services. 
Prior to the Act, a company could be held responsible for damages if that company’s technology was “impacted by an act of terrorism,” according to DHS, which said this made the private sector “extremely reluctant to deploy security technologies and services in civilian settings.” By limiting liabilities, the Act sought to promote the development, commercialization, and deployment of such technologies. 
DHS has approved more than 800 applications for SAFETY Act liability protections, including some by National Football League and Major League Baseball stadiums, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
MGM lawyer Michael Doyen said “there has apparently never been any litigation” in which the SAFETY Act was invoked in its arguments. He said the Las Vegas shooting “appears to have been the first act of mass violence at an event at which a DHS-certified service or technology was employed.” 
DHS has not officially declared the shooting an “act of terrorism.”
Craig Eiland, an attorney for hundreds of the shooting victims, said, “CSC had nothing to do with Mandalay Bay not having security stop Stephen Paddock from unloading luggage with 23 assault rifles, carrying them up to his room and not noticing anything for three to five days.” He added that the lawsuit is about “immunizing” MGM from liability and “staying out of state courts.”
MGM spokeswoman, Debra DeShong, said, “The federal court is an appropriate venue for these cases and provides those affected with the opportunity for a timely resolution. Years of drawn-out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims, the community and those still healing.”
“Congress provided that the federal courts were the correct place for such litigation relating to incidents of mass violence like this one, where security services approved by the Department of Homeland Security were provided,” Deshrong said.

39761,2018-07-19,"Alleged Russian spy Maria Butina pleads not guilty, denied bond","A woman accused of being a Russian spy, Maria Butina, pleaded not guilty at a detention hearing on Wednesday. Butina, 29, is charged with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian government. The judge ordered her held without bond. Prosecutors argued that she was a flight risk since she is a Russian citizen with “no meaningful ties” to the U.S. Her lawyer said she had been cooperating with federal investigators before her arrest and had not attempted to flee.
Butina was arrested Sunday. Court documents said she allegedly “gained access” to ""an extensive network of U.S. persons in positions to influence political activities in the United States"" through her relationship with a 56-year-old unnamed “U.S. Person 1” with whom she lived.
“Butina appears to treat [the relationship with U.S. Person 1] as simply a necessary aspect of her activities,"" according to prosecutors. They said, “in papers seized by the FBI, Butina complained about living with U.S. Person 1 and expressed disdain for continuing to cohabitate with U.S. Person 1."" Prosecutors added, “on at least one occasion, Butina offered an individual other than U.S. Person 1 sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization.”
According to the FBI, Butina attempted to establish relationships with a “gun rights organization.” The FBI did not name the organization; NBC News reported that a “senior U.S. official” confirmed it was the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA did not respond to NBC News’ requests for comment.
Prosecutors also said Butina had communicated repeatedly with a Russian official, whom NBC News said sources identified as politician and banker Aleksandr Torshin. Torshin allegedly wrote to Butina in March 2017 that given news coverage of her as a guns rights activist, she had “upstaged” Anna Chapman. Chapman was “one member of a ring of Russian covert agents who were arrested in 2010,” according to prosecutors.
Butina also allegedly had the contact information of “individuals identified as employees of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB),” a Russian intelligence organization, according to prosecutors. “Based on this and other evidence, the FBI believes that the defendant was likely in contact with the FSB throughout her stay in the United States,” prosecutors wrote.
Butina’s lawyer, Robert Driscoll, said, “My client is famous in Russia.” He was referring to Butina being a “pro-gun figure” in Russia, according to Fox News. He said, “There is simply no indication of Ms. Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law,” or the U.S. itself. He also said Butina had been cooperating with the government, including appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee and allowing the FBI to search her apartment in April. He added, “she’s been aware of a criminal investigation into her conduct for months and made no effort or attempt to flee.”
Prosecutors wrote in their request for a bond denial, “Her last tie to the District of Columbia—her apartment lease—ends on July 31, 2018, and there were boxes packed in her apartment consistent with a move at the time of her arrest.”
Butina entered the U.S. in 2016 on a graduate student visa, and was a student in international relations at American University in Washington, D.C. She attended President Donald Trump’s inauguration with Paul Erickson, a Republican “activist,” according to Fox News.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, related Butina’s arrest to Monday’s Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki. She said, ""It seems that somebody just got out a calculator and a watch to figure out when this decision about the arrest of Maria Butina should be taken, in order to do everything possible to derail the outcome of the summit that was held with the Russia and American presidents.” She added, ""Everything was done to coincide with this.""

39757,2018-07-19,Trump says he agrees with US intel on alleged interference (Update),"President Donald Trump told CBS News on Wednesday that he agrees with U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that he would hold Putin personally responsible for it “because he’s in charge of the country.” Trump said that at their Monday Helsinki meeting, he told Putin in “very strong” terms that “we can’t have meddling,” and that he “let him know we can’t have this [interference], we’re not going to have it, and that’s the way it’s going to be.”
During the CBS News interview, Trump also said, “I don't want to get into whether or not [Putin’s] lying. I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted… I think we have excellent people in the agencies. And when they tell me something, it means a lot.“
At the end of a Cabinet meeting earlier in the day, a reporter asked Trump, “Is Russia still targeting the U.S., Mr. President?” Trump responded with, “Thank you very much. No.” The reporter later asked, “But can you just clarify, you don’t believe that to be the case?” Trump then spoke about how the U.S. was “doing” with Russia, without giving a “yes” or “no” answer to the reporter. Trump said again, “Thank you very much,” and media was asked to leave.
During a press briefing later on Wednesday, a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders about the exchange. Sanders responded by saying that Trump “said, ‘No,’ I’m not answering any more questions. And even further, I think even [the reporter] didn’t realize what the answer was because she asked for clarification and he didn’t answer the follow-up.” Sanders also said, “I talked to the president. He wasn’t answering that question. He was saying, no, he’s not taking questions.”
On Tuesday, Trump said he had “full faith and support for America’s great intelligence agencies. Always have.” He added, “I accept our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also; there’s a lot of people out there.”
Trump also said that after reviewing the transcripts there was “need for some clarification” of his statements after his meeting with Putin on Monday. Trump said on Monday at a press conference in Helsinki, “My people came to me — [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coats came to me and some others — they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” 
On Tuesday, Trump said, “I thought it would be obvious, but I would like to clarify just in case it wasn’t … In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t.’” He said, “the sentence should have been: I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia.”
Also on Tuesday, the White House released a Fact Sheet titled, “President Donald J. Trump is Protecting Our Elections and Standing Up to Russia’s Malign Activities.” The fact sheet gave examples of steps the Trump administration has taken to improve election security, and mentioned its expulsion of Russian diplomats, sanctioning of Russian entities and individuals, and “confronting” of Russian “aggression,” including the provision of “billions” of dollars to increase U.S. troop readiness in Europe.
Other comments by Trump and Sanders
At Monday’s post-meeting press conference in Helsinki, Putin said the U.S. could ask Russia to interrogate, with U.S. officials present, 12 Russian military officers who were indicted in the U.S. last week for allegedly hacking into the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, and releasing stolen emails. Putin said Russia would expect the U.S. to cooperate similarly in a Russian investigation of an American-British investor, William Browder, who is in the U.S. and is accused of financial crimes in Russia. Browder had lobbied for U.S. legislation that sanctioned Russian officials suspected of human rights abuses, following the death of Browder’s lawyer.  
At the press conference, Trump said it was an “incredible offer” to allow the countries’ intelligence forces to work together on the investigation into alleged cyber attacks.
On Wednesday, a reporter asked Sanders, “Russian authorities yesterday named several Americans who they want to question, who they claim were involved in Bill Browder’s ‘crimes,’ in their terms, including a former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul. Does President Trump support that idea? Is he open to having U.S. officials questioned by Russia?” Sanders replied, “The President is going to meet with his team, and we’ll let you know when we have an announcement on that.”
On Thursday, Sanders added, “It is a proposal that was made in sincerity by President Putin, but President Trump disagrees with it. Hopefully President Putin will have the 12 identified Russians come to the United States to prove their innocence or guilt.”
On Thursday, Trump tweeted two back-to-back tweets, which together read: “The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear............proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. There are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can ALL be solved!”

39755,2018-07-19,European Commission fines Google $5B for breaching EU antitrust rules,"On Wednesday, the European Commission ordered Google to pay a $5 billion (4.34 billion euro) fine for breaching EU antitrust rules by imposing certain restrictions on manufacturers of Android phones. The Commission ordered the company to end its “illegal practices” within 90 days or possibly face future penalties. Google announced it would appeal the ruling, saying, “Android has created more choice for everyone, not less.”
“Since 2011, Google has imposed illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search,” the Commission said. 
The Commission said Google had imposed “three types of restrictions” on Android devices including that it:

	“required” manufacturers to pre-install its search and browser apps, Search and Chrome, “as a condition for licensing” Google Play;
	“made payments to certain large manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-installed the Google Search app on their devices”; and
	“prevented manufacturers wishing to pre-install Google apps” from selling any “smart mobile device running on alternative versions of Android that were not approved by Google (so-called ‘Android forks’).”

The Commission said the second practice above regarding payments for pre-installation of Google Search “effectively ceased” as of 2014, after the Commission “started to look into the issue” in 2013.
If Google does not end the above practices, the Commission said it could face daily fines up to 5 percent of parent-company Alphabet’s average daily global sales. Alphabet’s total global sales were $110.9 billion in 2017, Bloomberg reported. 
While the case is under appeal, Google must place the potential fine money in a holding account. If the appeal fails, the money would get disbursed to the European Union member states, according to The New York Times. The company has cash reserves of $102.9 billion, Reuters reported.
EU Commissioner for competition Margrethe Vestager tweeted, “Fine of €4,34 bn to @Google for 3 types of illegal restrictions on the use of Android. In this way it has cemented the dominance of its search engine. Denying rivals a chance to innovate and compete on the merits. It’s illegal under EU antitrust rules. @Google now has to stop it.”
Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in response to the ruling that it “rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less.” 
“So far, the Android business model has meant that we haven't had to charge phone makers for our technology, or depend on a tightly controlled distribution model,” he said.
Pichai said that in 2007, Google chose to offer Android for free to phone makers and mobile network operators and added that Google “has invested billions of dollars over the last decade to make Android what it is today.”
“Phone makers don’t have to include our services; and they’re also free to pre-install competing apps alongside ours,” Pichai said. “If you prefer other apps—or browsers, or search engines—to the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead.” He added that last year, browsers “such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, [and] UC Browser more than 500 million times.”
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), about 1.5 billion smartphones were sold in 2017.
The Commission said that a study of Google Search use on Android phones where it was pre-installed versus Windows phones where it had to be installed by the user showed that “users do not download competing apps in numbers that can offset the significant commercial advantage derived through pre-installation.”
Pichai also said the decision “ignores the fact that Android phones compete with iOS phones.” The Commission said Apple did “not sufficiently constrain” Google, and provided reasons for this, including that Apple devices “are typically priced higher than Android devices and may therefore not be accessible to a large part of the Android device user base.” About 80 percent of smartphones in Europe and worldwide run on Android, according to the Commission. 
The EU began investigating Google’s Android in 2015 after a complaint two years prior from FairSearch, CNBC reported. According to its website, FairSearch is a “group of businesses and organizations united to promote economic growth, innovation and choice across the Internet ecosystem by fostering and defending competition in online and mobile search.” At the time of FairSearch’s complaint, it included Microsoft and Nokia, according to CNBC.
Last year, the Commission fined Google $2.7 billion for “abusing its dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google's own comparison shopping service.” The Commission is also continuing to investigate a case against Google’s search advertising service, AdSense. That case involves Google placing restrictions on “the ability of certain third party websites to display search advertisements from Google's competitors,” according to the Commission.
Google is predicted to account for about a third of all worldwide mobile advertisements in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. That would give the company an estimated $40 billion in sales outside the U.S. this year, Bloomberg reported.

39904,2018-07-20,Former South Korean President Park’s sentence increased to 32 years,"A South Korean court sentenced former President Park Geun-hye to an additional eight years in prison on Friday for charges of misusing state funds and violating election laws. The Seoul Central District Court, which also ordered Park to pay a 3.3 billion won ($2.91 million) fine, acquitted her of a bribery charge. Park was previously sentenced in April to 24 years jail time on corruption charges, which her lawyers have appealed. Friday’s ruling increases her total sentence to 32 years. 
Friday’s ruling sentenced Park to six years for charges related to payments she illegally received from a national spy agency, and to two years for interfering in the process to find candidates for her then-ruling party to run in the 2016 parliamentary election. 
Park was found guilty of causing loss of state money, misappropriating funds and embezzlement related to about 3.5 billion won ($3.1 million) the National Intelligence Service (NIS) paid her office between May 2013 and September 2016. She used some of the money to maintain her private residence, pay for medical bills and other expenses, prosecutors alleged. 
Park was found not guilty on Friday of bribery charges related to the NIS payment, with the court ruling that the money was not paid for favors in return. The court said it was typical for the NIS to pay money to supplement the president’s office budget from an “untraceable special activities fund,” The Korea Herald reported. The payments were made in a fixed amount on a regular basis, which the court said was not normal for a bribe. 
Prosecutors had asked the court for a sentence of 15 years for the charges for which Park received eight years. 
Park, who maintains she is not guilty, was not in attendance at the sentencing on Friday. She has boycotted her trial hearings, alleging the case is politically motivated and the judiciary and prosecution are biased against her, BBC reported. Friday’s sentencing, as well as her previous sentencing in April, were broadcast on live television. 
Background
Park, 66, is the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, who was killed while in office in 1979. She began her political career in the 1990s and later ran for the presidency. She took office in 2013 as the country’s first female leader.
In 2016, protests called for her removal from office as she was being investigated for corruption. In December of that year, South Korea’s National Assembly voted to impeach her. Then on March 10, 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld that decision. The ruling meant Park had to leave office and lost her immunity from prosecution. Park is the first democratically elected South Korean president to be impeached.
Park was arrested on March 31, 2017, and has been in jail since then. 
South Korea elected Moon Jae-in as its new president in May of last year.
April verdict
In April of this year, Park was found guilty, sentenced to 24 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 18 billion won ($16.9 million) for 16 of the 18 charges brought against her at the time, mostly related to abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Prosecutors alleged she conspired with her friend Choi Soon-sil to influence companies, including Samsung and retail company Lotte Group, to donate to foundations controlled by Choi. 
Park was accused last year of receiving 59.2 billion won ($52.1 million) in bribes from several companies. Park was also convicted of leaking 47 confidential presidential documents to Choi, who had no political credentials. Park has known Choi since the 1970s.
Park’s lawyers have appealed her 24-year sentence, and prosecutors are asking for 30 years during the appeals process for that case. If she loses her appeal and prosecutors receive the 30 years requested, her total sentence could increase to 38 years. The Seoul High Court is scheduled to rule on the case on Aug. 24
Related cases
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said in April of last year that it had investigated 110 people regarding the alleged bribery involving Choi and Park.
Choi, in her own case, was convicted and sentenced in February to 20 years in prison.
The chairman of the Lotte Group, Shin Dong-bin, was sentenced to two years and six months.
Lee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y. Lee, a leader and heir to the Samsung Group, was originally sentenced to five years in jail last August. In February, some of his convictions were overturned and the sentence was reduced to two-and-a-half years. The court suspended his sentence for four years, and he was released from jail in the interim.

39895,2018-07-20,"17 dead, 7 injured after tourist vessel capsizes in Missouri","Seventeen people were killed and seven injured, with two in critical condition, after an amphibious tourist vessel capsized in a Missouri lake on Thursday. The Ride the Ducks boat was carrying 31 passengers on Table Rock Lake near the town of Branson, when it tipped over and began to sink at about 7 p.m. local time. A severe thunderstorm warning had been issued for Branson at 6:32 p.m. and investigators are attributing the accident to stormy weather. 
Jim Pattison Jr., president of Ripley Entertainment Inc., the tour business' parent company, said the vehicle was operated by a licensed driver on land and a captain in water. He said he didn’t know when the vessel left the dock.
The driver died and the captain survived the accident, according to Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader. The sheriff also said there were life jackets on board but it’s not known whether the operators or passengers were wearing them.
The U.S. Coast Guard said the bodies of the deceased had all been recovered. Divers have located the vessel sitting on the lakebed about 80 feet (25 meters) underwater. Authorities plan to recover it, The Associated Press reported. 
Ride the Ducks Branson said it would be closed “while we support the investigation, and to allow time to grieve for the families and the community."" This was the first accident for the company in more than 40 years of operations, according to Ripley Entertainment. 
The storm in Branson was part of the same system that caused 27 tornados in Iowa, according to ABC News and CNN.

39850,2018-07-20,Nearly 100 people in Sweden evacuate homes due to wildfires; Sweden requests international aid,"On Thursday, Swedish emergency officials said nearly 100 people had evacuated their homes since Wednesday due to wildfires in the country. In Jämtland, Västerbotten, Gävleborg and Dalarna counties, authorities advised residents to evacuate multiple villages. Swedish authorities requested international aid and, on Thursday, the Red Cross said it would begin coordinating volunteers to help with evacuations and distribution of supplies and information.
Thomas Aronsson, chief of operations for SITS, a firefighting service in Sweden, said Wednesday: “There are 80 fires right now in Sweden, and there is no helicopter company or pilot in all of Sweden that's not involved in fighting” them. He added, ""we need tankers, we need helicopters -- we don't have enough supplies.”
Italy has sent two firefighting planes, and France’s civil security service said it was sending three such planes to Sweden on Thursday. Norway, which has wildfires in its territory as well, has sent 10 helicopters to Sweden for firefighting, according to NRK, Norway’s national broadcaster.
""The last time we saw wildfires of this caliber was 12 years ago,"" a rescue officer in Jokkmokk told AFP.
Fires are also burning in Norway, Finland and northwestern Russia, according to Copernicus, the EU’s Earth observation program. For a map of fire locations as of 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday, see the Stockholm Fire Department’s Facebook post here. 
Patrik Forsgren, a member of Sweden's home guard, said ""It has been very dry this spring and summer. Last weekend, it was thunder and lightning. The lightning started three forest fires.” He said firefighters had been trying to stop a fire near Ljusdal in central Sweden since Sunday. He said the fire covered about 35 square miles (91 square kilometers).
The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute said last week, “It has been exceptionally dry and hot during May, June and early July.” The institute said there was a water shortage risk for nearly all of central and southern Sweden. On Thursday, it said there was a forest fire risk for the majority of the country. 
High temperatures in central and southern Sweden have been above 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) and are predicted to continue for about a week, with a low chance of rain, according to CNN. Temperatures are predicted to be 9 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 10 degrees Celsius) above average for this time of year.

39807,2018-07-20,Israel passes law defining itself as ‘nation-state of the Jewish people’,"On Thursday, Israel’s parliament passed a law that defines the country as a “nation-state of the Jewish people.” The law, passed by a vote of 62 to 55 with two abstentions, declares that “the development of Jewish (sic) settlement” was a “national value,” and that the state “will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “With this law we determined the founding principle of our existence.” 
The law, titled “Basic Law: Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People,” says that “Israel is the national home of the Jewish people,” and “the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.”
The law also declared that Jerusalem is the “complete and united” capital of Israel. Palestinians have called for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors; the annexation is not recognized internationally. In May, the U.S. opened an embassy in Jerusalem, after announcing in December it would move its embassy there from Tel Aviv. Palestinians protested the opening.
Composed of 11 provisions, the law makes Hebrew the national language and changes the designation of Arabic from being an official language to having “special status,” whereby it can continue to be used in Israeli institutions. The legislation says it “does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.”
A version of the bill was first introduced in 2011. Israel does not have a constitution; with the passage of the legislation, the country has 14 Basic Laws which have “constitutional status,” according to BBC. 
Response to the law
Netanyahu said, “This is a defining moment in the annals of Zionism and the history of the state of Israel.” He added, “Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, and respects the rights of all of its citizens.”
Some Arab members of parliament tore up copies of the bill and one waved a black flag in protest of the legislation.
Ayman Odeh, leader of the Arab Joint List, an alliance of four majority Arab parties, said, ""[Israel] has passed a law of Jewish supremacy and told us that we will always be second-class citizens.”
Benny Begin, son of former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin who founded Netanyahu’s Likud party, abstained from voting and said, “This is not a decision I expected from the Likud leadership.”
The American Jewish Committee said it was ""deeply disappointed,"" and that the law ""put at risk the commitment of Israel's founders to build a country that is both Jewish and democratic.""
Hassan Jabareen, general director of Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, said, ""The Jewish nation-state law features key elements of apartheid, which is not only immoral but also absolutely prohibited under international law.”
""We will keep ensuring civil rights in Israel's democracy but the majority also has rights and the majority decides,"" Netanyahu said last week. He added, “An absolute majority wants to ensure our state's Jewish character for generations to come.”
Palestinians have equal rights under the law in Israel. Some Palestinians there have said they are discriminated against and receive lesser services and allocations of education, health and housing compared to some Jews, Al Jazeera reported.
Netanyahu has said that Palestinians must recognize Israel as a Jewish state in any permanent peace settlement between the two parties. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said he will never recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Palestinians have recognized the State of Israel.
Palestinians account for about 1.8 million, or 20 percent, of the approximately nine million people in Israel, according to Al Jazeera.

39816,2018-07-20,Commerce Department begins investigation of uranium imports on national security grounds,"On Wednesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced he would begin an investigation into possible trade actions on uranium imports based on national security concerns. Ross said U.S. production of uranium for military and electric power has decreased from 49 percent of U.S. consumption to 5 percent. Ross has up to 270 days to make trade action recommendations to President Donald Trump, who would then have 90 days to decide if and how to act on the recommendations.
Ross said, “The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent review to determine whether uranium imports threaten to impair the national security.” The department said it consulted with industry stakeholders, lawmakers, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy before starting its investigation, which is to include mining, enrichment, and defense and industrial use of uranium.
Two companies, Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy, petitioned for the Commerce Department investigation in January, requesting that the U.S. implement quotas to maintain American uranium production at 25 percent of the U.S. market. The companies cited national security concerns under Section 232 of a 1962 trade law, saying, “In 2017, U.S. uranium production fell to near historic lows due in large part to uranium and nuclear fuel imported from state-subsidized foreign entities.” Ross said the decrease in U.S. uranium production from 49 to 5 percent that he quoted occurred over the last 30 years.
In 2016, the uranium suppliers to the U.S. were Canada, with 25 percent of imports; Kazakhstan with 24 percent; Australia with 20 percent; Russia with 14 percent; Uzbekistan with 4 percent; and other countries totaling 12 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Also, Russian state-run Rosatom purchased Canada’s Uranium One in 2013, which gave it control over about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, according to CNBC.
Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy are held by Canadian companies, with all operations and employees in the U.S., The Washington Post reported. The companies said together they supplied more than half of U.S.-based uranium in 2017. They laid off more than half their staff over the past two years. Ross said three U.S. companies had stopped uranium mining operations in recent years.
The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) said of the Commerce Department investigation, “We sympathize with the plight of uranium suppliers. However, NEI does not support the implementation of quotas as described in the petition. Potential remedies could put even more generating units at risk for premature closure, which would further soften the market for uranium.” Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy say U.S. uranium production this year will decrease by nearly one half.
More than half of U.S. nuclear reactors are totaling losses of $2.9 billion per year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Last month, Trump directed U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to “prepare immediate steps” to stop the loss of “fuel-secure” power facilities, which could include nuclear power and coal-fired plants. 
The majority of nuclear reactors on ships and submarines use a more enriched grade of uranium than the majority of commercial nuclear reactors, according to World Nuclear Association. A 2015 Energy Department study concluded that based on existing stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium “new sources of fuel for naval reactors will be needed in approximately 2060.”

39950,2018-07-21,An expanded timeline of Trump’s comments on Russia this week,"Monday, 11:50 a.m.*
During a joint press conference in Helsinki on Monday, Putin denied that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump said, “I think that [Mueller’s] probe is a disaster for our country … There was no collusion at all, everybody knows it.”
Trump also said, “My people came to me — [National Intelligence Director] Dan Coats came to me and some others — they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” He added, “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.” See the press conference here.
Also on Monday, Coats issued a statement saying, “The role of the Intelligence Community is to provide the best information and fact-based assessments possible for the President and policymakers. We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security.”
Monday, 3:40 p.m. 
Trump tweeted, “As I said today and many times before, ‘I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.’ However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!”
Monday, 4:29 p.m. 
Trump tweeted regarding his meeting with Putin, “I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics.”
Monday, 4:34 p.m. 
Trump tweeted, “A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world.”
Tuesday, 10:22 a.m.
Trump tweeted, “While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!”
Tuesday, 2:30 p.m.*
At a White House meeting with lawmakers, Trump said he “realized there is some need for clarification” about his remarks on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. He said he’d reviewed a transcript and video of his remarks, and that “In a key sentence in my remarks I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t …  The sentence should have been: ‘I don't see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia. Sort of a double negative.”
He added, “I have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections. Unlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts — and repel — we will stop it, we will repel it — any efforts to interfere in our elections.  We’re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.” Read a transcript of his remarks here.
Wednesday, 5:53 a.m.
Trump tweeted, “So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!”
Wednesday, 7:27 a.m.
Trump tweeted, “Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!”
Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.*
During a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump was asked by a reporter, “Mr. President, is Russia still targeting the U.S.? Is Russia still targeting the U.S., Mr. President?” Trump responded, “Thank you very much. No.” The reporter then asked, “No, you don’t believe that to be the case?” To which Trump replied, “No. Thank you very much everybody.”
The reporter finally asked, “But can you just clarify, you don’t believe that to be the case?” Trump responded, “We’re doing very well. Let me tell you, we’re doing very well. And we’re doing very well, probably as well as anybody has ever done with Russia. And there’s been no President ever as tough as I have been on Russia. All you have to do is look at the numbers. Look at what we’ve done. Look at sanctions. Look at ambassadors not there. Look, unfortunately, at what happened in Syria recently. And I think President Putin knows that better than anybody, certainly a lot better than the media. He understands it. And he’s not happy about it, and he shouldn’t be happy about it — because there’s never been a President as tough on Russia as I have been. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much.” Read a transcript of his remarks here. Watch video of his remarks here.
The reporter who asked the question tweeted later Wednesday, “Yes, [Trump] was looking directly at me when he spoke. Yes, I believe he heard me clearly.”
Wednesday, 2:45 p.m.*
Regarding Trump’s response to the reporter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “I got a chance to speak with the President after his comments, and the President was — said, ‘Thank you very much,’ and was saying ‘no’ to answering questions. The President and his administration are working very hard to make sure that Russia is unable to meddle in our elections as they have done in the past and as we have stated.”
A reporter then asked, “So he does believe it’s going on?” To which Sanders replied, “Well, since there’s currently not an election today, not specifically, but we certainly believe that we are taking steps to make sure they can’t do it again.  Unlike previous administrations, this President is actually taking bold action and reform to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But he does believe that they would target, certainly, U.S. elections again.” Read a transcript of her remarks here.
Wednesday, 5 p.m.*
In a televised interview, CBS News anchor Jeff Glor asked Trump, “You say you agree with U.S. intelligence that Russia meddled in the election in 2016.” Trump responded, “Yeah and I've said that before, Jeff. I have said that numerous times before, and I would say that is true, yeah.” Glor then asked, “But you haven't condemned Putin, specifically. Do you hold him personally responsible?” To which Trump replied, “Well I would, because he's in charge of the country. Just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country. So certainly as the leader of a country you would have to hold him responsible, yes.”
Glor then asked, “But he denies it, so if you believe US intelligence agencies, is Putin lying to you?” And Trump replied, “I don't want to get into whether or not he's lying. I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted. I think that Dan Coats is excellent, I think that [CIA Director] Gina [Haspel] is excellent. I think we have excellent people in the agencies. And when they tell me something it means a lot.”
Glor asked, “Coats says the threat is ongoing. Do you agree with that?” To which the president replied, “Well, I'd accept, I mean he's an expert. This is what he does. He's been doing a very good job. I have tremendous faith in Dan Coats. And if he says that, I would accept that. I will tell you, though, it better not be. It better not be.” Read a transcript of the interview here.
Thursday, 6:59 a.m.
Trump tweeted, “The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I’ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!”
Thursday, 7:13 a.m. 
Trump tweeted, “‘Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.’ Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.”
Thursday, 9:24 – 9:30 a.m.
Trump sent two tweets, which said, “The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media. I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear........ proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. There are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can ALL be solved!”
Thursday, 3:51 p.m. 
Sanders tweeted, “In Helsinki, @POTUS agreed to ongoing working level dialogue between the two security council staffs. President Trump asked @Ambjohnbolton to invite President Putin to Washington in the fall and those discussions are already underway.”

39901,2018-07-21,Trump signs order to develop training strategy for US workers; companies commit to train 3.8M workers over 5 years,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the National Council for the American Worker. The council will be comprised of cabinet members and administration officials who will work to develop a national strategy for training and retraining workers for “the 21st century economy and the emerging industries of the future.” 
The executive order said the Council, among other priorities, would:

	develop recommendations on how the federal government can work with private sector, unions and local governments to provide ""affordable education and skills-based training.""
	work with various agencies to consistently apply recommendations.
	develop an awareness campaign for education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
	develop a plan for ""recognizing"" companies that demonstrate ""excellence"" in training programs to develop best practices.
	make a recommendation for ""a specific course of action for increasing transparency related to education and job-training program option,"" including proposing ways to increase public access to job data.
	examine private and public expenditures for education and training (from primary school up), and suggest reforms to those expenses.

The order did not specify how any recommendations would be implemented.
As part of the job creation effort, some companies and trade groups signed a “Pledge to America’s Workers,” committing to increase apprenticeships and work-based learning, continuing education, on-the-job training, and the teaching of new skills. This includes a commitment to train 3.8 million workers over the next five years, CNN reported.
FedEx, General Motors, Home Depot, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Walmart and 16 other companies and trade organizations signed the pledge.
The executive order also created the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board to advise the new council. The board members will include the Secretary of Commerce and the Advisor to the President overseeing the Office of Economic Initiatives, and up to 25 members from outside the federal government, to be appointed by the president. Board members will have expenses covered but will be not be compensated for their work.
The board and the council are to be disbanded in two years unless they are extended by the president.
The U.S. unemployment rate was 4 percent in June and 3.8 percent in May. In comparison, its 10-year high in October 2008 was 10 percent. There are 6.7 million unfilled jobs in the U.S., according to the White House.
The U.S. currently spends $17 billion to help fund 40 job training programs over 14 agencies. The White House has a proposed plan to ""reorganize and consolidate"" the way these funds are allocated.

39906,2018-07-21,"Israeli, Palestinian forces agree to ‘calm’ after 1 Israeli soldier, 4 Hamas members killed in Gaza fighting","Israeli and Palestinian forces agreed to “return” to “calm” after an Israeli soldier and four members of the Palestinian organization Hamas were killed on Friday. After the Israeli was killed near the border fence with Gaza by a Palestinian gunman, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) responded with airstrikes and tank and artillery fire against the Hamas Islamist organization, which governs Gaza. Four Palestinians, members of Hamas, were killed by Israeli fire, according to Hamas’ military division. 

“Everyone in Gaza needs to step back from the brink,” the U.N.'s Middle East envoy, Nikolay Mladenov, tweeted on Friday. “Not next week. Not tomorrow. Right NOW! Those who want to provoke Palestinians and Israelis into another war must not succeed.”
Later on Friday, Israeli and Palestinian forces “agreed to return to the era of calm,” according to Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. He said the agreement was reached “with Egyptian and United Nations efforts.” 
Protests by tens of thousands of Palestinians, organized by Hamas along the Gaza border, began on March 30. Protesters are calling for the “right to return” for Palestinians whose ancestors lived in Israel before the May 1948 war between Israel and neighboring countries. Israel has not granted Palestinians the “right to return.”
Since the protests began, at least 130 Palestinians have died and 15,000 have been injured by Israeli forces, according to Gaza health officials. The soldier’s death on Friday was Israel’s first fatality for an active duty soldier since the protests began.
Israel has used snipers and airstrikes against Hamas. Palestinians have fired mortar and rockets against Israeli communities, and some have sent flaming kites and balloons across the border into southern Israel. The incendiary devices have reportedly burned 2,500 acres of parks and reserves. Israeli forces have also fired live ammunition and tear gas at protesters.  
The IDF said that on Friday it had “eliminated about 60 buildings and infrastructures and revoked significant military and command and control capabilities.” 
Earlier this week, Israel announced temporary restrictions on fuel cargo crossing with the Gaza Strip, in response to what Israel called “continued terror attempts” by the Palestinian group Hamas, citing the use of incendiary devices. Last week, Israel restricted other goods from entering Gaza; it is permitting food and medicine to be delivered. 
On June 13, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution saying it “deplores the use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force” by Israel against Palestinian civilians, “particularly in the Gaza strip.” The U.S. voted against the measure, which does not mention Hamas by name, with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. saying, “it does no one any good to pretend that all blame lies on one side.”

40065,2018-07-23,"Zuckerberg describes Facebook’s content removal, News Feed ranking policies","Last Wednesday, Recode published an interview in which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed Facebook’s policies for removing content from its site. He said, “The principles that we have on what we remove from the service are: If it’s going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if you’re attacking individuals, then that content shouldn’t be on the platform.” He also said content that fact checkers identified as false would be given decreased priority in the site’s News Feed to limit its distribution.
A week before the interview, Facebook confirmed it would allow Infowars to keep its page on the site, saying its page did not violate the platform’s community standards. Infowars is a media outlet run by Alex Jones that promotes conspiracy theories, such as reporting that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was possibly a hoax. Infowars had about 914,000 Facebook followers as of Sunday night. 
The interview
In the interview, journalist Kara Swisher asked Zuckerberg to make a case for and against keeping Infowars on Facebook. 
Zuckerberg responded, “There are really two core principles at play here. There’s giving people a voice, so that people can express their opinions. Then, there’s keeping the community safe, which I think is really important. We’re not gonna let people plan violence or attack each other or do bad things. Within this, those principles have real trade-offs and real tug on each other. In this case, we feel like our responsibility is to prevent hoaxes from going viral and being widely distributed.”
He continued, “The approach that we’ve taken to false news is not to say, you can’t say something wrong on the internet. I think that that would be too extreme. Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down people’s accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that. But at the same time, I think that we have a responsibility to, when you look at… if you look at the top hundred things that are going viral or getting distribution on Facebook within any given day, I do think we have a responsibility to make sure that those aren’t hoaxes and blatant misinformation.”
Zuckerberg also said, “We look at the things that are getting the most distribution. If people have flag[ged] them as potential hoaxes, we send those to fact-checkers who are all well reputable (sic) and have followed standard principles for fact checking, and if those fact checkers say that it is provably false, then we will significantly reduce the distribution of that content.”
Zuckerberg went on to say, “I’m not defending any specific content here. I think a lot of the content that’s at play is terrible. I think when you get into discussions around free speech, you’re often talking at the margins of content that is terrible and what should ... but defending people’s right to say things even if they can be bad.”
Swisher then said stories that say Sandy Hook did not happen are false, and asked, “You can’t just take that down?”
Zuckerberg agreed they were false and said, “I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, ‘Hey, no, you’re a liar’ — that is harassment, and we actually will take that down.” 
He then said, “I’m Jewish, and there’s a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened.” He added, “I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don’t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.”
Swisher said, “In the case of the Holocaust deniers, they might be, but go ahead.”
Zuckerberg continued, “It’s hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. I just think, as abhorrent as some of those examples are, I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly. I’m sure you do. I’m sure a lot of leaders and public figures we respect do too, and I just don’t think that it is the right thing to say, ‘We’re going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times.’”
He said, “What we will do is we’ll say, ‘Okay, you have your page, and if you’re not trying to organize harm against someone, or attacking someone, then you can put up that content on your page, even if people might disagree with it or find it offensive.’ But that doesn’t mean that we have a responsibility to make it widely distributed in News Feed.”
Other Facebook statements on its content policies
In 2009, some people criticized Facebook for allowing anti-Semitic pages. Facebook said at the time, “We want to be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas, including controversial ones.”
Last Tuesday, Facebook’s global head of policy management Monika Bickert testified before Congress on the company’s content filtering policies. Bickert said there is a “certain threshold of violations” that must be met before Facebook would remove pages from its site. She said, “That threshold varies, depending on the severity of different types of violations.” Some lawmakers at the hearing requested that Facebook ban more accounts from its site, including Infowars.
Last Wednesday, Facebook also said in a statement, “Reducing the distribution of misinformation—rather than removing it outright—strikes the right balance between free expression and a safe and authentic community. There are certain forms of misinformation that have contributed to physical harm, and we are making a policy change which will enable us to take that type of content down.”
The company said it would work with unnamed local groups in Sri Lanka and Myanmar to determine which posts could possibly contribute to violence there. In March, Sri Lanka blocked Facebook for three days following violence against Muslims. The Guardian reported that Facebook posts had spread misinformation about the Muslim community there. In Myanmar, there has been violence against Rohingya Muslims.
Facebook provided an example of some posts in Sri Lanka that alleged that Muslims were poisoning Buddhists’ food. A local group informed Facebook that it believed the posts could lead to violence, and the company removed them. Facebook said it will consider the possibility of implementing such a policy in the U.S. and elsewhere in the future.
When asked in Wednesday’s interview about his feelings about the possible role Facebook has played in killings in Myanmar, Zuckerberg said, “People use tools for good and bad, but I think that we have a clear responsibility to make sure that the good is amplified and to do everything we can to mitigate the bad.”
Response to Zuckerberg’s comments
Chief Executive of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt said Holocaust denial is “a willful, deliberate and longstanding deception tactic by anti-Semites.” He added, “Facebook has a moral and ethical obligation not to allow its dissemination.”
Benjy Sarlin of NBC News tweeted, “So apparently Mark Zuckerberg is under the impression there's some good faith debate going on over whether the Holocaust happened?”
Zuckerberg’s post-interview clarification
Zuckerberg wrote in a follow up email, “there’s one thing I want to clear up. I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely didn’t intend to defend the intent of people who deny that.”
He said, “Our goal with fake news is not to prevent anyone from saying something untrue — but to stop fake news and misinformation spreading across our services. If something is spreading and is rated false by fact checkers, it would lose the vast majority of its distribution in News Feed. And of course if a post crossed [the] line into advocating for violence or hate against a particular group, it would be removed. These issues are very challenging but I believe that often the best way to fight offensive bad speech is with good speech.”

40111,2018-07-23,"At least 3 dead, 13 injured in shooting in Toronto","An armed suspect killed at least two people and injured 13 on Sunday night in Toronto, Canada, the city’s police confirmed on Monday morning. The suspect, a 29-year-old man, killed an 18-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl. The suspect also died. 
Around 10 p.m. Sunday night, the suspect fired shots from a handgun into restaurants and cafes along a street in the city’s Greektown area, The Associated Press reported. When police officers arrived, they exchanged gunfire with the suspect before he fled. He was later found dead on the street, and the Toronto Star reported it was unknown whether he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from police fire. 
Police say they have not ruled out any motives for the attack. Toronto Councilor Paula Fletcher told a city council meeting on Monday that it was not “gang related,” and was “indiscriminate.”
The injured are aged between 10 and 59 years old, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening, Mayor John Tory said. The Toronto police said they were all in the hospital as of Monday morning. The names of the victims have not been released. 
After the shooting, the scene was closed for police investigation. The Toronto Police Homicide Squad is investigating the shootings and homicides. The Special Investigation Unit is investigating an interaction between the suspect and the Toronto Police. A spokeswoman for the unit said the shooter’s identity is still being confirmed.

40060,2018-07-23,"Israel helps evacuate 422 White Helmets, family members from Syria to Jordan","Overnight Saturday, Israel helped evacuate hundreds of White Helmet volunteer rescue workers and their families out of Syria into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and then to Jordan. Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi tweeted that 422 people had been evacuated. The White Helmets, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense, operate in rebel-held parts of Syria, running rescue missions after airstrikes and other attacks in the country’s civil war.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as officials from other countries, had requested Israel’s help with the evacuation. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the U.K. had also requested the evacuation. 
Netanyahu said, “The lives of these people, who have saved lives, were now in danger. I therefore authorized their transfer via Israel to other countries as an important humanitarian gesture.” 
According to its website, The White Helmets’ “unarmed and neutral rescue workers have saved more than 114,431 people from the attacks in Syria.” Russia and supporters of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad have said the White Helmets support Syrian rebels and have connections with jihadist groups. Assad said the White Helmets used “humanitarian masks and umbrellas just to implement a certain agenda.”
Raed al-Saleh, head of the White Helmets, said a “number” of volunteers and their families were evacuated for “purely humanitarian reasons.” He added, “they were trapped in a dangerous area.” Syrian government and allied forces have been on an offensive in southwestern Syria since June.
After the evacuation, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) said ""Israel continues to maintain a non-intervention policy regarding the Syrian conflict.""
About 100 of those evacuated to Jordan were White Helmets; the rest were family members, BBC reported. The original plan had been to evacuate about 800 people. Reuters cited a non-Jordanian source saying government checkpoints and the presence of Islamic State (IS) in the area near the evacuation had limited the number of people able to be transported across the Syrian-Israeli border.
Jordan's government confirmed it had “authorized the United Nations to organize the passage of 800 Syrian citizens through Jordan to be resettled in Western countries.” The UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, said “While in Jordan, UNHCR in close collaboration with the involved governments, is supporting their temporary stay in anticipation of their onward relocation to third countries.”
Jordan said, ""Britain, Germany and Canada made a legally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to 'a risk to their lives'.""
A spokeswoman for the German interior ministry said the country would accept eight White Helmets and their families.
Canada said it had “agreed” to accept 50 White Helmets and their families, the CBC reported.
Britain said it would provide protection to “as many of the volunteers and their families as possible.”
The White Helmets began in early 2013, according to BBC, after the Syrian civil war started in 2011. It is composed of about 3,000 volunteers who also do repair work, and about 200 of its members have been killed. The group is funded by public donations and foreign governments.

40053,2018-07-23,FBI releases FISA surveillance warrant application for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page,"On Saturday, the FBI released partially-redacted Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications for the surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications said the FBI “believes Page has been the subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian government” as part of its alleged 2016 election interference efforts. The applications were also the subject of the February Republican “Nunes memo” and a Democratic response memo. Page has denied being an agent for Russia and has not been charged with a crime related to the investigation.
The 412-page document contains the original 66-page October 2016 warrant application, and three subsequent renewal applications, each progressively longer in page count. The New York Times, Judicial Watch and others requested the Justice Department (DOJ) release the documents under the Freedom of Information Act. According to its website, Judicial Watch, Inc. is “a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation, [which] promotes transparency, accountability and integrity in government, politics and the law.” 
The FISA applications said Page “has established relationships with Russian government officials, including Russian intelligence officers” and that the FBI believed “the Russian government’s efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with” Trump’s campaign. It also alleged that Page “has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government.” The application said, ""there is probable cause that such activities involve or are about to involve violations of the criminal statutes of the United States."" In a partially redacted section, the document also mentioned “undermin[ing] and influenc[ing] the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in violation of U.S. criminal law.”
On Sunday, Page said the allegations against him in the FISA warrant application were “so ridiculous.” He said, “You talk about misleading the courts, it’s just so misleading.” “It’s literally a complete joke,” he added.
The application referred to Page as a “former foreign policy adviser” of then-candidate Trump. On Sunday, Page said the term “adviser” was “way over the top.” “I sat in on some meetings,” he said.
On Sunday morning, Trump tweeted, “Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of ‘Justice’ and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!”
The Republican and Democratic memos
Trump allowed the FISA warrant applications’ existence to be declassified in February, prior to the release of the “Nunes memo,” a document written by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his staff.
The Nunes memo said the applications showed a “troubling breakdown” of the FISA process. According to the memo, the original October 2016 application cited an unverified “dossier” on Trump that was compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele with the help of Democratic National Committee (DNC) funding. Then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified that the FBI would not have sought the warrant without the dossier, according to the memo.
Democrats on the committee later released their own memo, saying the DOJ had an “independent basis” for investigating Page, including work he did with Russian state-owned companies while living in Moscow for three years, and that Russian spies allegedly tried to recruit Page. The memo said only a “specific sub-section” of the FISA warrant mentions the Steele report, regarding Page’s alleged visit to Russia in March 2016 while a Trump campaign adviser. 
The Nunes memo alleged the FBI did not disclose in the FISA warrant or renewal applications that Steele’s report was financed by the DNC. The Democratic memo said the FBI disclosed to the FISA judges “the assessed political motivation of those who hired” Steele.
No other FISA applications for warrants have been made public since the FISA act passed in 1978, according to the Times.

40049,2018-07-23,"In seeming reference to Cohen recording, Trump says ‘inconceivable’ lawyer would tape client","On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that it was “inconceivable” that a lawyer would tape a client. His current lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Trump did not know he was being recorded in a September 2016 conversation with his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen about former Playboy model Karen McDougal. McDougal has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006; Trump has denied it. 
In August 2016, American Media Inc. (AMI), which owns the National Enquirer, bought the rights to McDougal’s story for $150,000 and did not run it, the Wall Street Journal reported. Giuliani said the arrangement involved a “non-disclosure agreement.” 
Situations in which payments are made to keep stories from becoming public are sometimes called “catch-and-kill.” If a “catch-and-kill” payment is made by a corporation, specifically to aid a presidential campaign, such a payment could be in violation of federal election laws. 
In 2016, Cohen, through a company he set up, paid $130,000 to adult actress Stephanie Clifford (known as “Stormy Daniels”) as part of an agreement not to discuss an affair she said she had with Trump in 2006. Trump denied the affair. Trump later personally reimbursed Cohen for unspecified “expenses.” Giuliani said Cohen’s payment “was about personal reputation. The money wasn’t paid to help the campaign or hurt the campaign.” He added that Trump had Cohen on a retainer and “didn’t know about the specifics” to which his payment to Cohen related.
On Nov. 4, 2016, the Journal published an article about AMI’s deal with McDougal. The article quoted Trump’s campaign spokeswoman at the time, Hope Hicks, as saying, “We have no knowledge of any of this.”
In his recorded September 2016 conversation with Trump, Cohen recommended buying the rights from AMI, and Trump asked how they might do that, according to a source familiar with the tape cited by CNN.
Giuliani said Friday that “nothing in that conversation suggests that [Trump] had any knowledge of it [AMI’s payment to McDougal] in advance.” Giuliani said that in the taped conversation, Trump had mentioned that any payment ""to reimburse AMI for what they laid out” should be done “by check, properly recorded."" No such payment occurred, according to Giuliani. “In the big scheme of things, it’s powerful exculpatory evidence [for Trump],” he added.
The FBI seized the recording along with other documents from Cohen’s office in April under a search warrant. The Justice Department is investigating Cohen over “personal business dealings.” He has not been charged with a crime in the case.
A “special master” decided that 2,633 out of 900,000 documents seized by the FBI from Cohen qualified as privileged or partially privileged, CNBC reported. According to the State Bar of California, “special masters” are court-appointed attorneys who examine seized evidence that has been “in possession or under the control” of attorneys. Special masters “balance the interests” of the attorneys and their clients “in protecting privileged materials” with the interests of prosecutors “in securing evidence of suspected criminal activity.” 
A “special master” deemed the Trump-Cohen recording to be client-attorney privileged, CNN reported. Trump’s lawyers later requested the privilege be withdrawn, meaning the recording could be used in the government’s investigation of Cohen. 
Comments on the recording
On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted, “Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of  just as is #Trump’s false #Twitter statement made against @michaelcohen212 this morning. Rudy claims the tape is ‘exculpatory’.  Why so angry?”
Asked about Davis' tweet, Giuliani said, ""How would you feel if your lawyer was recording you without telling you?,"" CNN reported. Giuliani added that Trump's ""tweet is straightforward and correct.""
In April, AMI published a statement that said, “Ms. McDougal has always been free to talk about her relationship with President Trump — at least since her 2016 amendment of her contract with AMI — as her 90 minute interview with Anderson Cooper [in March, 2018] made clear.” According to The New York Times, AMI amended its agreement with McDougal in 2016 after the presidential election in 2016.

40220,2018-07-24,Israel shoots down Syrian jet; both countries say plane was in their airspace,"On Tuesday, Israel said it shot down a Syrian fighter jet that had crossed into Israeli-occupied Golan Heights airspace, while Syria said it was over Syrian territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel first tried to warn the plane to return to Syrian airspace and then fired two Patriot interceptor missiles at the Russian-made Syrian Sukhoi jet, which it said was 1.2 miles (2 km) into Israeli territory. Syria said the plane was conducting strikes against rebels in Syrian territory. 
A 1974 Separation of Forces agreement after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and neighboring Arab states established a ceasefire. It established an area between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, along Israel’s northeastern border, that would be monitored by a United Nations force to ensure that the terms of the ceasefire agreement were upheld.
The U.N. said its peacekeepers “observed burning debris falling from an aircraft” about  6 miles (10 km) inside Syrian territory. The pilot of the plane was killed, according to a non-Syrian source close to the Syrian government that was cited by Reuters. The source said the plane fell in an area controlled by the Islamic State (IS). 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Syrian airplane flying in Israel-controlled airspace had been a “gross violation” of the separation of forces between Israel and Syria. He said Israel “took appropriate action.”
Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said due to fighting in Syria close to the Golan Heights border, “We issued warnings and messages through different channels in various languages numerous times over the day in order to avoid any miscalculations, misunderstandings or any violations of Israeli air space.”
Nickolay Mladenov, a U.N. envoy for the Middle East, said Tuesday there was a “disturbing trajectory of increasingly frequent and dangerous confrontations” between Israel and Syria. He said, “I call on all parties to abide by all the provisions of the 1974 agreement.”
IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis said, “The IDF is ready and vigilant and will continue to act against violations of the 1974 separation of forces agreements.""
A Syrian military source cited by state-run news agency SANA called the Israeli action an “aggression,” and said that by shooting down a Syrian plane that was bombing a “terrorist group,” Israel helped the “terrorists.” 
Other Israeli-Syrian border incidents
The only other time since 1985 that Israel has shot down a Russian-made Syrian jet was in 2014, when it shot down a Sukhoi-24 over the Golan Heights, using the same missile battery as on Tuesday. In 2014, the plane was about half a mile (800 meters) inside Israeli airspace, according to Israeli news outlet Haaretz, and Israel reportedly decided within 80 seconds to intercept it. The aircraft was hit while traveling back towards Syria and its pilots ejected and landed in Syrian territory, Haaretz reported.
In February of this year, Syrian anti-aircraft fire downed an Israeli F-16 jet returning from bombing what Israel said was an Iranian military target in Syria, according to Reuters. Both pilots ejected before the plane crashed in northern Israel.
On Monday, Israel used its “David’s Sling” missile-defense system for the first time against two Syrian surface-to-surface missiles that were calculated to be likely to land in Israeli-controlled territory. Israel ordered the self-destruction of one of the interceptor missiles in flight after it determined the Syrian missile would fall in Syrian territory. The second interceptor missile missed its target and fell in Syrian territory, Haaretz reported.
Syria began an offensive against rebels in the southwest of its country in June. The Syrian army has 201 “fighter aircraft,” 134 “attack aircraft,” and 154,000 active soldiers, according to GlobalFirepower.

40216,2018-07-24,463 migrant parents separated from children no longer in US; 879 others reunited as of Monday,"In a court filing on Monday, the government said 463 parents of migrant children were no longer present in the U.S., and their cases were “under review.” The filing also said the government had reunited 879 children with their parents so far, and another 538 parents had been cleared for reunions. The filing said 917 parents, including the 463 that may have been deported without their children, were either not eligible or not yet determined to be eligible to be reunited with their children.
On June 26, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite all separated migrant children with their parents by this Thursday. Then last week Sabraw ordered the government to temporarily suspend deportations of reunited families and requested it update the court as to how many of the parents of the more than 2,500 separated children in the U.S. were no longer in the country. 
Some of the separations resulted from the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy,” announced in April, which called for all adults who illegally crossed the border to be prosecuted. President Donald Trump later signed an executive order to end the separations on June 20, ordering authorities to detain “alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.” 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) requested that the government provide the court, by the end of the day Tuesday, with a list of migrant parents who had signed a form giving their consent for the government to deport them without their children. The ACLU said in its court filing that migrant parents “urgently need consultations with lawyers, so that they do not mistakenly strand their children” in the U.S. ACLU lawyer Stephen Kang said, “We have concerns about misinformation given to these parents about their rights to fight deportation without their children.” 
The government said all of the migrant parents who it deported had given written consent that they were informed of their rights in their native language.
Some parents with criminal records or who are deemed to be unfit may not be eligible to be reunited with their children. Before reuniting families, the government: confirms familial relationships through DNA testing, performs background checks for criminal records, assesses the parents fitness to care for their children, and asks parents if they want to be reunited with their children. About 130 parents have opted not to be reunited, The Washington Post reported.

40163,2018-07-24,White House says Trump considering revoking security clearance of former US national security officials,"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump was “looking to” revoke the security clearances of former U.S. intelligence officials, including former CIA director John Brennan. Sanders alleged that the former officials had “politicized” their security clearances and made “inappropriate” and “baseless” accusations that Trump is improperly working with Russia. 
Sanders was responding to a question at a press briefing about Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) alleging that Brennan is “monetizing his security clearance” and asking Trump to remove it. Brennan tweeted that Trump’s press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last week was “treasonous,” and alleged that Trump was “in the pocket of Putin.” 
Sanders said, “Making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the President is extremely inappropriate. And the fact that people with security clearances are making these baseless charges provides inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence.”
Sanders named five other former officials whose security clearances Trump would consider revoking: former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI director James Comey, former CIA and NSA director Gen. Michael Hayden, former deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice. Of the six total former officials Sanders mentioned by name, five served under the Obama administration, and one in the George W. Bush administration. 
McCabe was fired in March of this year, 26 hours before his scheduled retirement, by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who cited a report that said the deputy director made an “unauthorized disclosure” to the media and “lacked candor” with investigators about an FBI case involving Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for McCabe, Melissa Schwartz, tweeted that his clearance had been deactivated when he was fired, “according to what we were told was FBI policy.” 
Comey, whom Trump dismissed in May of last year, reportedly also had his security clearance removed, according to unnamed sources cited by The New York Times. Hayden tweeted after Sanders’ announcement that he does not attend the White House classified briefings and the removal of his security clearance would not affect what he says publicly. 
Sanders said Trump is “exploring the mechanisms to remove security clearance” of the individuals “because they’ve politicized and, in some cases, monetized their public service and security clearances.” Brennan and Hayden are national security analysts and contributors for news sites MSNBC and CNN, respectively. Comey published a book this year and did interviews about it on news networks. Sanders did not provide information or evidence showing that the former officials used classified information obtained through their security clearances in political ways. 

“The president doesn't like the fact that people are politicizing agencies and departments that are specifically meant to not be political and not meant to be monetized off of security clearance,” Sanders said in response to a follow-up question about whether Trump wanted to “punish” speech he didn’t agree with.

40137,2018-07-24,Chinese President Xi orders investigation into company that produced defective vaccines,"Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered an investigation into the illegal production of two types of defective vaccines by Changchun Changsheng Life Sciences Limited, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday. The food and drug authority in the province where the company is located announced that more than 250,000 doses of the company’s vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or whooping cough, (DTP) were substandard. 
The DTP vaccine is subsidized by the Chinese government and infants across the country are inoculated with it. 
More than 250,000 DTP vaccine doses from the batch had been sold to disease control and prevention centers in eastern China, according to state media outlet CGTN. It is not known how many children may have been inoculated with the substandard vaccines, BBC reported, and there have been no reports of any children becoming ill after being inoculated.
Separately, China’s Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) announced on Sunday that during a July 15 government inspection, it found that the drug company had falsified data, including “production records and product inspection records,” while manufacturing its human rabies vaccine. According to Xinhua, 113,000 doses of the rabies vaccine were affected. The CFDA ordered the company to stop producing the vaccine and to “comprehensively” investigate the risks it posed. 
Since the discovery, the CFDA has revoked Changchun Changsheng’s license for human rabies vaccine, recalled unused supplies of the vaccine and fined the company 3.4 million yuan ($510,000). There is no evidence anyone was harmed by the use of the defective vaccines, according to the CFDA.  
Xi said it was the responsibility of all Communist Party committees and all levels of government to ensure drug safety in the country.
China’s federal government sent a team to investigate Changchun Changsheng, which is located in the city of Changchun, the capital of Jilin province. Other teams at the provincial and city levels have started investigating Changchun Changsheng and other pharmaceutical companies in the province, according to Xinhua. 
The chairwoman and four executives of the company were taken into custody for questioning, CNN reported. The Changchun city police have opened a criminal investigation into the company. 
In a statement, Changchun Changsheng management said the company felt ""very ashamed and guilty"" about the vaccines and would “learn a lesson and take practical corrective measures and rectify thoroughly.""

40141,2018-07-24,Virginia judge agrees to delay start of Manafort’s trial,"On Monday, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III delayed the start of Paul Manafort’s Virginia trial until July 31, agreeing to a request by Manafort’s lawyers for more time to review thousands of pages of documents provided by prosecutors. Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, is facing charges of financial crimes, such as filing false tax returns, bank fraud and conspiracy to launder money. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. 
The charges result from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, whether any members of the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia, and “related matters.” The charges against Manafort do not focus on work he did for the Trump campaign, nor do they relate to alleged Russian interference. 
Manafort will go on trial in Virginia for charges including filing false tax returns, failure to report on foreign accounts and bank fraud. The Virginia trial was originally scheduled to begin on Wednesday, prior to the judge’s delay. Manafort is facing separate charges in Washington, D.C., and is scheduled to go to trial in September there. Those charges include conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice, all of which he denies. 
Ellis, the judge, said jury selection would happen this week, as scheduled. He also approved and unsealed a request by prosecutors to offer five witnesses immunity in exchange for their testimony. This means witnesses’ statements cannot be used against them in any criminal cases.
Ellis also required prosecutors to submit their full list of witnesses, which totals about 30 people, by the end of Monday, according to NPR.

40127,2018-07-24,"US says Iran will face ‘consequences’ if it does ‘anything negative’ to US, following Rouhani remarks","U.S. national security adviser John Bolton released a statement on Monday that said President Donald Trump told him Iran would “pay a price” if it did “anything negative” towards the U.S. On Sunday evening, Trump tweeted that Iran should “never, ever threaten” the U.S. again or it would “suffer consequences.” The tweet came after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and said “war with Iran is the mother of all wars.” 
Rouhani, at a meeting of Iranian diplomats in the Iranian capital city of Tehran on Sunday, said, “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.” He said, “Mr. Trump, don’t play with the lion’s tail, this would only lead to regret.”
“You [Trump] cannot provoke the Iranian people against their own security and interests,” Rouhani said in a televised speech from the meeting. 
The U.S. is scheduled to resume economic sanctions against Iran in August, which had been removed under the terms of the nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iran and the remaining five signatories on the deal (the U.K, China, France, Germany and Russia) have been in negotiations to establish new terms in the deal to compensate for the U.S.’ decision to resume sanctions. Rouhani alleged the U.S. was interfering in Iran’s negotiations with the EU countries, Iranian state news agency INRA reported, without elaborating on what the alleged interference was.
“Despite provoking the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to take actions against Iran, they failed to do so and then the US embarked on another approach, namely to persuade the EU to review the Iran Deal,” Rouhani said. “The JCPOA was tantamount to defeat of 12 years of conspiracies against Iran's acquisition of the nuclear technology,” and was the “unified decision of all pillars of the establishment in Iran.”
Following Rouhani’s remarks, Trump’s full tweet said, “To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE  DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!”
Bolton said in a statement released by the White House on Monday that he had spoken to the president over the last “several” days. “President Trump told me that if Iran does anything at all to the negative, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid before,” Bolton said. Neither Trump nor Bolton specified what actions the U.S. would take against Iran. 
Also on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. would pursue a ""diplomatic and economic pressure campaign"" on Iran, adding that the Trump administration was seeking to limit Iranian crude exports ""as close to zero as possible by November 4.” He added that Trump was ""willing to talk"" to the Iranian government if it showed signs of change.

40282,2018-07-25,"81 dead, nearly 190 injured in wildfires in southern Greece","As of Wednesday, at least 81 people have been killed by wildfires that started Monday in southern Greece, according to the fire brigade. The Civil Protection Agency also reported that nearly 190 people were injured in the fires, which occurred in the Attica region of southern Greece, where the country’s capital, Athens, is located. Authorities have not confirmed the cause of the fires, CBS News reported. 
Two fires were still burning on Wednesday morning in Kineta, in western Attica, according to CNN. Wind gusts reached up to 75 mph (120 km/h) in the area and temperatures reached about 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37°C). Combined with low humidity, conditions were “ideal” for rapid spread of the fires, according to the National Observatory of Athens.
More than 15 fires started on three separate fronts on Monday afternoon, government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. He said Greece had requested drones from the U.S. to ""detect any suspicious activity."" Greek anti-terrorist officials are investigating whether the fires were started deliberately, Reuters reported a security source as saying. Supreme Court Prosecutor Xeni Dimitriou has ordered an investigation to determine the cause of the fires. 
A navy frigate, two gunships, three helicopters, 12 port vessels and 30 private vessels were involved in rescue efforts, Tzanakopoulos said. Hundreds of firefighters were working to put out the fires. Greece asked for help from other nations; Cyprus, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria offered firefighting planes, trucks and paramedics.
On Tuesday, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared three days of mourning. The Greek government approved $23 million (20 million euros) in aid for those affected by the wildfires, Tzanakopoulos said. Greek soccer team Olympiacos and its owner Evangelos Marinakis said Tuesday the team is donating about $1.2 million (one million euros) to help those affected by the fires.
The fires destroyed houses in the resort village of Mati, about 21 miles (33 km) east of Athens, as it moved towards the sea
“We took our cars and went down to the sea and got into the sea to escape,” said Agni Gantona, a Mati resident who witnessed the fires. “But there were people who did not make it.” She continued, “We got into the water and stayed there for about five hours until the boats came to pick us up.” 
“We were at the beach with about 250, 300 people,” Gantona added. “Some [people] were burned, some were near fainting from the smoke and the flames. Groups of us, we were holding each other by the hand and shouting each other’s names, because we could not see from the smoke.”
Boats took people from the beaches and the water off the coast of Mati to the nearby town of Rafina, where buses took them to hotels, said Tzanakopoulos, the government spokesman. 
Grigoris Leon, head of the Hellenic Society of Forensic Medicine, said, “Work has started on identifying the victims of the wildfires but the majority of the bodies are totally charred.” Identification efforts were occurring at a morgue in Shisto, west of Athens, Reuters reported.

40232,2018-07-25,USDA announces $12 billion in emergency aid to farmers affected by overseas tariffs,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced $12 billion in emergency aid to farmers affected by retaliatory overseas tariffs. White House officials said payments to farmers will begin in September. The aid does not require congressional approval and would include direct payments to farmers, funding to promote American agricultural goods in other countries, and more money for an existing program to purchase food and distribute it to food banks and other organizations, according to The Washington Post.
Depending on the program, farm goods eligible for aid would include soybeans, wheat, milk, legumes and nuts, Bloomberg reported. 
Portions of the aid would be distributed under a program created in 1933 called the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which is part of the USDA. The CCC spends more than $10 billion annually on programs such as trade promotion and surplus farm goods purchases. Trump’s proposed 2019 budget would have decreased CCC funding, the Post reported. 
The U.S. is projected to have a trade surplus of $21 billion in agriculture this year, according to Bloomberg. The three largest buyers of U.S. agricultural goods are Canada, China and Mexico. In 2017, the three countries accounted for 43 percent of purchases of U.S. farm goods. All three countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including agricultural products, in response to steel and aluminum tariffs the U.S. imposed on them.
Tariffs
In April, China imposed tariffs on $2.97 billion worth of U.S. imports, including pork, in response to the U.S.’ 10 percent tariff on aluminum and 25 percent tariff on steel imports from China. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods in response to the country’s policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation being “unreasonable or discriminatory and burden[ing] or restrict[ing] U.S. commerce,” according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. China imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. imports in response. Among the 545 U.S. goods on which China imposed tariffs were beef, soybeans, dairy and other farm goods. 
Last Friday, Trump said he was “ready to go” regarding the imposition of tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods in the future if China continued to impose retaliatory tariffs and trade measures on U.S. goods.
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the temporary farm aid measures were necessary to send ""a firm statement that other nations cannot bully our agriculture producers to force the United States to cave in.”
Earlier this year, Trump ordered Perdue to formulate a plan to compensate farmers for lost sales and lower prices as a result of other countries’ retaliatory tariffs.
At a speech Tuesday in Missouri, President Donald Trump said of his trade policies, “The farmers will be the biggest beneficiary. Watch, we are opening up markets, you watch what is going to happen, just be a little patient.”
Response to the USDA aid announcement
President of the American Farm Bureau Federation Zippy Duvall said the aid ""will provide a welcome measure of temporary relief to our farmers and ranchers.” 
“But we cannot overstate the dire consequences that farmers and ranchers are facing in relation to lost export markets, and we will continue to push for a swift and sure end to the trade war,” he added.
On Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tweeted, “If tariffs punish farmers, the answer is not welfare for farmers. The answer is remove the tariffs.”
Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said, “The trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers and White House’s ‘plan’ is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches. America’s farmers don’t want to be paid to lose — they want to win by feeding the world.”
House Agriculture Committee Chairman K. Michael Conaway (R-Texas) said, in apparent reference to China, “Our president stood up to a bully; now he’s standing up for rural America. This is the right fight to have, but in the meantime, our producers have got to . . . live, while this fight’s going on.”
On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, “Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! Remember, we are the ‘piggy bank’ that’s being robbed. All will be Great!”

40234,2018-07-25,AG Sessions says freedom of thought and speech ‘under attack’ at US universities,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday that freedom of thought and speech at universities was “under attack.” Speaking at a High School Leadership Summit, he said, “Too many schools are coddling young people and actively preventing them from scrutinizing the validity of their beliefs and the issues of the day.” Mary Sue Coleman, president of the Association of American Universities, said in response, “The idea that we’re somehow protecting [students] from any idea that may be controversial is a total mischaracterization.”
The sponsor of the event, Turning Point USA, is a non-profit organization whose “mission is to identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote the principles of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government,” according to its website. The speech was held at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. 
Sessions said, “Rather than molding a generation of mature, well-informed adults, some schools are doing everything they can to create a generation of sanctimonious, sensitive, supercilious snowflakes. … That is a disservice to the students and a disservice to the nation.” 
Sessions also spoke about “freedom of speech zones” on some university campuses where students could say things in limited areas that university policies prohibited them from saying elsewhere on campus. He discussed protests and cancellations of multiple conservative speakers’ events at universities as well.
Sessions said last year the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) had surveyed 450 colleges and universities across the U.S. and found that 40 percent of universities had speech codes that he said “substantially infringe on constitutionally-protected speech.” That percentage had decreased to 32 percent this year, he added. According to its website, the mission of FIRE is to “defend and sustain the individual rights of students and faculty members at America’s colleges and universities.” It said those rights included freedom of speech and association, due process, legal equality, religious liberties and “sanctity of conscience.”
“Too many schools are coddling students,” Sessions said. “After the 2016 election, for example, they held a ‘cry-in’ at Cornell … they had therapy dogs at the University of Kansas” and “Play-Doh and coloring books” at the University of Michigan. “They have cry closets, safe spaces, optional exams, therapy goats and grade inflation,” he said. “I can tell this group isn’t going to have to have Play-Doh when you get attacked in college.” 
Some of the practices that Sessions mentioned, such as therapy animals, are designed to reduce rates of stress, depression and suicide on college campuses. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), in 2016, suicide was the second leading cause of death of college students. The AFSP said, “Over the past decade, colleges and universities have made considerable efforts to promote how and where students can get help for mental health problems both on and off campus.”
In his speech, Sessions also mentioned “trigger warnings,” which certain universities use to inform people about speakers’ subject matter that some may find traumatic. 
Coleman, the university association president and a former president of the University of Michigan, said after Sessions’ speech, “I don’t think [college students are] coddled. I don’t think they’re given undue access to support services.”
At the event, Sessions said, “When you get involved in a debate, you’re going to stand up and defend yourselves and the values that you believe in.” 
“I like this bunch, I gotta tell ya, you’re not going to be backing down,” he said. “Go get ‘em! Go get em’!” 
A moment later, the crowd began to chant “Lock her up!” Sessions repeated the phrase once, then laughed and said, “I heard that a long time over the last campaign.” 
During President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and at rallies while he has been president, audiences have sometimes chanted “Lock her up!” in an apparent reference to Hillary Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration.
Other people scheduled to speak at the leadership event which runs through Thursday include U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and Donald Trump, Jr.
Sessions' full speech is available to watch here.

40321,2018-07-26,At least 215 killed in multiple suicide attacks in southwest Syria; IS claims responsibility,"At least 215 people were killed and 180 injured in suicide bombings and other attacks on Wednesday near the city of Sweida in southwestern Syria, according to the Sweida health authority. Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attacks. Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported that security forces had killed two other potential suicide bombers before they were able to detonate their explosives. 
During Wednesday’s attacks, one suicide bomber attacked a vegetable market on a motorcycle, according to SANA. IS fighters also attacked three villages northeast of Sweida, SANA reported.
The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported that there were multiple suicide attacks in Sweida, and in villages to the north and east of it. The observatory reported a total of at least 221 dead, 127 of them civilians.
The observatory said some militants also attacked people in their homes in the villages.
Militants also kidnapped about 40 women and children in one of the villages early Thursday morning local time, a resident of the village of Shbiki told The Associated Press. 
Syria began an offensive to retake rebel-held areas in the southwest of the country in June. The government is also fighting IS-affiliate forces near Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, in Syria’s southwest, and near the border with Jordan, AP reported. The group reportedly also has some forces on the eastern edge of Sweida province.

40318,2018-07-26,"Trump, EU leader Juncker agree to ‘work towards’ zero tariffs, subsidies on non-auto goods","President Donald Trump announced that he and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had agreed “to work together towards zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,” following a meeting of the two leaders. Juncker said he and Trump agreed that while trade negotiations were ongoing, they would “hold off further tariffs and reassess existing tariffs on steel and aluminum,” which the U.S. imposed on EU imports last month. 
Trump has said in recent months that he would consider imposing 20 to 25 percent tariffs on automobiles from the EU. 
After the presidents’ meeting in the Oval Office, Trump said relations between the U.S. and the EU had entered a “new phase” of “close friendship” and “strong trade relations in which both of us will win.” He added that relations would involve “working better together for global security and prosperity” and “fighting jointly against terrorism.”
Trump also said the U.S. and EU would work together to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO), which deals with trade rules and agreements among member states. He also announced that the EU would import more U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
Juncker said, “As far as agriculture is concerned, the European Union can import more soybeans from the U.S., and it will be done.” He added, “The EU will build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas from the U.S.”
Trade relations 
Trump said the U.S. and EU have a $1 trillion trade relationship and together account for 50 percent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). He said the two sides agreed to start a “close dialogue on standards, in order to ease trade, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs dramatically.”
Juncker said, “We have identified a number of areas on which to work together, work towards zero tariffs on industrial goods,” adding that was his “main intention.”
Trump said it was a “very big day for free and fair trade” and said the two sides would “resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues and we will resolve retaliatory tariffs. 
“We have some tariffs that are retaliatory and that will get resolved as part of what we’re doing,” Trump said. “We’re starting the negotiation right now, but we know very much where it’s going.”
The Trump administration implemented steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from some countries in March, giving the EU and select other countries a temporary exemption. The U.S. allowed the EU’s exemption to expire on June 1. 
On June 22, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on $3.4 billion (2.9 billion euros) of American imports including steel products, agricultural products, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
On July 17, the White House announced the scheduled meeting between Trump and Juncker, saying that they would discuss “a wide range of priorities, including foreign and security policy, counterterrorism, energy security, and economic growth,” and “focus on improving transatlantic trade and forging a stronger economic partnership.”
Possible automotive tariffs
In March, Trump said during a press conference with the Swedish prime minister that the EU has been “tough” on the U.S., “yet they send their cars and everything else back” to the U.S. “We can put a tax of 25 percent on their cars and believe me they won't be doing It for very long.” Last month, he tweeted that the U.S. would “be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S.,” if the trade tariffs and barriers were not removed “soon.”
This week, media sources, including Politico and The Washington Post, reported that Trump was considering imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported automobiles. The EU said it is preparing a list of $20 billion worth of U.S. goods on which it could apply retaliatory tariffs if the U.S. implemented the proposed automobile tariffs.
The EU currently has a 10 percent tariff on imports of U.S. automobiles, the Post reported, while the U.S. has a 2.5 percent tariff on European car imports and 25 percent on light truck and sport-utility vehicle imports. The U.S. imported $192 billion in new passenger vehicles in 2017, the Post reported. 
The Trump administration could also impose tariffs on imports of automobile parts, which together with cars and trucks made up about $335 billion in imports last year, according to The Associated Press. The Commerce Department may announce, in September, the results of its national security-based investigation, begun on May 23, into automobile-related imports, with recommendations for Trump on possible tariffs or other measures.

40313,2018-07-26,Suicide bomb at Pakistan polling station kills 31 during general elections,"A suicide bomber killed at least 31 people and injured more than 40 others near a polling station in the Pakistani city of Quetta on Wednesday after polls opened for the country’s parliamentary elections. The bomber used a motorcycle and may have targeted a police convoy, Al Jazeera reported. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack through its affiliated-news site, Amaq. 
At least 203 people have been killed in violence leading up to the election, Al Jazeera reported. On July 13, for instance, at least 130 people were killed in two separate attacks at political rallies in Pakistan. 
About 400,000 troops were deployed at polling stations, approximately one-fifth of the number deployed in 2013, according to The Guardian. The country also deployed police officers in addition to military troops, and together they totaled about 800,000 across 85,000 polling stations, Al Jazeera reported.
Preliminary election results
Polls closed at 6 p.m. local time. With approximately 10 to 15 percent of votes counted, local TV channels were projecting the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party to win between 94 and 102 seats in the national assembly, according to Al Jazeera. The national assembly has a total of 342 seats, with 272 directly elected. A majority coalition selects the next prime minister.
At 12:19 a.m. local time Thursday, leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, Shehbaz Sharif, tweeted that his party “wholly rejects the results of General Elections 2018 due to manifest  unacceptable!”
There are 30 active political parties participating in the elections for both national and provincial assemblies.
Elections and political parties
The PML-N has been in power since 2013 and its chairman is Shehbaz Sharif, brother of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. While campaigning, Shehbaz Sharif said his party had helped Pakistan while in power, for example, by fixing power shortages in the country that had previously resulted in intermittent day-long blackouts. 
Former international cricket player Imran Khan formed the PTI party and has called former Prime Minister Sharif an agent of India, according to The Guardian. He has also spoken in support of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, which mandate the death penalty in certain cases of blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad. Pakistan’s population is more than 96 percent Muslim, according to the country’s statistics bureau. 
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, 29, leads the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which The Guardian describes as “historically liberal.”
The PML-N, which said it “wholly rejects” the preliminary election results, said the military, in its deployment to polling stations, may have interfered in the election in favor of the PTI party. PML-N alleged that the military interfered because former PML-N Prime Minister Sharif had attempted to reduce the military’s power before he was removed from office by the supreme court last July. The court ruled he had failed to report income from a company his son owned, which Sharif denied.
Campaigning was suspended as of midnight Monday, in accordance with Pakistani law. Shehbaz Sharif and Khan campaigned in Punjab province that day. Voters in that province will determine 141 of the 272 contested national assembly seats.
About 106 million Pakistanis were registered to vote in the country, 59 million (56 percent) of whom are male. More than 12,570 candidates were running, 3,765 of whom were running for the national assembly, according to Al Jazeera. Voter turnout in the 2013 elections was 55 percent. The minimum voting age is 18.
In addition to the 272 contested national assembly seats, 60 of the 342 total seats are reserved for women and 10 for non-Muslims. Those seats will be decided by proportional representation, chosen from “political parties' lists of candidates on the basis of total number of general seats secured by each political party,” according to the country’s constitution. Voting for the other seats of the national assembly follows a “first-past-the-post” system in which the winner of the most votes in a district with one assembly seat wins the seat, even if that candidate did not win a majority of the votes, according to the Library of Congress.

40496,2018-07-27,Thousands protest in Poland after new law gives government power over Supreme Court appointments,"On Thursday, Polish demonstrators protested a new law that grants the government more power over court appointments, including the effective ability to choose the next head of the Supreme Court. Thousands of people protested in more than 20 cities and towns after Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the bill into law Thursday. The ruling party said the reforms are necessary to “serve” Polish citizens. 
In the capital city of Warsaw, protesters in front of the presidential palace chanted “shame” and “free courts,” and sang the national anthem. Police used pepper spray against protesters in some instances, Reuters reported. Warsaw police spokesman Sylwester Marczak said that someone in the crowd “used gas against police officers,” and that “due to the threat, one of the policemen also used a hand-held gas device.”
The Law and Justice (PiS) party, which holds a majority in parliament, says Poland’s judiciary was not reformed properly after the end of communist governance in 1989. PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński said, “Without [judiciary] reforms, we cannot rebuild the Polish state so that it serves its citizens.” 
Judicial reforms
Since 2015 when PiS won its majority, the party began a series of judicial reforms. Dozens of judges were removed from the country’s Constitutional Tribunal, which examines certain constitutional complaints, and the National Judiciary Council, the body responsible for making judicial appointments, Reuters reported.
Earlier this month, 22 of the 73 judges on Poland’s Supreme Court were removed from their positions due to a new law that enforces a retirement age of 64. Supreme Court Chief Justice Malgorzata Gersdorf has refused to leave her job, arguing that her constitutional term runs until 2020. 
Last year, Poland received warnings from the European Commission for its plans to reform its judicial system. The EU said that 13 new laws in Poland over two years have allowed the government to “interfere significantly” in the judiciary.
In December, the Commission invoked disciplinary measures under Article 7 of the EU treaties and has begun a “rule-of-law investigation.” Poland’s voting rights in the European Council could possibly be suspended as a result of these measures.
The Polish government says EU treaties do not provide the European Commission with authority over national matters such as the judiciary. “Let me mention a fundamental issue,” said Kaczyński. “The court system … is an entirely internal matter.”
Extradition ruling
On Wednesday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld an Irish court ruling that Ireland could refuse to extradite a Polish suspect accused of drug offences under a European arrest warrant, if the Irish judiciary determines the suspect may not receive a fair trial in Poland. Other EU countries potentially may use the ECJ ruling as a basis to reject other Polish arrest and extradition warrants, according to BBC.

40489,2018-07-27,"Northern California wildfire kills 2 firefighters, destroys 65 buildings","A wildfire in northern California has killed two firefighters and destroyed 65 buildings as of Friday, Cal Fire officials said. Thousands of residents have left the area under an evacuation order. The fire, called the Carr Fire, started Monday and tripled in size over Thursday night, to 45 square miles (115 square kilometers). Cal Fire attributed the spread to triple-digit temperatures, low humidity and windy conditions. 
A firefighter with the Redding Fire Department was killed on Friday, officials said, the second of the Carr Fire. On Thursday night, crews also found the body of a bulldozer operator who had been hired to clear vegetation in the fire’s path, confirmed Scott McLean, a Cal Fire spokesman. The deceased have not been publicly identified. 
McLean said that three firefighters and several civilians had also been injured by the fires. 
The Carr Fire is believed to have been started by a mechanical issue with a vehicle near Whiskeytown, about 30 miles west of Redding, according to Cal Fire. It spread through neighboring communities and then wind pushed it across the Sacramento River into the city of Redding, with a population of about 92,000, on Thursday. 
Evacuation orders are in place for more than 37,000 residents of Shasta County, where Redding is located. Some residents have moved to hotels, homes of family members elsewhere, or a shelter outside of town, The Associated Press reported. Shasta College and Weaverville Elementary School set up evacuation centers, according to SFGate news outlet. 
“Really, we’re in a life-saving mode right now in Redding,” said Cal Fire unit chief Jonathan Cox. “We’re not fighting a fire. We’re trying to move people out of the path of it because it is now deadly, and it is now moving at speeds and in ways we have not seen before in this area.”
The Mercy Medical Center, a hospital in Redding, was preparing high-risk patients to be evacuated, but did not yet plan to move them, a spokesman said. It did evacuate five babies from its neonatal intensive care unit.
As of Friday, the Carr Fire had burned 44,450 acres and was 3 percent contained. Officials from the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said nearly 5,000 homes were at risk of burning, in addition to the 55 that were destroyed and another 55 that were damaged. 
Temperatures are forecast to be around 110 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend, with humidity as low as 10 percent, National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Gurth said, which could increase the spread of the fire. “We might be seeing some considerable fire growth if that cycle continues, which it looks like it will,” he said.
More than 1,700 personnel are working to contain the fire, including those servicing 10 engines, 10 helicopters and 22 bulldozers. California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the county on Thursday, which allows state agencies, such as the Office of Emergency Services, to direct resources to the local government.
The Carr Fire is one of dozens of wildfires currently burning in California, including one outside Yosemite National Park that killed a heavy equipment operator earlier this month, and the Cranston Fire to the south, from which 3,000 residents have been evacuated.

40487,2018-07-27,Trump denies advance knowledge of 2016 meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer,"President Donald Trump said Friday he did not have prior knowledge of a June 2016 meeting attended by his son Donald Trump Jr., Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others, following a CNN report that Michael Cohen has alleged Trump was aware of it in advance. 

Unnamed sources told CNN that former Trump attorney Cohen was present when his client was informed of the meeting. They said that Cohen does not have evidence of the conversation, but is willing to attest to the events in court. Trump tweeted that he did not know about the meeting, and suggested that Cohen was making it up “in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam.”
The meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times in July of last year, was to introduce Trump Jr. to someone who had “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia,” according to an email invitation Trump Jr. made public last year. 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly asked Trump’s legal team about the meeting, according to a list of questions that The New York Times published in April. The Times reported that Mueller, who is leading an investigation into alleged Russian election interference and possible coordination between Russia and Trump’s presidential campaign, submitted a question for Trump to his legal team about when he became aware of his son’s meeting.
The meeting
The other parties reportedly present at the June 2016 meeting were: British music publicist Rob Goldstone, who according to a Trump Jr. email chain arranged the meeting; then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort; Trump’s son-in-law and now senior presidential adviser Jared Kushner; Russian translator Anatoli Samachornov; and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin.
Trump Jr. said that, during the meeting, Veselnitskaya spoke about “the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act,” and did not offer information about Clinton. (The U.S.’ Magnitsky Act imposed sanctions on Russian individuals suspected of human rights violations, and following its imposition, Russia prohibited the adoption of Russian children by American families.) Veselnitskaya said in an interview that she, Trump Jr., and the others discussed “nothing at all about the presidential campaign” in the meeting. 
Trump tweeted Friday, “.....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary’s lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!”
Cohen under investigation
Cohen, one of Trump’s former personal attorneys, is under investigation for his “personal business dealings,” according to the Justice Department. In April, FBI agents raided his home and office, executing a search warrant for documents about his $130,000 payment to former adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, stage name Stormy Daniels, for signing a non-disclosure agreement regarding her alleged 2006 extramarital affair with Trump. Trump has denied the affair. 
The search warrant also requested documents relating to Cohen’s ownership of New York City taxi medallions. Cohen has not been charged with a crime in the case. 
Cohen has retained lawyer Lanny Davis, who represented the Clintons in the 1990s. When contacted by CNN, Davis declined to comment on the reports that Cohen has alleged Trump knew of the June 2016 meeting.

40485,2018-07-27,US reports 4.1 percent annual GDP growth in Q2,"U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, according to “advance” figures released by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on Friday. The Q2 figure, representing annually adjusted growth from April to June, increased from the first quarter’s adjusted rate of 2.2 percent. The second quarter showed the fastest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2014, when the economy grew 4.9 percent.
The BEA reported that the increase in GDP growth “reflected accelerations in PCE [personal consumption expenditures] and in exports, a smaller decrease in residential fixed investment, and accelerations in federal government spending and in state and local spending.”
Consumer spending, the PCE figure, accelerated to a 4 percent annual growth rate in Q2, up from 0.5 percent in Q1. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. 
Exports increased 9.3 percent in Q2, while imports grew 0.5 percent. The Trump administration introduced new tariffs on foreign products in Q2, and foreign countries, such as China, announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, including soybeans. This led some consumers in other countries to purchase an increased quantity of soybeans in anticipation of foreign taxes on the product, accounting for some of the increases in exports, The Washington Post reported. 
Second quarter business investment also grew 7.3 percent, and government spending increased at a 2.1 percent rate.
President Donald Trump called the numbers “amazing” and “very sustainable,” in an unscheduled press conference outside the White House on Friday morning. “We’re going to get a lot higher than these numbers and these are great numbers.” 
During the 2016 presidential campaign, he pledged to double GDP growth to above 4 percent. “My Administration remains very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth — that’s what we’re all about,” Trump said, according to the White House. 
The Associated Press reported that some analysts predicted that Q3 growth will decrease to about 3 percent.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has forecast annual growth will be 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent in 2019 and 2 percent in 2020. Its forecast is based, in part, on a gradual decrease in economic stimulus created by tax cuts and government spending. 
Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, predicted that “growth will slow markedly from mid-2019 onwards,” citing the same factors as the Fed, plus a possible rise in federal interest rates. He also said that the 2.8 percent growth over the past year “is a bit better than it has done recently, but is in no way the strongest growth during this expansion.”
The bureau’s Q2 figures are based on preliminary data available, and a second, revised set of figures is scheduled to be released on Aug. 29, the BEA said.

40413,2018-07-27,PTI party wins most Pakistan national assembly seats; Khan says party ‘successful’ and ‘got a mandate’,"On Thursday, PTI party leader Imran Khan gave a speech a day after Pakistan’s elections for the national assembly. He said, ""We have been successful and got a mandate,” adding, ""I think this has been the clearest, fairest election Pakistan has ever had.” The Electoral Commission’s preliminary results had the PTI party winning 107 of the 272 national assembly seats contested. The ruling PML-N party said earlier it “wholly rejects” the results due to “manifest” and “massive irregularities.” 
Other parties have also rejected the election results, alleging vote rigging and manipulation, BBC reported. On Thursday, Pakistan's Dawn Newspaper said the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan “received complaints that in many areas women were not allowed to vote.” Khan said he would investigate any claims that there was vote rigging.
At least 203 people were killed in violence leading up to the election, Al Jazeera reported. While polling stations were open Wednesday, a suicide bomber killed at least 31 people and injured more than 40 others in Quetta.
Wednesday’s election is only the second time in Pakistan’s history that a new civilian government has been elected after the previous one served a full term, according to BBC. The country has been periodically ruled by the military over its 71-year history.
AFP reported that voter turnout was estimated at 50 to 55 percent of 106 million registered voters. The Electoral Commission’s preliminary results had PML-N winning 57 seats and the PPP party 29. A total of 137 seats is required for a majority. The PTI party would have to form a coalition to rule and select a prime minister.
In his speech, Khan spoke of a “mutually beneficial” relation with the U.S. and said he would hold talks with India over the disputed Kashmir region. He said Pakistan should have a “kind of humanitarian state, where we take responsibility for our weaker classes.” 
Khan called for all of Pakistan to “unite” and said, “The biggest challenge we are facing is the economic crisis ... we have never had such a huge fiscal deficit.” He added, “We need to make an atmosphere for doing business.” He also discussed unemployment and helping small businesses, and said his party would “strengthen [its] anti-corruption institutions.” He said the country would work to maintain and improve relations with Pakistan’s neighbors, including China, Afghanistan, Iran and India.

40411,2018-07-27,"Government reunites at least 1,442 children with undocumented parents; 711 more ineligible by deadline","On Thursday, the U.S. government said it had reunited 1,442 immigrant children with their detained, undocumented parents. An additional 378 children had been released under “appropriate circumstances,” such as to a parent who was already released in the U.S., or a family member or friend who could act as a caretaker. Thursday was a court-imposed deadline for the reunifications. The government said 711 children were ineligible to be reunited with parents by the deadline, for reasons such as parents no longer being in the U.S. 
The 378 children released under “appropriate circumstances” also included those who had turned 18 and could be released as adults.
Parents who were reunited with their children may have included those who crossed into the U.S. illegally, as well as those who crossed at a legal border crossing and requested asylum due to violence in their native countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, BBC reported.
Of the 711 children ineligible to be reunited with parents by the deadline, the government said there were 120 children whose parents declined reunions, 431 children whose parents were no longer in the U.S., 79 whose parents had been released from custody in the U.S. and had not been located for reunions, 94 whose parents’ locations were under review, 21 whose parents were ineligible for being reunited due to their background check results, 46 ineligible for other reasons, and 7 children who were affected by a separate court case, CNN reported. The numbers add up to more than 711 children, since some had multiple reasons for not being reunited.
On June 26, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to reunite all separated migrant children with their parents by this Thursday. 
Some of the separations resulted from the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy,” announced in April, which called for all adults who illegally crossed the border to be prosecuted. Trump later signed an executive order to end the separations on June 20, ordering authorities to detain “alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.”
The government said in its Thursday court filing to Sabraw, “The reunification plan outlined to the Court ... is proceeding, and is expected to result in the reunification of all class members found eligible for reunification at this time by the Court's July 26, 2018 deadline.”
Chris Meekins, chief of staff for the Department of Health and Human Services’ preparedness and response division, said, “We expect to be able to reunify all eligible parents who were within ICE custody this evening by the court order.”
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Lee Gelernt said, “I think it's accurate to say [the government] didn't meet the deadline, the only deadline they met is their self-defined deadline.”
Matthew Albence, chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE’s) enforcement division, said ICE has been working “24/7” on the reunification process. He said, “ICE and especially [Enforcement and Removal Operations] has made a concerted effort and dedicated an inordinate amount of resources to ensure these reunifications did occur. The overall first guiding principle is the safety of these children.”
“Parents that did return [to their] home [country] without their child did so after being provided an opportunity to have that child accompany them,” Albence said, adding the parents ""declined"" that option. “Yes, they've been deported. We don't keep track of individuals once they've been deported to foreign countries, as Chris indicated,” Albence said. 
Albence also said, “We cannot force a parent to take a child with them.” He said the government will “work with the court ... should these individuals want reunification.”
The ACLU has filed multiple affidavits that allege some parents did not know what they were signing when they signed documents waiving their right to be reunited with their children.

40408,2018-07-27,Facebook holds earnings call; next day stock decreases by 19%,"Facebook held its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday at 5 p.m. EDT, after markets had closed for the day. Revenue increased 42 percent to $13.2 billion for the second quarter. Analysts had projected $13.3 billion. CFO David Wehner said the company expected its operating margins to “trend towards the mid-30s on a percentage basis” over the next “several” years, down from the second quarter’s 44 percent. Facebook (FB) stock ended Thursday down 41.24 points (18.96 percent) at $176.26 per share. 
The stock had closed the previous day at a record high of $217.50, up 23 percent from the year’s start. 
The first quarter of 2015 was the last time the company missed revenue estimates, according to Bloomberg. Wehner said revenue growth rates would decline in the second half of 2018 due to currency “headwinds,” providing users more data privacy choices and greater investments in products like Instagram’s Stories that have “lower levels of monetization.”
The company’s margin decreased to 44 percent, compared to 47 percent in the second quarter a year ago. The company reported earnings of $1.74 per share, which exceeded analysts’ expectations of $1.72 per share.
Facebook said it had 2.23 billion active monthly users, with 1.47 billion daily active users in June, up 11 percent from last year. The median analyst projection for the end of the second quarter was 1.48 billion daily active users. Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada remained at 185 million, and in Europe declined by 1 percent from 282 to 279 million. The 22 million daily active users Facebook added in the second quarter was down from the 41 million it added in the second quarter of 2017.
Facebook owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, which combine with Facebook to host a total of 2.5 billion monthly users, the company said. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Instagram had grown twice as fast as it would have, if it were not acquired by Facebook in 2012 for about $1 billion in cash and stock. He did not explain how he arrived at that number. 
Wehner said the company “putting privacy first” will likely “have some impact on revenue growth.” He said complying with new European data protection regulations would have a “modest impact” on growth. The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in Europe in the second quarter “to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches.” Facebook then asked European users to check their privacy settings on the site, and noted it had fewer daily users in Europe after the regulation took effect.
Wehner said the company will invest “billions of dollars per year” in improving the safety and security of its product, and that “we think that’s the right thing to do for the business.”
“We plan to grow and promote certain engaging experiences like [Instagram’s] Stories that currently have lower levels of monetization, and we are also giving people who use our services more choices around data privacy, which may have an impact on our revenue growth,” Wehner said.
Facebook said it would increase investments in video content, artificial intelligence and virtual reality. It also said it had 30,275 employees worldwide as of June 30, up 47 percent from last year.
Before the earnings call, Wall Street analysts had issued 44 buy ratings, two sells and two hold ratings on the company’s stock. The median target price was $219.30. At least 16 analysts decreased their price targets for Facebook’s stock after the call, Reuters reported. 
Issues facing the company
In April, Zuckerberg testified before the U.S. House and Senate committees, apologizing for the company not doing “enough” to prevent Facebook from being used for “harm” resulting from “fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech.” He also spoke about privacy issues, including data from as many as 87 million users having been “improperly shared” with Cambridge Analytica, a company that used the data to aid the election campaigns of its clients, including Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz. 
One investor has filed a proposal to remove Zuckerberg as CEO, citing “mishandling” of multiple issues at the company, Fortune reported. 
In April, Facebook announced data policy changes in response to the Cambridge Analytica data sharing. In May, Facebook implemented new rules for political advertisers to verify their identities to “help prevent future interference in elections on Facebook.”
Before the earnings report, Zuckerberg had a net worth of $82.5 billion, which decreased to $67.1 billion after the stock price decline Thursday, according to Forbes. Facebook’s market cap decreased by about $119 billion in a day.

40400,2018-07-27,Japan executes 6 members of group behind 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack,"On Thursday, Japan announced it had executed by hanging the remaining six members of the Aum Shinrikyo religious group who had been on death row. The group was responsible for the 1995 sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system that killed 13 people and injured more than 5,500. Japan hanged seven other convicted group members, including its leader Shoko Asahara, about three weeks ago. 
On March 20, 1995, the group released sarin gas in Tokyo subway cars. Five group members used sharpened umbrella tips to puncture plastic bags of sarin on three different subway lines that were scheduled to arrive at Kasumigaseki station within four minutes of each other, according to CNN. Within seconds, some victims were choking and vomiting, and some blinded and paralyzed. 
On Thursday, Japanese Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa said the “extremely heinous” crimes committed by the group had been “carefully organized and planned,” and that attacks of this size “should never happen again.” She said the attack was “indiscriminate terrorism against the public that shocked the world.”
Asahara’s death sentence had been set since 2006, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. The other 12 group members’ appeals were exhausted in January 2018. Asahara, whose real name is Chizuo Matsumoto, never acknowledged his responsibility for the attacks during an eight-year trial, according to The Associated Press.
The six men executed Thursday included four who were involved in the subway train attack. Two others, one of whom recruited people into the group, were convicted of other crimes, including involvement in the 1994 attack, and the 1989 murder of a lawyer and his family. The lawyer had a class action lawsuit against the group, CNN reported. Some of the six men were also involved in the production of deadly chemicals.
Authorities also found Aum Shinrikyo responsible for a June 1994 sarin gas attack in Matsumoto that killed eight and injured more than 500. The group released sarin from a truck while driving around an apartment complex, CNN reported. Aum Shinrikyo was accused of being responsible for 27 deaths. Authorities raided its headquarters near Mount Fuji in 1995, and captured Asahara about two months later.
Members of the group believed the world was going to end in a global war, and that anyone who was not part of the group would go to hell unless group members killed them, according to BBC. 
After the Tokyo sarin attack, group members attempted and failed to release hydrogen cyanide in some train stations, BBC reported.
Asahara started Aum Shinrikyo, whose name means “supreme truth,” in 1984. Japan granted it official status as a religious organization in 1989. At one point, the group had 10,000 members in Japan and 30,000 in Russia. 
About 2,000 people are members of three groups that formed after Aum Shinrikyo was broken up, according to AP. At least two of those groups are legal in Japan, with designations as “dangerous religions” that may be subject to surveillance. The U.S. and other countries have designated Aum Shinrikyo a terrorist organization.
Executions in Japan are performed in secret, with prisoners given less than a day’s notice, according to Amnesty International. There are currently 110 people on death row in Japan, with 88 of those appealing their cases, CNN reported.

40647,2018-07-30,Zimbabweans vote in first election without Mugabe on ballot,"Zimbabweans voted on Monday for a new president, in the first election since Robert Mugabe resigned from office last year after a military coup took over the government. Voters will choose from 23 candidates, including 19 men and 4 women, all running for the first time.
The ballot includes current President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over the presidency after Mugabe’s 37-year rule, and the leader of the main opposition party, Nelson Chamisa. Mugabe had been in power since Zimbabwe gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1980, ending white minority rule.
If no single candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote, a runoff election will be held on Sept. 8 between the top two candidates. Official results are due to be released this Saturday.
Voting began at 7 a.m. local time, with some voters lining up as early as 5:30 a.m. at the country’s 10,985 polling stations. Polls are scheduled to be open for 12 hours, until 7 p.m.
More than 5.6 million Zimbabweans are registered to vote, including about 43.5 percent under the age of 35. The landlocked southern African country’s total population is about 16 million.
For the first time since 2012, Zimbabwe permitted election observers from the U.S. and the European Union to monitor the vote. As of Monday morning, no violence or major voting irregularities were reported. Rights groups have alleged there was state-sponsored vote-buying and intimidation leading up to the election, the Post reported.
Candidates
Mnangagwa, 75, of the ruling ZANU-PF party, and Chamisa, 40, of the MDC alliance opposition party, have led in the polls. Mnangagwa served in Mugabe’s Cabinet for decades, before coordinating with the military to remove the president from power. 
Chamisa is a former activist who led protests against Mugabe in 1999, and later joined the MDC (formally called the Movement for Democratic Change). He took over party leadership in February after the previous leader died of cancer. If elected, Chamisa would be the youngest leader in Africa.
Mnangagwa and Chamisa have both promised to increase foreign investment and create jobs. The estimated unemployment rate in the country is as high as 90 percent, BBC reported. At least one million Zimbabweans have migrated to neighboring South Africa in search of work, according to the Post. Other election issues include education and healthcare, according to BBC. 
Mugabe won’t back successor
Mugabe, 94, said he would not vote for or back his successor in the Zanu-PF party, Mnangagwa. Mugabe repeated that he was “sacked” in the coup from the “party he founded,” and left office in order to “avoid conflict.”
“I can't vote for ZANU-PF. I can't vote for those in power. I can't vote for those who brought me into this state,” he said in the previously unannounced speech from his home in the capital city of Harare on Sunday night. He added that he wished Chamisa well, saying he was the only viable candidate.
Mnangagwa alleged that Mugabe made a “deal” with Chamisa. “We can no longer believe that [Mugabe’s] intentions are to transform Zimbabwe and rebuild our nation,"" Mnangagwa said.
Mugabe and Chamisa denied that they have spoken to each other.
Mugabe also denied on Sunday that he planned to have his wife, Grace, take over the party after him, and instead would have recommended that former defense minister Sydney Sekeramayi take over.
Chamisa comments on election delays
Chamisa said that his party would win unless there was election “mischief.” He tweeted that “there seems to be a deliberate attempt to suppress and frustrate the Urban vote,” and that “the people’s will” was being negated due to “deliberate” and “unnecessary delays.”
According to an opinion poll last week cited by BBC, the second of only two such polls, Chamisa’s MDC party was 3 percentage points behind the Zanu-PF. Twenty percent of voters were undecided.

40614,2018-07-30,"At least 14 killed, more than 160 injured in earthquake on Lombok island, Indonesia","At least 14 people were killed and 162 injured in a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on the island of Lombok, Indonesia, on Sunday. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency, said more than 1,000 homes had been damaged by the earthquake. Nugroho said the majority of casualties, which occurred in the northern and eastern districts of Lombok, were caused by debris and falling concrete blocks. Nugroho said, “the main focus now is on evacuation and rescue.”
The earthquake occurred at about 6:47 a.m. local time Sunday, with the epicenter at a depth of 4.6 miles (7.5 km) in northern Lombok, about 31 miles (50 km) northeast of Mataram, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Jean Paul Volchaert, owner of The Puncak Hotel on Lombok, told CNN there was about 20 seconds of shaking after he was awoken by the earthquake, and that he felt the aftershocks for about two hours. 
Hiking at the island’s Mt. Rinjani was suspended due to landslides, according to the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. A Malaysian citizen who had been hiking there was one of those killed, BBC reported.

40611,2018-07-30,Trump tweets about meeting with NYT publisher; Times issues statement on meeting,"On July 20, President Donald Trump and New York Times’ publisher A.G. Sulzberger met at the White House in what Trump’s aides reportedly had requested be an off-the-record meeting. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he and Sulzberger “spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media.” Sulzberger later said he met with Trump “to raise concerns about the president’s deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric.” Trump then tweeted that freedom of the press comes with a responsibility to report the news accurately.
Mercedes Schlapp, a White House communications adviser, confirmed the meeting took place, saying, “The president regularly meets with members of the media.”
Trump’s tweet about the meeting
On Sunday morning, Trump tweeted, “Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media  how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, ‘Enemy of the People.’ Sad!”
Sulzberger’s response
Two hours later, the Times published a statement by A.G. Sulzberger “in response to President Trump’s tweet about their meeting.” It said James Bennet, who oversees the Times’ editorial page, had accompanied Sulzberger to the meeting. The Times said the request by the president’s aides that the meeting be off the record “has also been the practice for such meetings [with presidents] in the past.” The Times added, “with Mr. Trump’s tweet this morning, he has put the meeting on the record, so A.G. has decided to respond to the president’s characterization of their conversation, based on detailed notes A.G. and James took.”
After referencing Trump’s “anti-press rhetoric,” Sulzberger wrote, “I told the president directly that I thought that his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous.
“I told him that although the phrase ‘fake news’ is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists ‘the enemy of the people.’ I warned that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence.
“I repeatedly stressed that this is particularly true abroad, where the president’s rhetoric is being used by some regimes to justify sweeping crackdowns on journalists. I warned that it was putting lives at risk, that it was undermining the democratic ideals of our nation, and that it was eroding one of our country’s greatest exports: a commitment to free speech and a free press.
“Throughout the conversation I emphasized that if President Trump, like previous presidents, was upset with coverage of his administration he was of course free to tell the world. I made clear repeatedly that I was not asking for him to soften his attacks on The Times if he felt our coverage was unfair. Instead, I implored him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism, which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country.”
Sulzberger, who took over from his father as the Times’ publisher on Jan. 1, described his meeting with Trump as “cordial,” the outlet reported. He said by meeting’s end he felt Trump had listened to his arguments. He said the president told him he was glad that Sulzberger had brought up the issues and that he would think about them. Sulzberger said he “bore no illusions” that Trump would reduce his media criticism after their discussion, according to the Times.
The outlet also reported that Sulzberger told Trump that newspapers were starting to post armed guards outside of their offices due to increased threats against journalists. Trump expressed surprise that media outlets did not already have armed guards there.
Trump’s later tweets
Sunday afternoon, Trump said over multiple tweets, “When the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk! Very unpatriotic! Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news…...accurately. 90% of media coverage of my Administration is negative, despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving, it’s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low! I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the…...dying newspaper industry. No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people! As an example, the failing New York Times…...and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change!”
Past Trump comments
Trump has tweeted the phrase “enemy of the people” in reference to the news media before, such as last February, when he tweeted, “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” 
Last week, Trump spoke to veterans in Kansas City, Missouri, saying, “Stick with us. Don’t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.”
Presidents have met with the Times’ publishers and editors in the past. Sulzberger’s father, then-publisher of the Times, told then-President Bill Clinton that he thought of the paper’s editorials as “tough love,” according to Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones, who have written a history of the Sulzberger family. Clinton reportedly replied, “Well, just don’t forget the love part.”

40608,2018-07-30,Egyptian court sentences to death 75 who protested in support of former President Morsi,"On Saturday, an Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, for their roles in a 2013 demonstration in support of Mohammed Morsi. Morsi was a former Muslim Brotherhood leader who became the first democratically-elected Egyptian president. The military removed him from power after a year, and army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi became the country’s leader in July 2013. State-run news agency Ahram Online reported Saturday that the Cairo Criminal Court referred the cases to the Grand Mufti for a final decision.
The Grand Mufti is the country’s leading Islamic authority, according to CNN, and must issue a non-binding opinion on any verdict before it can be finalized and the sentence imposed. A criminal court will issue a final verdict on the death sentences on Sept. 8, Ahram Online reported, and that verdict could be appealed.
Those sentenced were part of a sit-in in support of Morsi after el-Sisi removed him from power following protests against Morsi’s rule. Egyptian security forces killed more than 600 pro-Morsi protesters who were demonstrating at Rabaa al-Adawiya and al-Nahda squares in Cairo. Security forces used automatic weapons, armored personnel carriers and military bulldozers while attempting to disperse the crowds in August 2013. 
Those sentenced on Saturday were accused of ""attacking citizens, resisting authorities, destroying public property and buildings, and possessing firearms and Molotov cocktails,"" according to Ahram Online.
The government is prosecuting 739 people for participating in the protests. Of the 75 sentenced to death, 44 are in custody and 31 at large. Sentencing is scheduled for the remaining 664 defendants on Sept. 8, with those sentences subject to appeal. Two of the remaining 664 include photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid and Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie.
Egypt has banned the Muslim Brotherhood and designated it a terrorist organization. 
On Saturday, Amnesty International tweeted, ""No members of the security forces have been held responsible for the violent dispersal of the Rabaa protest."" Last month, the human rights organization said the mass trials for participants in the 2013 sit-in was a “grotesque parody of justice” and called for authorities to drop the charges against those whom it said protested peacefully.

40601,2018-07-30,VICE News reports Twitter search auto-suggest issue; next day ‘appears’ fixed,"On Wednesday, VICE News reported some Twitter accounts were not appearing in auto-populated dropdown search boxes. The outlet said multiple Republicans’ accounts did not auto-populate while multiple Democrats’ accounts did. The next day, VICE said Twitter “appears” to have fixed the issue. Twitter verified this, and said the issue had affected accounts of both Democratic and Republican politicians.
Auto-populated dropdown search boxes appear while a name is being typed into Twitter’s search bar, before “enter” is pressed. 
VICE referred to the auto-populate issue as a “shadow ban” on Republican accounts. Twitter said Thursday it does not “shadow ban,” which it said could be defined as “deliberately making someone’s content undiscoverable to everyone except the person who posted it, unbeknownst to the original poster.”
VICE’s Wednesday article
On Wednesday, VICE reported that if Twitter users typed in the names of certain Republicans or their spokespeople, those Twitter accounts would not auto-populate in the dropdown search box. It said the profiles did appear during a full search using the full name and pressing enter. It also said if one followed a particular account, it appeared to auto-populate in the dropdown search box.
According to VICE, some of the affected accounts included Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesman Andrew Surabian, and the verified profile of Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), whose unverified account did appear to auto-populate.
The accounts of all 78 Congress’ Progressive Caucus members appeared in the auto-populate search box, VICE reported. It said the accounts of Democratic Party chairman Tom Perez and Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) appeared in drop-down search results.
VICE reported the accounts of Infowars, a media outlet that promotes conspiracy theories, its founder Alex Jones and Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) were appearing in auto-populating search boxes. It also reported that the drop-down search bar was not auto-populating for the account of Jason Kessler, who organized the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August. 
Twitter said, “The profiles, Tweets and discussions about” accounts with the auto-populate issue “do appear when you search for them. To be clear, our behavioral ranking doesn’t make judgments based on political views or the substance of Tweets.” A Twitter spokesman also said, “I'd emphasize that our technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.”
In May, the social media company discussed in a blog post a new approach it was taking “to improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter.” It said “we use policies, human review processes, and machine learning to help us determine how Tweets are organized and presented in communal places like conversations and search.” It added, “This technology and our team will learn over time and will make mistakes,” and that “we’ll continue to be open and honest about the mistakes we make and the progress we are making.”
Online media outlet The Daily Dot reported the Twitter auto-populate issue on Tuesday. That afternoon, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted, “A short thread addressing some issues folks are encountering as a result of our conversational health work, specifically the perception of ‘shadowbanning’ based on content or ideology. It suffices to say we have a lot more work to do to earn people’s trust on how we work.”
Responses to VICE’s article
On Wednesday afternoon, Ronna McDaniel tweeted, “The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American. Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on.” She also tweeted a graphic on Wednesday evening showing that her Twitter account was not appearing in the auto-populated dropdown search box when her name was typed into the search box. She did not specify when the graphic was captured.
On Wednesday afternoon, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, “So now @twitter is censoring @GOPChairwoman?,” adding, “[Jack Dorsey] it’s time for you to #StopTheBias against conservatives and Trump supporters and fix this once and for all.”
On Tuesday Gaetz tweeted a link to The Daily Dot article, saying, “Hey @Twitter, are you shadow-banning my twitter account?? It would appear so.”
A spokesman for Gaetz said, “It is curious that these allegations would arise the week following Congressman Gaetz’s heated exchange with Twitter senior executives before the House Judiciary Committee.” On July 17, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing named “Facebook, Google and Twitter: Examining the Content Filtering Practices of Social Media Giants.” During the hearing, Gaetz questioned a Twitter executive on what the company thought its rights were to designate content on its site.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told VICE, “This type of opaque behavior by social media companies is exactly why conservatives are speaking out and demanding more transparency and accountability. The bias has to stop.” 
On Thursday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted, “Twitter ‘SHADOW BANNING’ prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.”
Twitter’s Thursday response
On Thursday, Twitter published a blog post saying it did not “shadow ban” accounts and added, “You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile). And we certainly don’t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology.” 
Twitter said Wednesday that it “identified an issue where some accounts weren’t auto-suggested in search even when people were searching for their specific name.” It added that as of Wednesday afternoon, “this issue was resolved.”
Twitter said the auto-populate issue affected hundreds of thousands of accounts and that the accounts of “Democratic politicians” were also impacted. The social media company said it believed the issue with accounts of some Republican representatives “had more to do with how other people were interacting with these representatives’ accounts than the accounts themselves.” 
It said, “There are communities that try to boost each other’s presence on the platform through coordinated engagement. We believe these types of actors engaged with the representatives’ accounts.” It said this, combined with Twitter’s previous criteria for search auto-suggestions, caused the representatives’ accounts to not show up in auto-suggestions. It said it would work to “better detect these situations and correct for them.”
Twitter said it ranks tweets and search results, and that ranking models “take many signals into consideration to best organize tweets for timely relevance,” adding that it “must also address bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation.” It gave an example of a search result having 30,000 tweets, and provided the criteria it would consider in its search ranking, which included that tweets from “people you’re interested in” should rank highly, tweets that are “popular” should be ranked higher, and tweets “from bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or divide the conversation” should be ranked lower. 
The company provided some “signals” it uses to determine “bad-faith actors”:

	“Specific account properties that indicate authenticity (e.g. whether you have a confirmed email address, how recently your account was created, whether you uploaded a profile image, etc.).”
	“What actions you take on Twitter (e.g. who you follow, who you retweet, etc.).”
	“How other accounts interact with you (e.g. who mutes you, who follows you, who retweets you, who blocks you, etc.)”

Twitter said, “We know this approach is working because we see fewer abuse reports and spam reports.”

40722,2018-07-31,Cambodia's ruling party to form new government in September; ‘principal opposition party’ excluded from election,"Cambodia’s ruling party said on Tuesday that it would meet Sept. 25 or 26 to form a new government with a new cabinet, after announcing the day before that it would win all 125 parliamentary seats in the country’s Sunday general election. The party, the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP), said it won 77.5 percent of the vote. On Sunday, the U.S. called the vote “flawed,” saying it excluded the country’s “principal opposition party.” 

Cambodia’s supreme court dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last November over a complaint the party was working with the U.S. to overthrow the government. The CPP, which filed the complaint with the supreme court, said it was based on “credible evidence.” It added that candidates from 19 other parties ran in the election.
“We cannot forgive those who want to overthrow the government,” said Sok Eysan, spokesman for CPP, in response to the supreme court dissolving CNRP. “You cannot blame the CPP.”
Official election results have not yet been announced. Election workers said voter turnout was more than 82 percent. “We have worked so hard to achieve this result,” Eysan said. 
The White House said, “The campaign was marred by threats from national and local leaders to punish those choosing not to vote.”
Opposition leaders had called for a boycott of the vote. Some registered voters submitted blank ballots or ones with all parties crossed out as a form of protest, the Post reported. The election commission has said about half a million ballots were invalid. About 7.6 million people voted, Reuters reported.
Last Friday, the government ordered internet service providers to block U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia and Voice of America news websites in the country. Some independent media outlets in the country have closed and journalists have been arrested, BBC reported.
Multiple foreign election observers chose not to monitor the election in Cambodia in order to not give the appearance of validating the election, according to The Washington Post. 
China sent election observers to the country for the first time. The country recently gave Cambodia more than $130 million in military aid, and has also invested billions of dollars in infrastructure projects in the country, the Post reported.
The EU is considering imposing economic sanctions against Cambodia after the election, according to BBC. The EU imports about $4.3 billion worth of textiles and textile-related goods from the country, according to the Post.
The White House said the elections “were neither free nor fair and failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people.” The U.S. added that it may impose more visa restrictions as it did last December on “individuals responsible for undermining Cambodian democracy.” It called on Cambodia to release political prisoners, end the ban on “the political opposition,” and allow independent media and civil society organizations to “fulfill their vital roles unhindered.”
Background on Cambodian elections
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen of the CPP party has been in power since 1985. 
Between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge communists ruled the country and about two million people were estimated to have been killed during that time, BBC reported. Hun Sen was a soldier for the Khmer Rouge and later opposed the group. A war between the Khmer Rouge and Vietnam was followed by the Paris Peace Accords in 1991, and the U.N. administered the country’s first election two years later. The U.S. and EU gave billions of dollars in aid to Cambodia after the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. They did not provide assistance for Sunday’s election. 
In 2013, the CNRP rejected that year’s general election results and led protests. Last year, the CNRP won about 44 percent of the popular vote in local elections. The party’s 55 members of the National Assembly, which had 123 members at that time, were later removed from office after last November’s supreme court ruling and the government jailed CNRP leader Kem Sokha on a treason charge. After last year’s elections, some of the party’s leadership left the country and lobbied for foreign sanctions to be imposed on the country. 
“The ban of the opposition and the imprisonment of its leader, the shutdown of independent media and civil society and threats on activists had made this election unacceptable before it even began,” CNRP said in a statement. “History will mark [July 29] as the day Hun Sen’s regime invited sanctions and ultimately [will] bring down the Cambodian economy with it.” 
The country has experienced a period of economic growth under Hun Sen, according to BBC.

40651,2018-07-31,India publishes draft citizenship for Assam state,"On Monday, the Registrar General of India published the final draft of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) citizenship list for the state of Assam, which borders Bangladesh in northeast India. The draft excludes approximately four million people who applied for the list and claim to be in the state legally, whom the Assam government claims are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Officials said there would not be immediate deportations of people not on the list, and that excluded people may enter an appeal process, BBC reported. 
The NRC list includes people who can prove they or their ancestors entered Assam state by March 24, 1971, the day before Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan and an armed conflict followed. During that time, about 10 million Bengalis relocated to India, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. 
Bengalis are an ethnic group, who speak a language of the same name. Assam government claims that illegal Bangladeshi immigrants have been living among the legal Bengali population in the state, sometimes using forged papers. 
The updated NRC was compiled as part of the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord, an agreement between the Indian government, the Assam government and Assam groups to remove illegal immigrants from the state. The accord, signed by then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, said those who did not arrive in Assam before March 25, 1971, would not be considered legitimate citizens, and would be deleted from electoral rolls and expelled from the country. 
Criteria for inclusion on the updated citizen list, compiled in accordance the Assam Accord, was that the individual, or his or her ancestors, was on a voter list prior to that date, or was on the NRC when it was last updated in 1951, according to The Hindustan Times. 
Approximately 33 million people (the population of Assam) applied for inclusion on the list, and 29 million have been found eligible, according to the Registrar General of India, Sailesh, who goes by a single name. 
Exclusions from the list
The four million excluded from the list will be able to appeal the decision from Aug. 30 to Sept. 28, according to Sailesh. An initial draft version of the list was released in December, under the supervision of India’s Supreme Court, according to the government. The final list will not be published until all appeals have been processed, according to officials cited by NPR. 
Those not included on the citizenship list could be taken to detention centers, be deported or obtain long-term work permits without land ownership and political rights, according to The Hindustan Times.
“Everyone will be given a right to prove their citizenship,” Assam’s law minister, Siddhartha Bhattacharya, told the BBC. “But if they fail to do so, well, the legal system will take its own course.” When the reported asked if he meant the people would be “expelled,” the minister said, “yes.” 
Bangladesh, which received hundred of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar last year, has not publicly said it would accept new refugees from Assam, BBC reported.
Allegations of bias
Some activists have alleged that the NCR is intentionally designed to remove Bengalis, a majority of whom are Muslim, from the Hindu-majority state. Bengali campaigner Nazrul Ali Ahmed alleged, “They are openly threatening to get rid of Muslims, and what happened to the Rohingya in Myanmar could happen to us here.”
Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the list was “completely impartial” adding, “some people are unnecessarily trying to create an atmosphere of fear.”
Prateek Hajela, who is in charge of the NCR, said in a statement the list makes “no differentiation on the basis of religion or language” in determining citizenship, in accordance with the law.

40666,2018-07-31,Investigators report flight MH370 disappearance ‘probably resulted from manual inputs’,"Malaysian government investigators published their report on the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 (MH370), saying the plane’s departure from its scheduled flight path “probably resulted from manual inputs.” The investigators ruled out other possible explanations such as aircraft malfunction, remote control of the plane’s operation systems and the pilot’s mental state.
Kok Soo Chon, head of the investigation team, said, “we are not of the opinion it could have been an event committed by the pilots.” He added the investigators weren’t ruling out the possibility the “manual inputs” came from the pilot, the co-pilot or “unlawful interference” by a “third person or third party.”
On March 8, 2014, flight MH370 carrying 237 passengers was en route from the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur to China’s capital, Beijing. The last communication recorded from the aircraft was when Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah said, “Good night, Malaysia,” as the plane left Malaysian airspace. At some point after Shah’s communication, the plane went off course and turned back towards Malaysia. 
Malaysian investigators say the plane’s course was “probably” manually changed and the plane’s systems were manually turned off. Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigators said that everyone on MH370 would have been unconscious when the plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the Indian Ocean.
After the plane’s disappearance, Malaysia, China, and Australia carried out a search in a 710,000 square kilometer area of the Indian Ocean. The search was ended in January 2017. A privately funded search from Malaysia was ended in May of this year. The only pieces of the aircraft that have been recovered are three wing fragments. 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad said the country would consider resuming the search for the aircraft if new evidence became available.

40662,2018-07-31,Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she has ‘at least 5 more years’ on Supreme Court,"On Sunday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she thinks she has “at least five more years” on the court before retirement. Ginsburg, 85, was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The average retirement age of the last 11 justices was 80, according to The Washington Post. 
“I’m now 85,” Ginsburg said. “My senior colleague, Justice John Paul Stevens, he stepped down when he was 90, so think I have about at least five more years.” 
Justice Anthony Kennedy, 82, announced last month he would retire effective July 31. President Donald Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy, sending his nomination to the Senate for the approval process. 
Ginsburg was speaking in New York during a question-and-answer period after a production of “The Originalist,” an Off-Broadway play about the late Justice Antonin Scalia. In answering a question about people recently questioning the country’s institutions, she responded, “My dear spouse used to say the true symbol of the U.S. is not a bald eagle. It is the pendulum,” adding “ when it goes very far in one direction, you can count on it coming back.”
“The genius of the constitution is it has become more and more inclusive,” she also said on Sunday while discussing the issue of discrimination. “Now, ‘we the people’, embraces all the people.”
Supreme Court appointments
The Supreme Court is made up of the chief justice and eight associate justices, appointed for life terms. The president has the authority to nominate the justices and the appointment is confirmed with the approval of the Senate, determined by a majority vote.

Elena Kagan, 58, Associate Justice, was nominated by then-President Barack Obama and took her seat on Aug. 7, 2010.
Trump’s Supreme Court nominations
After Kennedy announced his retirement, President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, 53, is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. Kavanaugh is meeting with senators as part of the confirmation process. 
On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he had met with Kavanaugh and would vote for his confirmation. He had previously said he was “undecided.”
In January of last year, Trump nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court to fill the seat left vacant after Scalia’s death in February 2016. Gorsuch was sworn in on April 10, 2017, after the Senate approved his nomination.

40754,2018-08-01,At least 15 killed as gunmen attack Jalalabad government building in Afghanistan (Update),"At least 15 people were killed and 15 wounded in an attack at a government compound in an eastern Afghanistan city on Tuesday, Nangarhar provincial government spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said. A suicide bomber attacked the entrance of the refugees and repatriations directorate compound in the city of Jalalabad. Two gunmen then entered the building, reportedly taking hostages and battling security forces for six hours before the gunmen were killed. The Islamic State militant group later claimed responsibility for the attack. 
A car containing explosives drove up to the compound at around 11 a.m. local time. Two gunmen got out and set off “the first of several explosions, then Afghan Special Forces arrived and a gun battle ensued for the following six hours,” Al Jazeera correspondent Charlotte Bellis reported. A witness named Obaidullah said that minutes after the gunmen entered the building, the car they pulled up in exploded. The building also caught fire during the attack, according to Reuters.
Other attacks
In a separate incident Tuesday, at least 11 people were killed and 37 more wounded when a passenger bus drove over a roadside bomb in the city of Farah, officials said. Al Jazeera’s Bellis said the government said the Taliban was responsible for the attack. The Taliban did not immediately claim responsibility.
Improvised explosive devices (IEDs), such as those used in the roadside bomb, have caused 232 deaths and 645 injuries in Afghanistan in the first half of 2018, according to Al Jazeera. 
On Saturday, attackers entered a training center for midwives in Jalalabad and battled government forces there for nearly six hours. Two people were killed in that attack. 
On Monday, Nangarhar provincial health officials said attacks in the province in the past three months had killed at least 160 people, and more than 490 had been wounded.
U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001, following the 9/11 attacks. In June, the Afghan government declared a temporary ceasefire with the Taliban and the Taliban responded by declaring a ceasefire with the government for three days. Other militant groups are also active in Afghanistan, such as the Islamic State (IS).

40759,2018-08-01,Manafort trial for alleged financial crimes begins,"The Virginia trial of Paul Manafort, a former campaign chairman to President Donald Trump, for alleged financial crimes began on Tuesday. The jury was selected, opening statements were heard and testimony began in a trial the judge said was expected to not last more than three weeks. 

The trial is the first to result from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and “related matters,” but the charges against Manafort are not related to the alleged interference.  One of the prosecutors said, “I don’t anticipate that a government witness will utter the word ‘Russia’” during the trial. 
There are 18 counts against Manafort. The only allegations related to the Trump campaign involved a loan prosecutors say Manafort secured with a bank based on false documents in return for obtaining a position for the bank’s chairman in the Trump campaign.
Manafort is charged with multiple violations of tax and banking laws in the case in Alexandria, Virginia. Manafort is also scheduled to stand trial in Washington in September on related charges. Prosecutors allege, among other things, that he did not pay taxes on all of the nearly $60 million he reportedly earned from lobbying on behalf of Ukrainian politicians, that he hid foreign bank accounts from U.S. authorities and that he lied to banks to take out more than $20 million in loans, according to CNN. Manafort denies the charges and has pled not guilty to all counts.
If found guilty, Manafort could be sentenced to a maximum of 305 years in prison, CNN reported. Manafort’s attorneys have filed motions, which were denied, to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds that Mueller did not have authority to investigate him for crimes unrelated to his work on Trump’s campaign.
In June, a judge revoked Manafort’s bail and house arrest privileges after he was charged with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice for allegedly attempting to influence potential witnesses in his case between February and April. He pled not guilty to those charges and was taken into custody.
Former Trump campaign official Rick Gates, who worked with Manafort prior to joining Trump’s campaign, pled guilty to two financial-related charges in February, after initially pleading not guilty to charges in an indictment last October. After Gates pled guilty to the charges in a Washington court, the Mueller team dropped the charges against him in the Virginia case. Gates was on a list of 35 witnesses prosecutors said they could call in the case. Five witnesses have been granted limited immunity to testify in the case, including Manafort accountants.
Last July, the FBI raided Manafort’s residence in Virginia, seizing documents and property. Some of the seized material may be presented as evidence in the case. 
Manafort’s lawyers wrote the court: ""Evidence or argument relating to Mr. Manafort's work for then-candidate Trump's campaign in 2016 or the Special Counsel's investigation of the campaign's alleged collusion with the Russian government is wholly irrelevant to whether Mr. Manafort's personal income tax returns were false, whether he willfully failed to file reports of foreign accounts, and whether he conspired to commit, or committed, bank fraud.”
The jury in the case is comprised of six men and six women, the majority of them white, with four alternates, three of whom are women.

40732,2018-08-01,"Facebook identifies ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior,’ doesn’t know who’s behind it","On Tuesday, Facebook said it had removed 32 pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram because they were involved in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” in advance of midterm elections, using political content on topics such as fascism, feminism and race. The company said it did not know who was responsible for the inauthentic accounts and would update its post about the situation with “more details when we have them, or if the facts we have change.” 
“We’re still in the very early stages of our investigation and don’t have all the facts — including who may be behind this,” Facebook said. 
Facebook said that about two weeks ago it identified eight pages and 17 profiles on Facebook and seven Instagram accounts that “violate our ban on coordinated inauthentic behavior.” 
Facebook alleged that some of the pages used “VPNs and internet phone services, and paid third parties to run ads on their behalf,” to obscure the identity of the creators or administrators. Additionally, one of the pages had an administrator who was associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency, which the U.S. indicted for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook said it removed that page within minutes.
“This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook because we don’t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they’re doing,” Facebook said. 
The social media company said more than 290,000 total accounts had followed at least one of the pages, with the first one created in March 2017 and the last in May 2018. Facebook has more than 2.23 billion active monthly users.
Pages removed
One of the removed pages promoted an Aug. 10-12 event called “No Unite the Right 2 – D.C.,” a counter-protest to a demonstration planned in Washington by the same group that organized the Charlottesville, Virginia white nationalist protest last August. Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy at Facebook said the company had taken down the posting on Tuesday and informed 2,600 Facebook users who had indicated interest in attending. 
“We are sharing what we know today given the connection between these bad actors and protests that are planned in Washington next week,” Facebook said on Tuesday. 
Facebook also said one post it removed had referred to an event to protest the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE).
The social media company said the most followed Facebook pages it removed were “Aztlan Warriors,” “Black Elevation,” “Mindful Being,” and “Resisters.” Facebook said the remaining pages had no more than 10 followers each and the Instagram accounts had zero followers. 
Facebook said, “We removed all of [the accounts and pages] this [Tuesday] morning once we’d completed our initial investigation and shared the information with U.S. law enforcement agencies, Congress, other technology companies, and the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, a research organization that helps us identify and analyze abuse on Facebook.”
The company also said the accounts ran “about 150 ads for approximately $11,000 on Facebook and Instagram, paid for in U.S. and Canadian dollars. The first ad was created in April 2017, and the last was created in June 2018.”
Link to Russian-associated account
Facebook said an account associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) had been an administrator on the “Resisters” page until Facebook discovered and removed it seven minutes later. 
In February, U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted the IRA, two other companies and 13 Russian nationals for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied ordering an influence campaign on the U.S. election. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed with high confidence that Putin ordered such a campaign.
In April, Facebook said it had removed 70 Facebook accounts, 138 Facebook pages and 65 Instagram accounts that it said were “controlled” by the IRA. 
On Tuesday, Facebook said the connections it found with previously identified IRA accounts were “on their own insufficient to support a firm determination [that IRA was behind the activity], as we have also seen examples of authentic political groups interacting with IRA content in the past.” 
Facebook also said, “some of the tools, techniques and procedures of this actor are consistent with those we saw from the IRA in 2016 and 2017. But we don’t believe this evidence is strong enough to provide public attribution to the IRA. The [tools, techniques and procedures] of the IRA have been widely discussed and disseminated, including by Facebook, and it’s possible that a separate actor could be copying their techniques.”
Congressional Response to Facebook’s Announcement
The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said, ""Today's announcement from Facebook demonstrates what we've long feared: that malicious foreign actors bearing the hallmarks of previously-identified Russian influence campaigns continue to abuse and weaponize social media platforms to influence the U.S. electorate.""
Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said he is “glad to see that Facebook is taking a much-needed step toward limiting the use of their platform by foreign influence campaigns. The goal of these operations is to sow discord, distrust, and division in an attempt to undermine public faith in our institutions and our political system.”
Facebook did not say what country the accounts and pages may have originated from. It said, “It’s clear that whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their true identities than [the IRA] has in the past.”

40843,2018-08-02,Wells Fargo to pay $2.09B fine for alleged loan practices,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Wells Fargo had agreed to pay a $2.09 billion fine for allegedly issuing mortgage loans to people whom it knew had incorrect income information on their loan applications. The Justice Department said, “Investors, including federally insured financial institutions, suffered billions of dollars in losses from investing in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) containing loans originated by Wells Fargo.” The company did not admit liability as part of the settlement. 
The Justice Department issued the fine under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). 
The government said that in 2005 Wells Fargo “began an initiative to double its production of subprime and Alt-A loans.” Subprime loans are made to borrowers who do not qualify for prime interest rates due to conditions such as low credit scores, bankruptcies and past payment delinquencies, according to the Federal Reserve. Alt-A loans or “near-prime” loans are given to “borrowers with good credit records who do not meet standard guidelines for documentation requirements, debt-to-income ratios, or loan-to-value ratios.” 
The government alleged as part of the initiative to increase such loans, “Wells Fargo loosened its requirements for originating stated income loans – loans where a borrower simply states his or her income without providing any supporting income documentation.” 
The government said Wells Fargo checked some loan recipients’ incomes against Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax transcripts and found that more than 70 percent of the loans it sampled in this way had a greater than 20 percent discrepancy between the borrower’s stated income and the income on the borrower’s most recent tax returns. The average discrepancy was 65 percent. Wells Fargo then attempted to determine if “plausible” explanations existed for the applications with discrepancies of 20 percent or more, and found that nearly half of them did not, according to the government. 
The Justice Department said these results were “widely distributed” among Wells Fargo employees. The government alleged that Wells Fargo did not disclose this information, and reported inaccurate debt-to-income ratios to investors for the loans it had issued.
The Justice Department also alleged that “Wells Fargo took steps to insulate itself from the risks of its stated income loans, by screening out many of these loans from its own loan portfolio held for investment and by limiting its liability to third parties for the accuracy of its stated income loans.” 
“Wells Fargo sold at least 73,539 stated income loans that were included in RMBS between 2005 to 2007,” the government alleged. “And nearly half of those loans have defaulted, resulting in billions of dollars in losses to investors.”
Wells Fargo’s Response
In response to the announcement, Wells Fargo said it “remains focused on [its] important role as one of the nation's leading providers of mortgage financing.” 
“We are pleased to put behind us these legacy issues regarding claims related to residential mortgage-backed securities activities that occurred more than a decade ago,” Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said. The company also said the Justice Department has previously reached settlement agreements with other banks over loan issues. 
The company said Wednesday that it had already set aside the money needed to pay the fine.
Wells Fargo had previously agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine in April 2016 for improper mortgage lending practices. At the time, the Justice Department said, “Wells Fargo Bank admits that it certified that loans were eligible for [Federal Housing Administration] FHA mortgage insurance when they were not, and that it did not disclose thousands of faulty mortgage loans to [Housing and Urban Development] HUD.”

40826,2018-08-02,"US sanctions Turkish ministers of justice, interior over US pastor’s detainment","On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued sanctions against Turkey’s ministers of justice and interior over Turkey’s 2016 arrest of American pastor Andrew Brunson after a failed coup in the country that year. Brunson was “accused of aiding armed terrorist organizations and obtaining confidential government information for political and military espionage,” according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Brunson could be jailed for up to 35 years in Turkey if found guilty after his trial resumes in October. He has denied the espionage charges.
The two sanctioned Turkish officials, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, “played leading roles in the organizations responsible for the arrest and detention” of Brunson, the Treasury Department said. “These officials serve as leaders of Turkish government organizations responsible for implementing Turkey’s serious human rights abuses,” it added.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that as a result of the sanctions, “any property or interest in property of both ministers within U.S. jurisdiction is blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.”
“We've seen no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong,” Sanders also said. “We believe he's a victim of unfair and unjust detention.” 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the detention “unacceptable,” adding that President Donald Trump “has made it abundantly clear that the United States expects Turkey to release him immediately.”
Turkey's foreign ministry said it had shared “necessary information” with the U.S. about Brunson, and said the case should be decided by the Turkish judiciary. The ministry previously said U.S. requests for Turkey to release Brunson were “unacceptable.”
Authorities have arrested more than 50,000 people in Turkey since a failed coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government in July 2016, BBC reported. Twenty Americans are among those charged with crimes in relation to the failed coup, according to The New York Times. 
Erdoğan has said Pennsylvania-based Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen was responsible for the coup, which Gülen denies. Erdoğan has said he would exchange Gülen for Brunson with the U.S., BBC reported. 
Brunson, 50, is originally from North Carolina and has lived in Turkey for 23 years, Fox News reported. He lived there with his wife and three children while he was pastor of the Izmir Resurrection Church, with a congregation of about two dozen. He was arrested in October 2016 and released to home detention for health reasons last week.

40830,2018-08-02,Former President Obama endorses 81 Democratic candidates for November elections,"On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama endorsed 81 Democratic candidates from 14 states in the November U.S. midterm elections. The list includes five candidates for governor, one U.S. Senate candidate and 22 U.S. House candidates. Also on the list are candidates for state positions in the house, senate, lieutenant governor, secretary of agriculture, secretary of state, auditor and attorney general. There are 48 female candidates on the list, and 33 males.
He previously endorsed Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who is running for reelection against another Democrat, Kevin de Leon. She was not specifically mentioned on this list. 
Obama tweeted the list of candidates he was endorsing, and his office said he would endorse more candidates before the November 6 midterm elections. “I am proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates—leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent,” Obama said. 
“I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity that’s broadly shared, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility and the rule of law,” the former president added. “But first, they need our votes.”
A statement from Obama’s office announcing the endorsements said, “In issuing this first round of endorsements, President Obama hopes to help current and aspiring Democratic leaders establish themselves, build their profiles, and lead their communities.”

40794,2018-08-02,US judge temporarily blocks company posting 3D-printed firearm blueprints online,"A federal judge in Seattle temporarily ordered on Tuesday that blueprints for 3D-printed guns from non-profit company Defense Distributed be removed from online availability. On Monday, eight state attorneys general sued to stop the Texas-based company from being allowed to post the designs online. 

In 2013, the government had blocked the company from posting such blueprints. In June of this year, after a multi-year lawsuit, the company came to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State allowing it to post designs online. The eight state attorneys general who sued argued that 3D-printed plastic firearms are dangerous because they are untraceable, can be undetectable and do not require background checks to produce.
Before the Tuesday ruling, Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson said in an interview with CBS News, “I believe that I am championing the Second Amendment in the 21st century.""  He added, “I think access to the firearm is a fundamental human dignity. It's a fundamental human right.”
Wilson made the world’s first working plastic gun in 2013, CBS News reported. 
In addition to the lawsuit from eight states, attorneys general from 21 states called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the government’s agreement with Defense Distributed that allowed the company to post designs online. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) announced Tuesday he was introducing legislation to prohibit the online publication of 3D-printed firearm blueprints.
Defense Distributed blueprints and machines
As of last Friday, Defense Distributed had published 10 blueprints online, including for handguns and AR-15-style rifles. The ones for AR-15-style rifles had been downloaded thousands of times by Tuesday.
“The guns are downloadable,” Wilson said. “The files are in the public domain. You cannot take them back. You can adjust your politics to this reality. You will not ask me to adjust mine.”
“I’m talking about files,” Wilson added. “I'm not talking about the guns. I'm not a licensed gun manufacturer. I don't make guns at this location [where the company is based in Texas]. I have data, I can share the data.” 
Wilson's company also sells milling machines for $2,000 that are pre-loaded with design files. The machines can be used in creating handguns and AR-15-style rifles in about two days. The company has a three-month backlog of orders for the machines, and Wilson says he screens people who want to buy his company’s milling machines. 
A milling machine is different from a 3D-printer in that a milling machine removes material to make a part, such as from a metal or plastic starting piece, while a 3D-printer adds material, such as plastic, to make a part, according to All3DP, a 3D-printing magazine.
Industry experts say 3D-printers can be expensive, and 3D-printed guns may not last as long as normally manufactured guns, The Associated Press reported.
“What I'm doing is legally protected,” Wilson said. “I will go to the appellate level. I will go to the Supreme Court. I will waste all my time.” He agreed to not publish new 3D-printed firearm blueprints online during the temporary court order, which is in effect until a new hearing is held in September.
White House on the issue
Prior to the court order, President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning, “I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to [the National Rifle Association], doesn’t seem to make much sense!”
White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said Tuesday, “The president is committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility. In the United States, it is currently illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind -- including those made on a 3D printer.” Gridley added, “The administration supports this nearly two-decade old law. We will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments.”
Other responses 
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said, “Metal detectors and other security measures will be completely useless against the flood of undetectable and untraceable ‘ghost guns’ that the GOP is inviting into our schools, workplaces, airports and public buildings.”
On Tuesday, NRA Executive Director Chris Cox said, “Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years. Federal law passed in 1988, crafted with the NRA's support, makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive an undetectable firearm.”
“Many anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3-D printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms,” Cox added. 
Po Murray, chairwoman of Newtown Action Alliance, a gun control group created after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2013, said, “there is nothing good that can come with Defense Distributed uploading these files.” She said, “our laws and our policies have to keep up with the changing advancements in technology.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2015 there were 36,252 firearm-related deaths in the U.S., with 12,979 of those homicides.

40791,2018-08-02,At least 3 dead in protests in Zimbabwe’s capital over election results reporting delays,"At least 3 people were killed and multiple others wounded on Wednesday after the Zimbabwe army fired on protesters in the capital city of Harare. Thousands of demonstrators were protesting delays in reporting the official results of Monday’s election. 
Supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party damaged signs, stoplights and benches in the city before police fired warning shots and used water cannons and tear gas on the crowds. Protesters also burned tires, threw rocks and blocked streets, The Washington Post reported. 
On Wednesday morning, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the ruling ZANU-PF party tweeted, “At this crucial time, I call on everyone to desist from provocative declarations and statements. We must all demonstrate patience and maturity, and act in a way that puts our people and their safety first. Now is the time for responsibility and above all, peace.”
MDC’s candidate for president, Nelson Chamisa, had declared victory on Tuesday before any announcement of official results.
Preliminary results
The election commission has announced some parliamentary results, including saying that 122 out of 210 seats in the National Assembly’s lower house would go to the ZANU-PF party, 53 to MDC, 2 to other parties with 33 not yet declared. The election commission has until Saturday to report the full election results. 
An announcement on the results for president was not made on Wednesday due to some of the 23 candidates not being present to verify the results, according to BBC.
Voter turnout on Monday was about 70 percent of the more than five million people registered to vote, BBC reported. If no presidential candidate receives a majority of the votes from Monday’s election, there will be a runoff between the top two finishers on Sept. 8.
Election observers
Elmar Brok, leader of the EU’s election observer mission, was critical of the election commission’s “lack of transparency” and “some problems around polling stations” on voting day. He also said, “In some senses, up to this point, the conduct of the polls has had a number of positive features.” He said delays in the election commission releasing official results could result in it losing credibility. 
The EU mission also said there were issues with the vote, including mistrust of the electoral commission, media bias and voter intimidation. The mission added that there was an ""improved political climate, but un-level playing field and lack of trust.”
The African Union mission said the elections “took place in a very peaceful environment” and “were highly competitive.” It said it could not confirm allegations by opposition parties that there was voter intimidation and vote-buying during the election. 
Violence has occurred after elections in Zimbabwe in the past. In 2008, at which point President Robert Mugabe had been in power as prime minister or president for 28 years, the opposition said it had won the presidency. There was then a runoff election, with some supporters of Mugabe’s government committing violence, and the opposition candidate withdrew.
Monday’s election was the first since Robert Mugabe resigned from office last year after a military coup took over the government.

41269,2018-08-03,Suicide attack kills at least 39 at Shiite mosque in Afghanistan,"Two assailants killed at least 39 people and injured at least 80 others at a Shiite mosque in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, local officials said. Two men armed with guns and explosives entered the mosque in the city of Gardez, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Kabul in Paktia province, during Friday’s afternoon prayers. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and the Taliban denied it was responsible.
The assailants were dressed in burkas with full face veils, according to a spokesman for Paktia province, Sardar Wali Tabasum. “One opened fire on the worshipers before the second one blew up explosives on his body,” Tabasum said. 
Abdullah Hasrat, a spokesman for the provincial governor, confirmed that 39 people had been killed. He said children and several senior Shiite clerics were among the deceased. 
President Ashraf Ghani called the attack “inhumane,” and alleged it was intended to create sectarian division. 
Afghanistan’s population is approximately 99 percent Muslim, with an estimated 80 to 89 percent Sunni Muslims, and estimated 10 to 19 percent Shiite Muslims, according to World Population Review statistics. The Islamic State (IS) militant group has previously attacked Shiite mosques and considers Shiites heretical. IS has not claimed responsibility for this attack. 
Recent Afghanistan attacks
On Tuesday, an attack at a government compound in the eastern Afghanistan city of Jalalabad killed at least 15 people, and injured 15 others. IS claimed responsibility for that attack.
In a separate incident Tuesday, at least 11 people were killed and 37 more wounded when a passenger bus drove over a roadside bomb in the city of Farah, officials said. The government said the Taliban was responsible for the attack, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Charlotte Bellis. The Taliban did not immediately claim responsibility.
Also on Tuesday, unknown assailants abducted 22 people from their vehicles in a highway between Kabul and Gardez, BBC reported. 
On Saturday, attackers entered a training center for midwives in Jalalabad and battled government forces there for nearly six hours. Two people were killed in that attack.

The United Nations reported that 1,692 Afghan civilians were killed in the first half of the year, the most in a six-month period since 2009, when it began keeping records. Al Jazeera reported that 2,427 Afghanis have been killed and 3,929 injured in 151 attacks since January 2016.
U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001, following the 9/11 attacks. In June, the Afghan government declared a temporary ceasefire with the Taliban and the Taliban responded by declaring a ceasefire with the government for three days. IS and other militant groups are also active in Afghanistan. The U.S. has recently conducted airstrikes against IS targets, BBC reported.

41258,2018-08-03,China announces tariffs on $60B of US goods if US implements planned tariffs,"China announced on Friday that it would “instantly” impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. products if the U.S. moves forward with a proposal to implement tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) began reviewing that proposal at the request of President Donald Trump. The plan is currently in a public comment period until Aug. 30. 
The announced Chinese plan would apply tariffs to 5,207 different U.S. products in four rate categories, China’s Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council announced. The rates would be 5, 10, 20 and 25 percent, on products including alcoholic drinks, auto parts, coffee, furniture, liquified natural gas, leather products, machinery, meat, minerals, nuts, and wood products. The commission said “China was forced to take the countermeasures” because of the U.S. tariffs. 
“The United States violated consensuses reached by multiple bilateral negotiations and once again unilaterally escalated trade frictions,” the commission said. “If the United States acts willfully and puts its additional tariff measures into effect, China will instantly implement such tariff measures.” China also alleged that the U.S. violated World Trade Organization rules and damaged free trade and Chinese interests.
Trump has said the tariffs against China are necessary because of the trade deficit the U.S. has with the country. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Friday that “China should address the longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices,” instead of “retaliating.”
Background
In June, Trump directed the USTR to create a list of Chinese products that the U.S. could apply a 10 percent tariff on, in case China retaliated against the U.S. for 25 percent tariffs it implemented on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on July 6. China then did impose retaliatory tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods.
On July 10, the USTR released a list of $200 billion worth of products for a potential 10 percent tariff. Then last week, the White House directed the USTR to plan to increase the proposed tariffs to 25 percent, from 10 percent, for the $200 billion of products. 
U.S. tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against “unfair” or “discriminatory” trade practices, or trade agreement violations. A USTR section 301 investigation concluded that “the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.” 
On July 11, the U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution in a 88 to 11 vote calling on Trump to obtain congressional approval prior to using “national security concerns” as a justification for imposing tariffs on other countries.
US-China trade relations
The U.S. and China have the largest trading relationship of any two countries, annually exchanging about $635 billion worth of goods in 2017, according to U.S. government figures. That year, the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $375 billion with China, meaning that the value of goods the U.S. purchased from China was that much higher than the value of the goods China bought from the U.S. 
Of all the goods the U.S. imports, 18 percent come from China, and of all the goods the U.S. exports, 8 percent are bought by China, according to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2016 statistics.

41212,2018-08-03,Mnangagwa declared winner of Zimbabwe’s presidential election,"Early Friday morning, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) declared incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the Zanu-PF party the winner of Monday’s presidential election with 50.8 percent of the vote. Nelson Chamisa of the MDC party won 44.3 percent of the vote, according to the ZEC. A runoff was avoided since Mnangagwa won more than 50 percent of the vote. Mnangagwa, who is also leader of the Zanu-PF, received 2.46 million votes to Chamisa’s 2.14 million. There were a total of 23 candidates in the election.
At least six people have been killed in the capital city of Harare since protests over the delay in reporting voting results began there Wednesday, with the military shooting at some protesters. Chamisa won 71 percent of the vote in the capital.
MDC Chairman Morgan Komichi said the election was “fraudulent” and that his party would challenge the results in court. Police detained eighteen MDC officials during a raid on the party’s headquarters in Harare on Thursday, according to The Guardian. 
The ZEC said it would make all polling station data available to the media and party officials.
After the ZEC announced the results, Mnangagwa tweeted, “Thank you Zimbabwe! I am humbled to be elected President of the Second Republic of Zimbabwe. Though we may have been divided at the polls, we are united in our dreams. This is a new beginning. Let us join hands, in peace, unity  together build a new Zimbabwe for all!”
Monday’s election was the first since former President Robert Mugabe resigned from office last November after a military coup took over the government. Zanu-PF then appointed Mnangagwa, who had previously been vice president under Mugabe, as its new leader.

41207,2018-08-03,Saudi-led coalition airstrikes kill at least 20 in Yemeni port city of Hodeidah,"Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Hodeidah, Yemen, killed at least 20 people and wounded at least 60 on Thursday, according to a doctor at the city’s al-Thawra hospital. The airstrikes hit the city’s fishing port and fish market close to the hospital, Al Jazeera reported. The coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels in the city since June, in an effort to regain control of Hodeidah’s airport and seaport. 
Coalition sea vessels and ground troops have been involved in the Hodeidah offensive as well, according to Saudi state media. The coalition has taken control of the airport and not the seaport, Al Jazeera reported. The outlet also reported the Houthis have controlled Hodeidah since 2014. Saudi Arabia says the Houthis are using the seaport to bring in weapons from Iran.
Yemen’s civil war began in 2014. The Houthis took control of Sanaa, Yemen’s capital, in September 2014, after which Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi went into exile. Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of Arab countries to fight Houthis in Yemen since March 2015. Iran supplies the Houthis with weapons, according to the United Nations, the U.S. and other nations.
The war has resulted in the deaths of more than 10,000 people, two-thirds of them civilians, BBC reported. The war has also left more than 40,000 people wounded, and displaced about 2 million.

41203,2018-08-03,EPA proposes reducing average fuel economy standard from 47 to 37 mpg in 2025,"On Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposal for new corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards it and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) developed for model year 2021 to 2026 vehicles. A government fact sheet said the CAFE standards required for model year 2025 would be 37.0 miles per gallon (mpg), compared to the 46.7 mpg projected under rules proposed in 2012. The proposal would remove California’s ability to set its own emission standards. The public will have 60 days to comment on the plan.
According to the EPA, fuel economy numbers posted on new vehicle windows are, on average, 20 to 25 percent lower than CAFE fuel economy numbers. For instance, 37 mpg would be higher than the average of about 28 to 30 mpg seen by consumers on new vehicle windows.
Acting EPA head Andrew Wheeler said, “Our proposal aims to strike the right regulatory balance based on the most recent information and create a 50-state solution that will enable more Americans to afford newer, safer vehicles that pollute less. He added that “more realistic standards can save lives while continuing to improve the environment.” 
The EPA’s announcement said the proposal “reflects a balance of safety, economics, technology, fuel conservation, and pollution reduction. It is anticipated to prevent thousands of on-road fatalities and injuries as compared to the standards set forth in the 2012 final rule.”
The EPA said the new standards would lower the costs of new vehicles, which it said are safer, and in turn would result in more people buying new, safer vehicles. In support of its claim on fatalities, the EPA cited a 2018 study by the NHTSA that indicated newer vehicles are safer than older vehicles. The study found this was both due to newer model year vehicles showing lower percentages of accident fatalities than older vehicles, and due to the percentage of fatalities increasing as a vehicle ages for a given model year. The study did not provide reasons for why these trends were observed, and noted the NHTSA had not analyzed the data for factors such as age of drivers and relative rates of seatbelt use. 
The study used, as a measure of safety, the average percentage of occupants killed in accidents that involved at least one fatality for cars, SUVs, pickup trucks and vans. Regarding that measure, the study did not take into account the possible effects of varying average vehicle occupancy rates with vehicle age, for instance. Nor did it take into account changes in percentages of vehicles on the road that were cars versus SUVs. In 2012, cars accounted for about 50 percent of new vehicle sales, and now they account for about one-third, with trucks and SUVs making up some of the rest, according to The Associated Press.
In 2017, there were 37,150 fatalities on U.S. roads, according to the Post.
Nationwide standards
In addition to setting fuel economy standards to remain the same after 2020, the EPA proposal would also make emission requirements equal in all 50 states. As granted by the 1970 Clean Air Act, California has had the ability to set its own emission standards and thus, indirectly, fuel economy, The Washington Post reported. Twelve other states and the District of Columbia have since adopted California’s standards. California would not be able to set its own standards under the new EPA proposal. Passenger vehicle sales in California and areas following its standards account for about a third of total U.S. sales, according to CNN. It adds to manufacturers’ costs to satisfy two sets of emissions standards, state and federal, rather than one.
In May, California and 16 other states sued the EPA over its decision to rescind 2012 emission standards regulations that the EPA implemented in January 2017. On Thursday, 19 state attorneys general joined California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who said his the state would “use every legal tool at its disposal to defend today’s national standards and reaffirm the facts and science behind them.” U.S. officials said they would like to meet with California officials to mutually agree on regulation, according to CNN. Becerra said he was willing to meet with federal officials and that “so far we have not had a receptive audience in the Trump administration.”
Fact sheet on the proposed standards
In a fact sheet, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the EPA said there would be a $2,340 reduction in overall average vehicle ownership costs for new vehicles under the new standards, though it did not specify the model year the change would affect. In 2016, the EPA and NHTSA released estimates of costs ranging from about $900 to $1,200 per vehicle to comply with new standards by model year 2025, according to the Post. The fact sheet does not mention if increased gas costs from decreased fuel economy were included in its $2,340 cost reduction.
The fact sheet said up to 1,000 lives would be saved annually from crash fatalities as consumers buy more new cars that are safer under the proposed standards. It did not say what effect the new standards might have on lives lost due to air pollution. 
The fact sheet also said there would be a more than $500 billion reduction in “societal costs” over 50 years, including “technology costs,” as well as costs from accident casualties and “additional congestion and noise.” 
It also said there would be a $252.6 billion reduction in regulatory costs for manufacturers through model year 2029, and a reduction of hybrid vehicles “needed” to comply with fuel economy standards from 56 percent to 3 percent in model year 2030. The fact sheet said there was a projected increase of 3/1,000th of a degree Celsius in global average temperature by the year 2100 resulting from the new standards. 
Response to the proposal
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the EPA’s proposal was a ""dangerous assault on clean air and public health in California and across the nation."" Pelosi said the “illegal and unjust attack on the vital clean air protections set by California and the 12 states that join it will choke our communities with smog.” Pelosi said California would ""continue to work with automakers to overcome the Trump obstruction to build cleaner, more affordable and safe vehicles for our communities.""
Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said, “With today’s release of the Administration’s proposals, it’s time for substantive negotiations to begin. We urge California and the federal government to find a common sense solution that sets continued increases in vehicle efficiency standards while also meeting the needs of America’s drivers.”
President and Chief Executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers Mitch Bailwol said in April that his organization remains “absolutely convinced that one national program [for setting fuel economy standards] is the preferred policy path.”

41287,2018-08-04,Judge orders Trump administration to restart DACA program,"On Friday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to restart the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which the Trump administration rescinded last year. The DACA program offers certain illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as minors renewable 2-year work permits and protection from deportation. The court’s order to restart DACA is delayed until Aug. 23 to give the administration an opportunity to appeal the decision. 
The DACA program, which was first implemented under the Obama administration, applies to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. before June 15, 2012, and were under the age of 16 when they arrived. 
In September of last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was “being rescinded,” saying that new applications as well as renewals after a certain date would not be accepted. In April of this year, Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia gave the Trump administration 90 days to “better explain” its reason for declaring the DACA program unlawful. 
In his 25-page ruling on Friday, Bates said a June memo from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen failed to “elaborate meaningfully on the agency's primary rationale” for rescinding DACA. 
Nielsen had written that she agreed with the legal argument described in a Sept. 5, 2017 directive from then-acting Secretary Elaine Duke. Nielsen argued that DHS has the power to absolve the program since the department had created it, and that it would likely be found unconstitutional in another lawsuit. Bates said Nielsen did not provide “a considered legal assessment that this court could subject to judicial review.”
Federal district courts in California and New York, in January and February rulings, respectively, ordered the government to accept DACA work permit renewals. Friday’s ruling also applies to accepting new applications. 
In a lawsuit filed in May, Texas and six other states sued the government, arguing the DACA program was “unlawful” and asking for the program to end. Specifically, the suit requested the court prohibit the government “from issuing or renewing DACA permits in the future, effectively phasing out the program within two years.” The judge in that case is expected to rule within the next week, CNN reported. 
More than 700,000 people are currently enrolled in the DACA program.

41518,2018-08-08,US imposes new sanctions on Russia citing nerve agent attack,"On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced new sanctions on the Russian Federation for allegedly using a lethal nerve agent against Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal, in violation of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act. Sergei Skripal was a former Russian spy who worked as a double agent for British Intelligence and became a U.K. citizen. The pair were poisoned in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. Russia has denied involvement. 
The sanctions are scheduled to take effect on Aug. 22, after a 15-day congressional notification period and upon publication in the U.S. Federal Register. A department spokesperson said the sanctions apply to “essentially all” Russian state-owned or state-funded enterprises, and estimated that they could affect 70 percent of the country’s economy and about 40 percent of its workforce.
During a press briefing, a U.S. senior state official said that as part of the sanctions, licenses issued by the Department of Commerce for certain “national security sensitive goods or technologies” would be denied to Russian entities. Such goods may include aero gas turbine engines, integrated circuits, and test and calibration equipment. Russian entities working or contracted with the U.S. government on space flight and commercial passenger aviation may be exempted from the sanctions. Certain unspecified “foreign assistance” to Russian people would also continue.
“Following the use of a ‘Novichok’ nerve agent in an attempt to assassinate UK citizen Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal, the United States, on August 6, 2018, determined under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act) that the Government of the Russian Federation has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals,” according to a statement issued by State Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert.
The State Department said that if Russia does not meet criteria imposed by the sanctions within 90 days of Wednesday’s announcement, additional sanctions may be issued. The criteria include:

	Providing proof that Russia is no longer using chemical or biological weapons “in violation of international law” or “against its own nationals.”
	A request that Russia provide “reliable assurances” that it won’t “engage in such activities” in the future.
	Allowing on-site inspections by United Nations observers or “other internationally recognized impartial observers, or other reliable means” to ensure that Russia is not violating international law with the use of chemical or biological weapons.

Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russian involvement during a press conference Thursday. “We believe linking new [U.S.] restrictive measures, which we continue to consider illegitimate, to the Salisbury case is totally unacceptable,” Russian state media TASS quoted Peskov as saying. “We once again flatly reject any accusations regarding the possible involvement of the Russian state in what happened in Salisbury. That’s out of the question. Moreover, we cannot even say unequivocally what and how was used in Britain, because we have no information and have no response to our proposal to the UK on a joint probe into that incident we are profoundly concerned about.”

The Skripal case
Sergei, 66, and Yulia Skripal, 33, were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury, England, on March 4, 2018. Police on the scene described the Skripals as being in “extremely serious condition,” BBC reported. 
Investigators said it appeared the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at the front door of Sergei Skripal’s home. Det. Sgt. Nick Bailey became ill after working at the scene, was treated and then discharged on March 22. U.K. police suspected Skripal was targeted due to his Russian intelligence connections.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an independent international body that monitors chemical weapons, and the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory helped identify the nerve agent as “Novichok” by analyzing samples taken from the victims, areas around Sergei Skripals’ home and places he and his daughter had visited the day of the poisoning. According to a letter sent from the U.K. national security advisor to the NATO Secretary General, Russia stockpiled and produced small quantities of Novichok within the last decade.
Leaders of France, Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. issued a joint statement on March 15 condemning the attack and attributing it to Russia.
In May, both Skripals recovered from the poisoning and were discharged from the hospital. They are currently in an undisclosed location in England under police protection, The Guardian reported.
After Prime Minister Theresa May declared that Russia was “culpable” for the alleged attack, the U.K. expelled 23 Russian diplomats from its consulate. President Donald Trump also responded by expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S. In return, Russia expelled 23 British diplomats and 60 U.S. diplomats, and closed the St. Petersburg consulates for both countries.

41542,2018-08-09,NYC imposes one-year freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses,"The New York City Council passed a bill on Wednesday requiring a government agency to conduct a one-year study on whether to adopt regulations and standards for the number of for-hire vehicle licenses the city issues, including those for Uber and Lyft drivers. The bill also placed a one-year freeze on any new for-hire vehicle licenses while the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) conducts the study. 
The city council approved the measure in a five to one vote, with one council member abstaining. 
The bill allowed an exception for licenses of wheelchair-accessible vehicles. License renewals for existing for-hire vehicles would also continue.
A city council report supporting the bill noted that “application-based technology,” such as the Uber or Lyft rideshare apps, has allowed people to have greater access to transportation services, but that “the sector’s rapid growth over the past several years has led to economic and environmental concerns that some argue need to be addressed.” The number of for-hire licensed vehicles in New York City has gone from 39,708 in 2011 to 102,536 in 2017, according to TLC.
The city council also agreed to establish minimum fare rates and payments for the drivers. An exact minimum fare was not included in the council’s bill; it proposed a methodology that would take certain metrics into account, such as the duration and distance of the trip as well as the driver’s operation expenses.
Responses to the decision
Mayor Bill de Blasio described the council’s decision as a “victory for working New Yorkers over corporate greed.” 
The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) called the council’s decision a victory. “Today, NYTWA members won a historic victory as New York City Council voted ‘yes’ on the first legislation of its kind to regulate app companies like Uber and Lyft! New York City is the first city in the country to enact drivers' demands into legislation! Months of tireless organizing from members of every sector - yellow, app-based, green, livery, black car - made this victory possible!”
Uber said in a statement prior to the council vote that such a decision might lead to increased prices and wait times for customers in the city, and make getting an Uber trip outside of Manhattan more difficult. Joseph Okpaku, Lyft’s vice president of public policy, also noted the potential for longer wait times and higher fares as a result of the council’s decision. 
Okpaku said companies like Lyft and Uber often work in underserved neighborhoods where traditional taxi cabs don’t operate. The final iteration of the bill allowed for the TLC to issue “any number of new for-hire vehicle licenses upon a determination by the commission that issuing such number of new for-hire vehicle licenses would increase the availability of for-hire services in different geographic areas of the city where such services are needed, and where such licenses would not substantially contribute to traffic congestion.”",The Facts,USA,,Bill de Blasio|Lyft|New York Taxi Workers Alliance|Uber,New York,ridesharing|transportation,world_news,publish
41535,2018-08-09,NY Rep. Chris Collins indicted on insider trading charge,"Federal prosecutors on Wednesday indicted New York Rep. Chris Collins (R) and his son Cameron for allegedly “participating in a scheme to commit insider trading.” The indictment also charged Stephen Zarsky, the father of Cameron Collins’ fiancee. The three men are each charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud, and making false statements to the FBI. Rep. Collins has denied the charges.
The defendants are accused of illegally selling securities of an Australian biotechnology company called Innate Immunotherapeutics. Rep. Collins sits on the company’s board of directors. According to the indictment, after Collins learned that a clinical drug trial for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects the nervous system, was unsuccessful, he contacted his son and revealed the confidential information. 
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, “insider trading” is a crime when someone involved in the company buys or sells stock, or facilitates the buying and selling of company stock, based on nonpublic information. In this case, Rep. Collins is accused of sharing non-public information that influenced his son and other associates to sell stock before market prices could decline. 
The allegations
The indictment said Collins attempted to contact his son 15 seconds after learning about the trial results on June 22. After several missed calls, Collins had a six minute conversation with his son. The next day, his son began selling company shares. Between the opening of the market on Friday, June 23 and the close of the market on Monday, June 26, Cameron Collins sold about 1.4 million Innate shares before the trial failure became public. 
Cameron Collins allegedly drove to his fiancee’s parents’ house on June 22, and, “within minutes of their arrival,” his fiancee’s mother “took steps to sell her Innate [Immunotherapeutics] shares,” the indictment said. The next day, Collins’ fiancee spoke with her father. The indictment claimed Zarsky placed an order to sell all of his shares in the company about five minutes after speaking with his daughter.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged that Rep. Collins “betrayed his duties of trust and confidence” to Innate Immunotherapeutics by providing “inside information” to his son about the trial results so that his son and Zarsky could trade their shares before the results were made public.
The DOJ said Collins’ actions prevented him and his associates from losing about $768,000. (The DOJ’s estimate was based on the company stock shares after it publicly announced the trial results. Innate Immunotherapeutics announced the trial results the evening of June 26. The next trading day, the company’s shares dropped to $0.0351 from the previous day’s close of $0.45, according to the indictment.)
The DOJ also alleged that Rep. Collins, Cameron Collins and Zarsky made false statements to the FBI “to cover up their participation in the insider trading scheme.”
Collins’ response
Rep. Collins called the charges against him “false” and “meritless” during a press conference on Wednesday, adding that he would “mount a vigorous defense in court” to clear his name. “I believe that I acted properly and within the law at all times with regard to my affiliation with Innate,” Collins said. “Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have followed all rules and all ethical guidelines when it comes to my personal investments, including those with Innate.” 
“When it became clear that the drug I and others believed in fell short of our hopes and expectations, I held on to my shares rather than sell them,” Collins added. “As a result, the significant investment I made in the company worth millions of dollars were wiped out. That’s ok. That’s the risk I took.”
Rep. Collins is up for reelection in November for New York’s 27th Congressional District. He was first elected to represent the district in 2013. Collins said he plans to remain on the ballot for the 2018 election.",Law &amp; Justice|Politics|The Facts,USA,indictment|insider trading,Cameron Collins|Chris Collins|Stephen Zarsky,New York,crime,world_news,publish
41538,2018-08-10,California governor signs executive orders to address wildfires,"California’s governor issued two executive orders on Thursday allowing state officials to direct more resources toward fighting the state’s wildfires. Gov. Jerry Brown ordered a State of Emergency for Orange and Riverside counties to address the “Holy Fire,” which began around the Holy Jim Canyon area of Orange County on Aug. 6. Brown also signed an executive order to “streamline” cleanup and recovery efforts in communities affected by other fires in the state. 
There are about 15 major fires currently burning in California, according to the governor’s office. More than 13,000 firefighters from California, 17 other U.S. states, Australia and New Zealand are working to put out the fires.
Orange and Riverside
The Holy Fire has destroyed an estimated 9,614 acres in Orange County, according to the county’s fire department. 
Brown directed the Office of Emergency Services to assist the local governments of Orange and Riverside counties in controlling the fire and protecting residents. The governor’s order suspended the mandatory one-week waiting period on unemployment insurance applications for anyone who became unemployed as a result of the fire. Fees for replacement drivers’ licenses, insurance cards, vehicle registrations and other official records held by the state have also been suspended for any resident who lost those documents in the fire. 
State officials issued mandatory evacuations orders for nine areas impacted by the fire: Holy Jim Canyon, Trabuco Canyon Recreation Residence Tracts, Blue Jay and Falcon Campground, McVicker and Rice Canyon, El Cariso Village, Rancho Capistrano, Horsethief Canyon, Glen Eden, and Sycamore Creek.
On Thursday, police arrested Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, for allegedly starting the Holy Fire. Clark was charged with one felony count for “aggravated arson” for each of at least five “inhabited structures” that burned, as well as “arson of inhabited property, arson of forest, criminal threats, two felony counts of resisting and deterring an executive officer, and a sentencing enhancement for arson burning multiple structures,” according to the California district attorney’s office. If convicted, he may face a life sentence. 
While the district attorney’s statement did not cite evidence against Clark, Holy Jim Volunteer Fire Department Chief Mike Milligan said Clark had gone to Milligan’s home to allegedly return “borrowed” fire station equipment. Two weeks prior to the fire, Clark reportedly texted Milligan saying, “The place is going to burn just like you planned.” Clark is being held at the Orange County jail on $1 million bail, CNN reported.
Lake, Siskiyou, Shasta, Mendocino and Napa counties
Brown’s other executive order on Thursday called for:

	Expediting cleanup of debris removal from homes and businesses that were damaged or destroyed by the fires. (It did not provide details on the cleanup.)
	Prohibiting “price gouging.” 
	Suspending planning and zoning requirements, and state fees for manufactured homes and mobile home parks.
	Increasing the hiring of additional emergency personnel.
	Providing waivers for temporary school facilities and outdoor physical education requirements to prevent school opening delays in the fall.
	Extending the filing deadline for certain taxes for businesses affected by the fire.
	“Streamlin[ing]” contracting and purchasing rules. (It did not elaborate on how state purchasing would be streamlined.)
	Improving the coordination between state agencies handling environmental restoration in affected areas.

Brown had previously announced that the White House had approved the state’s request for a “Presidential Major Disaster Declaration” for Shasta County. According to the announcement, the declaration makes residents eligible for programs such as housing assistance, food aid, unemployment assistance, counseling, medical services and legal services. It also provides state, tribal and local governments with ongoing emergency response and recovery costs, including mitigation help to reduce the potential for future wildfires.
Brown has also requested presidential major disaster declarations for Lake, Mendocino and Napa counties; the White House is still reviewing those requests.

41545,2018-08-11,Turkey announces retaliatory measures against US after Trump doubles metal tariffs,"Turkey said on Friday that it would take retaliatory trade measures against the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he was doubling tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel to 20 and 50 percent, respectively. The Turkish Foreign Ministry alleged that the U.S. measures were against World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, and that it would determine a WTO-compliant response. 
“Turkey, as it determines and implements its own trade policy in compliance with the World Trade Organization, expects other member countries to comply with international rules,” Turkey’s Foreign Ministry announced on Friday, state-run news outlet Anadolu Agency reported. The ministry specified that it would continue to trade with the U.S.
Earlier on Friday morning, Trump tweeted: “I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!” The president did not specify a reason for the increase. 
As of Friday, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) had not publicly released information about the tariff increase. 
The lira, Turkey’s currency, declined as much as 18 percent after Trump’s announcement on Friday, Reuters reported, in the largest single day decline since 2001. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told supporters at a rally on Friday to exchange any foreign currencies or gold that they had into lira to support the local currency. 
“This will be my people's answer to those who declare economic war against us,” Anadolu Agency quoted Erdoğan saying.
Erdoğan also claimed that the economy would continue to experience growth throughout 2018 regardless of the tariffs applied to Turkish goods. “We won't let anybody deter us from our targets,” he said.
Recent US-Turkish relations

The USTR reported that goods and services trade between the U.S. and Turkey totaled $22.4 billion in 2016, with $17.4 billion of that representing trade in goods. The U.S. had a goods and services trade surplus of $2.5 billion with Turkey that year, according to the USTR’s latest figures. 
In March of this year, Trump announced the U.S. would impose a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imported into the U.S. from most countries, including Turkey.  
Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Turkey’s ministers of justice and interior over Turkey’s 2016 arrest of American pastor Andrew Brunson after a failed coup in the country that year. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that due to the sanctions, “any property or interest in property of both ministers within U.S. jurisdiction is blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.”
Brunson was “accused of aiding armed terrorist organizations and obtaining confidential government information for political and military espionage,” according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Sanders said Brunson, who denies the charges, was “victim of unfair and unjust detention.” 
Authorities have arrested more than 50,000 people in Turkey since a failed coup attempt against Erdoğan’s government in July 2016. Twenty Americans are among those charged with crimes in relation to the failed coup. 
Erdoğan has said Pennsylvania-based Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen was responsible for the coup, which Gülen denies. Erdoğan said he would exchange Gülen for Brunson. Negotiations held in between the two countries over Brunson’s release did not result in a deal, Reuters reported.

41531,2018-08-11,Ohio Special Election too close to call,"Ohio’s Tuesday special election for 12th Congressional district between Troy Balderson (R) and Danny O'Connor (D) was too close to call as of Friday evening, with 100 percent of precincts reporting. 
Unofficial results published by the state’s elections commission showed that Balderson won 101,574 votes, O’Conner won 99,820 votes, and Green Party candidate Joe Manchik won 1,127 votes. The state has not yet counted its estimated 5,048 absentee ballots and 3,435 provisional ballots. Outstanding provisional and absentee ballots are not tabulated before the 10th day following an election, according to the state’s elections commission.
On Wednesday, Franklin County, which is part of Ohio’s 12 Congressional District, announced that its Board of Elections found 588 uncounted votes during a preliminary audit. Of the uncounted votes, 198 went to Troy Balderson, 388 went to Danny O’Connor, and two went to Joe Manchik.
If the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent of all votes cast and counted, Ohio state law requires the secretary of state to order a recount.
“The bipartisan teams of officials who administered today’s special election did so with the professionalism that has become the standard in Ohio,” Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said in a statement issued Tuesday. “This standard of professionalism will be upheld in the coming weeks as election officials begin the process of tabulating provisional and absentee ballots in order to certify the official election results.” On Thursday, Husted said the state would continue to receive and count absentee ballots postmarked for Aug. 6 and received by Aug. 17.
Balderson declared victory through a Facebook announcement the night of the election, without mentioning the potential for a recount. “I am honored for the opportunity to represent Ohio’s 12th Congressional District,” the statement said. “I will work relentlessly for everyone in this district. Congratulations to Danny O’Connor on running a hard fought race.”
O’Connor has not conceded and continues to fundraise, asking voters to donate and make sure that “every last vote is counted fairly.”

41548,2018-08-13,Unite the Right holds Washington rally as counter-protesters demonstrate,"“Unite the Right,” a self-described free-speech group that critics have called “white nationalist,” held a rally in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, to mark the one-year anniversary of the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. About 40 protesters participated. Multiple groups of counter-protesters held their own rallies on Sunday, including an estimated 150 to 200 who identify as “Antifa,” or anti-fascists, and a couple hundred unrelated groups protesting “white nationalism.” No reports of deaths or major injuries have been filed. 
Last year’s Charlottesville rallies included violent confrontations between protesters and counter-protesters, including the death of Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old woman who was struck by a vehicle that drove into a crowd. Thirty-five others were injured in the violence, and two state troopers also died when their helicopter crashed as they were monitoring the protests. Ohio resident James Alex Fields Jr. was charged with Heyer’s death and a separate hate crime, and has pleaded not guilty. 
Unite the Right’s organizer, Jason Kessler, had originally planned to hold an anniversary rally in Charlottesville, and was denied permission from the city. Kessler previously said he anticipated 400 participants for the Washington rally. Unite the Right protesters in Charlottesville held Confederate battle flags, swastikas and other Nazi symbols, and in one rally chanted the slogan, “Jews will not replace us.”
On Sunday, one man was arrested after assaulting another man who was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat, police said. No other violent incidents between protesters and counter-protesters in Washington were reported.
A select group of “Antifa” counter-protesters were involved in a brief confrontation with police and members of the press in the afternoon, near 13th and G streets NW. Some of the “Antifa” protesters, dressed in black, threw eggs and water bottles towards police or set off firecrackers and smoke bombs. Others reportedly knocked over trash cans. 
Law enforcement measures
D.C. police separated members of the rally and counter-rally from each other using barricades, motorcycles and their own bodies. The Unite the Right protesters were in a cordoned off area in Lafayette Square, across from the White House. 
Police had posted placards in areas around the White House reading, “All Firearms Prohibited Within 1,000 Feet of This Sign,” from 6 a.m. to midnight. The rule was in accordance with a District of Columbia code, The New York Times reported, and mentioned Police Chief Peter Newsham by name. 
Unite the Right protesters were also escorted by police in a specially designated car from the Vienna Metro station in Virginia to a the Foggy Bottom Metro station in Washington. Kessler later tweeted that he apologized to “people who missed taking part” in the rally thinking that the train left at 3 p.m., and said he was given an “ultimatum” by U.S. Marshals to depart early or not at all. 
The union representing Metro employees, two D.C. Council members and others criticized the transit authority for providing the additional protections for the group, with Council member Charles Allen saying it set a “horrible precedent.”
Last week, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) spoke about the planned protest. “While we are opposed adamantly to what we are going to hear, we know what our responsibility is — to protect First Amendment events, to protect Washingtonians and to protect our city,” she said. Bowser returned to the district from an official trip abroad to supervise the city’s response. 
D.C. officials were calculating the total costs of additional police presence and other security measures as of Sunday night. Officials told The Washington Post that a portion of the expenses would be reimbursed by the federal government since the rally occurred on National Park Service land.
Kessler’s comments
Kessler said at the second Unite the Right rally that he wanted to hold it because he wanted to “stand up for free speech and public safety on the one year anniversary of Charlottesville.” He said he was not there to “celebrate the tragedies that happened last year,” and instead wanted to “tell the truth” about what happened. He alleged the Charlottesville police violated the civil rights of rally-goers on both sides, and had allowed the violence to occur. 
Kessler said he has “never claimed to be a white nationalist” and he’s “okay with sharing this country with people from around the world.” He then went on to say “but if you bring in too many people at once, it’s not the same country anymore” and that’s why “a lot of white people feel aggrieved.” 
Kessler has been called a “white nationalist,” and a “white supremacist” by critics.

41559,2018-08-14,Turnover in the Trump administration,"President Donald Trump is often criticized in the media for the amount of turnover in his administration. Has there been more turnover in his administration than previous ones? The short answer is yes. 
How much turnover has there been?
Since the Trump administration began in January 2017, at least 65 people in the executive office of the president or the White House have left their positions, according to figures compiled by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based nonprofit public policy organization. The number is limited to “A team” officials, a designation made by National Journal in its “Decision Makers” editions, and does not include Cabinet secretaries or multiple people who held the same role and both left the position. The figure includes people who were fired, asked to leave, resigned or promoted. 
Seven Cabinet officials have also left office since the beginning of Trump’s term, either “resigning under pressure” or being promoted, according to Brookings. This list includes former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and, most recently, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. 
In addition to the numbers above, six administration officials outside of the executive office and the Cabinet were appointed under Obama and then let go under Trump, including FBI Director James Comey, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Attorney General Sally Yates, and others. 
Other Trump-appointed administration officials have left as well, ranging from personal aides to the president to administration lawyers. 
How does this compare to past administrations?
During Barack Obama’s first term in office, 53 people in “A team” positions left their positions, according to Brookings figures. George W. Bush’s first term saw 63 “A team” positions changing hands. As with the Trump figures, these “A team” numbers include only positions in the executive office of the president, and are based on the National Journal’s “Decision Makers” editions. 
By this metric, Trump’s turnover rate in his first 19 months in office has already surpassed Bush’s and Obama’s rates during their entire four year terms. Bill Clinton’s “A team” first-term turnover was 70.  
Notable departures
Here are some of the notable people who have left the Trump administration: 
Michael Flynn: Retired Lt. Gen. Flynn resigned as Trump’s national security adviser in February 2017, saying in his public resignation letter he had “inadvertently” briefed Vice President Mike Pence and others with “incomplete information” regarding his “phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.” He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador in Washington at the time.
James Comey: Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, saying he “concur[red] with the judgement of the Department of Justice” that Comey was “not able to effectively lead the bureau.” Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein had written in a memo, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails.” 
Comey had previously written memos about his interactions with the president. The New York Times first reported on the memos and they were later publicly released in partially redacted form. According to the memos, Trump reportedly told Comey that Flynn was a “good guy” who had “been through a lot,” adding that the president fired him because he misled Vice President Mike Pence. “I replied by saying, ‘I agree he is a good guy,’ but said no more,” Comey wrote in the memo. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that it was not up to him to say whether Trump’s actions classified as “obstruction of justice.”
Sean Spicer: Spicer resigned as the White House Press Secretary on July 21, 2017, and was replaced by Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. Spicer’s resignation was announced at the same time it was announced that Anthony Scaramucci would be the new White House Communications Director, a position Spicer had been temporarily filling. 
Reince Priebus: Priebus, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, served as Trump’s Chief of Staff for about six months, until July 2017. “The President wanted to go a different direction,” Priebus said on CNN’s “The Situation Room.” The media had reported in previous months that he might be fired.  
Anthony Scaramucci: In one of the shortest tenures of the Trump administration, investment banker Scaramucci was White House Communications Director for 11 days, after taking over from Michael Dubke. He was the third person to leave that position in the Trump administration. 
Steve Bannon: Before coming to the White House as Trump’s chief strategist and “senior counselor,” the Breitbart News Network executive worked as Trump’s campaign chief executive starting in August 2016. Bannon left the Trump administration in August 2017, after magazine The American Prospect quoted Bannon disagreeing with Trump. 
Bannon returned to Breitbart and remained there until January of this year. He left then after Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury” cited Bannon making disparaging remarks about members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s family. Trump then said in a statement that Bannon “has nothing to do with me or my presidency.”
Omarosa Manigault Newman: Manigault Newman, who first met Trump as a contestant on his television show “The Apprentice,” worked as an Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison. She was asked to leave the White House in December 2017 by Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly. 
In August 2018, Manigault Newman released a recording on NBC’s Meet the Press of Kelly asking her to resign in the Situation Room. She then released a tape of Trump phoning her after she was fired, saying he hadn’t previously known about it. 
Andrew McCabe: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe two days before he was planning to retire. Sessions said he fired McCabe based on a Justice Department (DOJ) report alleging he made an “unauthorized disclosure” to the media and “lacked candor” with investigators about an FBI case involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. McCabe denied the allegations.
McCabe said in a statement published by CNN that he was fired because of events he witnessed after Trump fired Comey, and because he said he would corroborate Comey’s “accounts of his discussions with the president.”
Rex Tillerson: Tillerson, a former CEO of ExxonMobil, served as U.S. Secretary of State for from February 2017 to March 2018, when Trump announced Tillerson would be replaced by then-CIA director Mike Pompeo. Trump had denied media rumors that Tillerson was going to be fired. 
Scott Pruitt: In July 2018, Trump announced he had accepted Pruitt’s resignation from his position as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator. Pruitt’s resignation followed a letter from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) that said the EPA needed to “take action” on alleged ethics violations by Pruitt, including his potentially receiving a discounted rental rate from a lobbyist’s spouse, inappropriate travel expenses and potentially “misusing” subordinates’ time, among other issues.

41552,2018-08-14,"FBI fires Peter Strzok, agent who sent text messages critical of Trump","The Federal Bureau of Investigation fired Peter Strzok over text messages that allegedly showed bias against President Donald Trump, Strzok’s lawyer Aitan Goelman confirmed on Monday. Strzok was at the bureau for 21 years, including working on investigations into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, donations to the Clinton Foundation, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference and whether any members of Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia. Strzok was removed from the Russia investigation last year when Mueller was informed of the text messages.
Strzok had sent a series of text messages in 2016 that were critical of Trump to then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he had a relationship at the time and who has since left the FBI. One message from Page to Strzok in August 2016 said then-candidate Trump was “not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” Strzok said his message “was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected, not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation,” according to a report the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released in June of this year.
Strzok, who was a deputy assistant director for counterintelligence, addressed the issue at a public joint hearing of two House committees last month. “Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: Not once in my 26 years of defending our nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took,” Strzok said. “This is true for the Clinton email investigation, for the investigation into Russian interference and for every other investigation I’ve worked on.” He has apologized for sending the messages. 
“A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok’s personal views ever affected his work,” said Goelman, Strzok’s lawyer.
Goelman said in a statement that the firing “departed from established precedent,” alleging it was politically motivated and adding that the “decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans.” He said Deputy Director David Bowdich “overruled” the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, which, after investigation, had advised Strzok should be demoted and suspended for 60 days. 
The FBI has not publicly commented on the dismissal. 
Trump’s response
Trump said in a tweet that Strzok was “finally” fired, and questioned whether the Mueller investigation would be dismissed. “Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI  longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!” Trump’s full tweet said.

42019,2018-08-21,Microsoft announces actions aimed at preventing cyber attacks,"Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined actions in a Monday blog post that the company plans to take to prevent “foreign entities” from launching cyber attacks. The company launched a new Office 365 service called Microsoft AccountGuard, which Smith said provides free cybersecurity protection to all political candidates and campaign offices at the federal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations that the company claims to be “under attack.”
“The internet has become an avenue for some governments to steal and leak information, spread disinformation, and probe and potentially attempt to tamper with voting systems,” Smith said. Previously, U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusions with “high confidence” that the Russian government ordered an influence campaign into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. agencies also alleged that Russian companies stole and leaked information from U.S. political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, prior to the election.  
Smith noted Microsoft’s work to disrupt potentially illegal cyber activities by alleged “foreign entities.” Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) last week “successfully executed a court order to disrupt and transfer control of six internet domains” allegedly created by a group associated with the Russian government, Smith said. The group is known as Strontium, or also by the names Fancy Bear and APT28. 
By gaining control of Fancy Bear’s domains, Microsoft can prevent the alleged hacker group from using those domains and to review whatever content the group intended to display. Microsoft said two of the six domains had names similar to those of U.S. Republican organizations. 
“Attackers want their attacks to look as realistic as possible and they therefore create websites and URLs that look like sites their targeted victims would expect to receive email from or visit,” Smith said. 
“The sites involved in last week’s order fit this description,” Smith explained, noting that some of the domains appeared to “mimic” those of political think tanks and the U.S. Senate, such as one similar to the International Republican Institute’s domain. Smith added that Microsoft has no evidence that the domains were used in attacks or how the hacker group planned to use them.
Smith said the company used its “disrupt and transfer control” technique 12 times in two years to shut down 84 “fake websites” associated with Fancy Bear.
What AccountGuard provides
According to Microsoft, the AccountGuard program is accessible with an Office 365 account, Microsoft’s line of subscription-based office products such as Word and Excel. AccountGuard would provide:

	“Threat” notification through The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.
	Security education services for campaign officials and other political organizations to help them activate features such as multi-factor authentication.
	Previews of new security feature releases.

Fancy Bear’s 2016 election connection
In July 2015, Russian-based entities allegedly hacked the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) networks, according to U.S. intelligence agencies. The hackers reportedly maintained access to the DNC’s network until May 2016, when the DNC hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to help the FBI find the hackers. 
CrowdStrike identified two hacker groups dubbed Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear that it said infiltrated the DNC network. Crowdstrike alleged that both groups worked for the Russian government.
In December 2016, Fancy Bear and APT28 were included in a list issued by the FBI detailing groups working with the “Russian civilian and military Intelligence Services (RIS).” The FBI said RIS activity was part of an “ongoing campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. government and its citizens.” 
RIS activities included “spear phishing” campaigns in which a person or group receives an email or notification that appears to be from a trusted source, but is really intended to steal confidential information such as passwords or social security numbers. The FBI report said APT28 was able to “exfiltrate” data from a “U.S. political party” in the spring of 2016, which was later given to the press and the general public. 
The hacking activities are part of Special Counsel Robert Muller’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election.

41592,2018-08-22,Trump directs Pompeo to ‘study’ South Africa’s land transfers,"U.S. President Donald Trump directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to “closely study” the “land and farm seizures” and “large scale killing of farmers” in South Africa, the president announced on Twitter on Wednesday night. He did not cite evidence of “large scale” killings. South Africa, which is in the process of amending its constitution to allow redistribution of land from the white minority, responded that Trump was “misinformed,” and said on Twitter the viewpoint “only seeks to divide our nation.” 
The ruling party in South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), is currently going through a process to amend the constitution to allow the government to reallocate land from some white people without compensation. Currently, about 9 percent of the population of South Africa is white, while about 72 percent of the farmland is owned by whites, according to government totals. A law from 1913 had granted the majority of fertile farming land to whites, and land reform has been discussed since the end of Apartheid in 1994. 
In February of this year, the South African parliament voted 241 to 83 to pursue amending the constitution for the proposed land reform. The bill had the ANC’s support, though was introduced by another party. The vote directed a governmental committee to review the constitution and report back to the government by Aug. 30. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the matter would be handled with “care and responsibility” and wouldn’t be a “smash and grab.”
Prior to the plans to change the constitution, starting in 1994, land has been redistributed through a system of volunteer white owners selling to volunteer black buyers. That system has resulted in about 10 percent of white owned land changing to black owners, BBC reported. No land has been transferred from whites to blacks through force, according to the South African government. 
Trump’s tweet
Trump tweeted Wednesday night, “I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. ‘South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.’” The president tagged Fox News and its commentator Tucker Carlson in the tweet. 
Trump’s tweet followed a Carlson segment on Fox News about the land seizures, calling them “racist” and saying they were “stealing” land from whites based on their skin color. The segment also discussed what happened in Zimbabwe when it went through land reform, including violence against white farmers and economic downturn. 
Advocates against land appropriation
The South African non-profit group AfriForum, which advocates for “minority rights,” especially the rights of Afrikaners (Dutch-descended South Africans), said in a statement that it “welcomes” Trump’s statement. Representatives of the group had previously visited the U.S. and met with Carlson and U.S.-based think tank the Cato Institute about the issue, AfriForum said, as well as engaged in other international advocacy.
AfriForum also alleged that the ANC continues to “den[y] the fact that farm murders, which are proportionally significantly higher than SA’s average murder rate, is a unique crisis that requires specific attention.”
Murder rates on farms are the highest they have been since 2011, according to the best available data cited by BBC. Between April 2016 and March 2017, 74 people were murdered on farms (counting all races, and including farm employees and owners), South Africa's Police Service said, up from 58 the prior year. 
The exact number of farmers and farm workers is not known, but based on estimates of the total people employed in agriculture, this would be the equivalent of 9.1 out of every 100,000 people. If it counts only commercial farmers, it would be the equivalent of 156 per 100,000, according to AfriForum. 
In the overall population, in the 2016 to 2017 period more than 19,000 people were murdered, equivalent to about 34 of every 100,000 people. 
Government response
A couple hours after Trump’s comments, the South African government tweeted, “South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past. #landexpropriation,” tagging Trump. The government would “take up the matter through diplomatic channels,” said a spokesperson for President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Earlier this week, Ramaphosa called on parliament to quicken the process of amending the constitution, noting again the land reform would be handled with “care.”
“As South Africans we must move away from this fear psychosis that has been going around, particularly those that have been spreading lies and rumours,” Ramaphosa said. “Organizations like AfriForum going overseas and saying that the ANC is out for a land grab.”

42032,2018-08-22,Michael Cohen pleads guilty to 8 criminal counts,"Michael Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight criminal counts related to tax evasion and violation of campaign finance laws. Cohen, a 51-year-old former personal attorney for President Donald Trump, was released on a $500,000 bail to await sentencing.  
The plea agreement, approved by the Justice Department's Tax Division and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), called for a Cohen to receive a prison sentence of between roughly three and a half and five years in prison. Without the plea agreement, the maximum sentence for the eight counts would have been 65 years in prison, according to court documents. 
The eight counts Cohen pleaded guilty to are: 

	Five counts of tax evasion for the years 2012 through 2016;
	One count of making false statements to a financial institution “in connection with a credit decision” (to receive a $500,000 loan, according to prosecutors);
	One count of “willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution” (in reference to a campaign contribution), and;
	One count of making an “excessive campaign contribution.”

In court on Tuesday, without mentioning Trump or others by name, Cohen told the judge about two 2016 payments made while working for an “unnamed candidate,” in reference to the illegal campaign contribution charges in the guilty plea. In response to a question from the judge, he said one payment was made “in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,” and the other was made “under direction of the same candidate.” 
“I participated in this conduct, which on my part took place in Manhattan, for the principal purpose of influencing the election,” Cohen told the judge. 
Cohen reportedly made a $130,000 payment to former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, stage name Stormy Daniels, and a $150,000 payment to American Media Inc. (AMI), the National Enquirer’s parent company, which bought the rights to a story from former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and then never ran it. Both women claim to have had sexual affairs with Trump in 2006, and Trump denies both claims. (Read more about that here.) 
Trump had previously denied knowledge of Cohen’s payments to Clifford and indirectly to McDougal. Legal opinions differ on whether Trump could be charged for campaign finance-related crimes while in office. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel holds that a president cannot be indicted while in office.
The case against Cohen developed from evidence referred to federal prosecutors in New York by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, which is investigating alleged Russian election interference and possible coordination between Russia and members of Trump’s campaign. In April, the FBI raided Cohen’s home, hotel room and office and seized more than four million documents, including information related to the payments to Clifford and McDougal.
As part of Cohen’s plea agreement, he agreed to: pay back taxes as determined by the IRS, currently estimated to be almost $1.5 million; forfeit any property received as a result of making false statements to the financial institution; potentially pay a fine between $20,000 and $1 million; and like serve between 43 and 63 months in prison, in accordance with a “Stipulated Guideline Range.” 
Cohen is scheduled to be sentenced by the court on Dec. 12. Although the court will not be legally bound by the Stipulated Guideline Range, both the defense and the prosecution agreed to that range and both parties agreed not to appeal if a sentence falls within those guidelines.

42029,2018-08-22,EPA proposes changes to coal plant emissions rules,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a new proposal to amend greenhouse gas emissions guidelines for states to regulate existing coal plants. The plan, called the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, would replace the existing Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was introduced in 2015 under the Obama administration. The EPA under the Trump administration concluded, in accordance with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, that the CPP had exceeded the agency’s statutory authority. 
The ACE rule, which addresses coal plants specifically rather than the energy sector more broadly, was written as part of a review that President Donald Trump called for in a March 2017 executive order. In contrast to the CPP, which called for the eventual replacement or termination of coal energy production, the ACE permits existing coal plants to remain open if they become “more efficient,” according to the EPA.
The new proposal plans to address the reduction of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in four main ways. The ACE rule:

	defines a “best system of emission reduction” (BSER) for existing coal-fired power plants, such as heat-rate efficiency improvements. 
	lists “candidate technologies” that individual states can use to establish their standards of performance.
	establishes a new preliminary test to determine whether changes made to power plants (either physical or operational) are considered a “major modification” requiring a New Source Review (NSR). The EPA says this is designed to  “encourage efficiency improvements” at existing power plants. 
	establishes new regulations to implement emissions guidelines under the Clean Air Act section 111(d). The EPA says this would “give states adequate time and flexibility to develop their state plans.”

“The ACE Rule would restore the rule of law and empower states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide modern, reliable, and affordable energy for all Americans,” EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said. “Today’s proposal provides the states and regulated community the certainty they need to continue environmental progress while fulfilling President Trump’s goal of energy dominance.”
According to the EPA’s estimates, the ACE rule could reduce costs associated with compliance by as much as an estimated $400 million annually compared to the CPP. The EPA also estimates it would lead to a 0.2 to 0.5 percent reduction in U.S. retail electricity prices.
The ACE rule also would allow for increased pollutants in the air, due to continued coal energy production. This could lead to an estimated 470 to 1,400 premature deaths each year compared regulations under the CPP, according to the EPA analysis. 
“Coal plants emit more carbon pollution than all other sources,” Carter Roberts, the CEO for environmental advocacy group World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement about the rule. “They’re often more expensive than natural gas, solar, or wind energy. And worst of all, they impose severe public health costs on us all.”
The EPA received more than 270,000 comments since it’s advanced proposal about a replacement regulation from December 2017 until the end of the comment period on April 26 of this year. The EPA will now take public comment on the ACE rule for 60 days.
Background
The 2015 CPP had provided incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well asset carbon emissions regulations for each state based on energy consumption. The plan was intended to lower carbon emissions in compliance with the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, signed by 175 of the world’s 196 countries, committed signatories to reduce the use of fossil fuels and pollution under the premise that it could lower global temperatures by 3.6 ºF by 2025. 
In 2016, 28 states and other plaintiffs challenged the CPP’s legality, and the Supreme Court blocked its implementation in a 5 to 4 decision. Neither the Supreme Court nor the the lower court that heard oral arguments addressed the merits of the lawsuit at the time. The CPP was stayed by the Supreme Court and never went into effect. 
In March of last year, Trump signed the “Presidential Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth.” The order rescinded six presidential actions by Barack Obama that had aimed at reducing carbon emissions or that related to the “impacts of climate change.” Trump’s order also instructed the EPA and other government agencies to conduct a review of government actions related to domestic energy development including fossil fuels, and then rescind or suspend those that “unduly burden the development of domestic energy resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law.” 
In October 2017, then-EPA head Scott Pruitt announced the agency’s plan to officially withdraw from the CPP. In December, the agency released its advance notice of
proposed rulemaking, inviting public comment on specific topics for EPA consideration in drafting a future rule. 
The new ACE rule proposal, released Tuesday, may fulfill a legal burden of the EPA’s to set regulations related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A 2007 Supreme Court 5 to 4 ruling essentially concluded the EPA needed create regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, saying it could not “avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change.”

42026,2018-08-22,US deports Nazi war crime suspect to Germany,"The U.S. deported Jakiw Palij, an alleged former Nazi labor camp guard in German-occupied Poland, to Germany on Tuesday, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Palij, 95, lied about his past work with the Nazis and “fraudulently” became a U.S. citizen. “The United States will never be a safe haven for those who have participated in atrocities, war crimes, and human rights abuses,” said Sessions.
According to ICE, Palij was born in a part of Poland that is now Ukraine, immigrated to the U.S. in 1949 and became a U.S. citizen in 1957. He initially lied to immigration officials by withholding information about his past involvement with the Nazis. Palij instead told immigration officials that during World War II he first worked on his father’s farm and later at a factory in Germany. 
In 2001, Palij told Justice Department officials that he was trained at a Nazi training camp in Trawniki, Poland, in the spring of 1943. On Nov. 3, 1943, Nazis shot and killed about 6,000 Jewish men, women and children being held at Trawniki. “By helping to prevent the escape of these prisoners during his service at Trawniki, Palij played an indispensable role in ensuring that they later met their tragic fate at the hands of the Nazis,” ICE said in its announcement.
In 2003, Palij’s U.S. citizenship was revoked by a federal judge in the Eastern District of New York, who cited his alleged wartime activities and immigration fraud. A year later, U.S. Immigration Judge Robert Owens ordered Palij’s deportation “to Ukraine, Poland or Germany, or any other country that would admit him,” according to ICE. Palij’s attempts to appeal the decision were denied. 
Palij was not deported sooner because Germany, Poland and Ukraine had refused to take him, The Guardian reported, and the U.S. could not prosecute his alleged war crimes because they took place on foreign soil. In the interim, Palij continued living in a house in Queens, New York, with his wife Maria.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Palij was deported to Germany after “extensive negotiations” between President Donald Trump and his team and German officials. Sanders did not elaborate on the details of the negotiations.
Including Palij, the U.S. government has deported a total of 68 individuals who participated in Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, according to ICE.
Trawniki
An abandoned sugar refinery was occupied by the Nazis from July 1941 to July 1944 and turned into the Trawniki camp. The camp initially served as a holding area for Soviet civilians and soldiers, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
By September 1941, it became a training facility for Nazi law enforcement deployed in “Operation Reinhard,” a mission to kill the roughly 2 million Jewish residents living in German-occupied territory at the time. Between 1941 and 1944, about 5,082 men were trained at Trawniki to fight as Nazi auxiliary forces.
The facility was also used as a forced-labor camp for Jews between June 1942 and September 1943, as part of Operation Reinhard. Between September 1943 and May 1944, it was one of the Nazi regime’s “concentration camps.”
On Nov.  3, 1943, the Nazi’s shot and killed least 6,000 Jewish prisoners housed in Trawniki and its subcamp Dorohucza, as part of “Operation Harvest Festival.”

42022,2018-08-22,Rockets launched toward Afghan presidential palace,"On Tuesday, rockets were launched towards Afghanistan’s presidential palace in Kabul while Afghan President Ashraf Ghani delivered a speech celebrating the Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha. Kabul police said three men armed with guns and mortars broke into a building behind the Eid Gah Mosque and first fired mortars towards the palace, BBC reported. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the mortar attack, according to The Associated Press. The group’s claim has not been independently verified. 
At least 10 explosions occurred during Ghani’s speech, BBC reported.
The rockets reportedly landed in two areas of the capital city: near the presidential palace and an area near a NATO building and the U.S. embassy, police official Jan Agha confirmed. Kabul police reported that there were no injuries from the initial mortar blasts.
According to Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai, authorities tracked down the location where the rockets were suspected to have been launched by following a “suspicious vehicle” to a mud-brick house near the Eid Gah mosque. Once authorities identified the target, an armed helicopter bombed the location, destroying the house and the vehicle, AP reported.
Security forces exchanged gunfire at the building from where the militants launched their attack, BBC reported. Six people, including at least two members of the Afghan security forces, were wounded during the shooting. Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said all the attackers were killed. 
Two days prior, Ghani had requested a ceasefire with the Taliban ahead of the Muslim holiday that, if agreed upon, would have lasted until Nov. 21. The Taliban rejected Ghani’s request on Monday, according to BBC.

41963,2018-08-22,"Rep. Hunter, wife indicted on 60 fraud charges","Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and his wife Margaret Hunter were indicted by a federal grand jury on Tuesday for allegedly misusing more than $250,000 in campaign funds for personal use, such as for family vacations and tuition, and filing false records with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). 
A 47-page indictment lists 60 counts against the Hunters for conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud, falsification of records and prohibited use of campaign contributions. The indictment cites instances from 2009 to 2016. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California said the Hunters used campaign funds to pay for expenses such as family vacations to Hawaii and Italy, travel expenses for relatives, tuition for their children’s private school, dental work, theater tickets, groceries and more. These expenses were mischaracterized under vague or misleading descriptors in FEC filings, the office said. For example, dental work was filed as a charitable contribution to “Smiles for Life,” according to the office. 
“The Hunters spent substantially more than they earned,” the indictment alleged. “They overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times in a seven-year period resulting in approximately $37,761 in ‘overdraft’ and ‘insufficient funds bank’ fees.”
“Today’s indictment is a reminder that no one is above the law,” said U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman, who signed the indictment.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said the allegations against Hunter were “deeply serious,” and that the representative would be removed from committee work while under indictment. 
Hunter, a five-term Republican congressman, is currently up for reelection in the November midterms. Prior to the indictment, Republicans held a 14 point lead in his southern California district, Fox News reported. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday that Ryan should call on Hunter to resign. The San Diego Union-Tribune, the local newspaper in Hunter’s hometown, also called on Hunter to resign in an editorial.
The investigation against Hunter began in June 2016, and the FBI’s San Diego Division raided the Hunters’ home in 2017. 
Earlier this month, Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, sent a letter to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein asking him to postpone the indictment, which followed a more than two-year investigation. The letter said that the Hunters had reimbursed about $60,000 to the campaign in 2017. 
Vega’s letter alleged that the charges were “politically motivated” because Hunter had supported Trump’s candidacy and two prosecutors in the California district supported candidate Hillary Clinton. 
Duncan Hunter, 41, and Margaret Hunter, 43, are scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday morning.

41959,2018-08-22,"Facebook removes ‘inauthentic’ pages, profiles that originated in Iran and Russia","Facebook announced on Tuesday that it removed accounts, groups and pages engaged in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” that “mislead others about who they were and what they were doing.” The social media company said the accounts had originated from separate campaigns in Iran and Russia, adding that it had not found any “link or coordination” between them. The Iranian and Russian governments denied involvement.
The accounts mostly posted political content, including posts and memes about U.S. politics published by some of the Iranian accounts in advance of the 2018 midterm elections. Some accounts also engaged in “traditional cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to hack people’s accounts and spread malware,” Facebook said, adding that it disrupted the attempts. 
Facebook said it coordinated with law enforcement, security experts and other companies to address the misuse of the platform, and thanked other security companies for their work. The social media company also said it monitored some groups for “months” before taking actions to close them in order to gather information about how they operate. 
“There is always a tension between taking down these bad actors quickly and improving our defenses over the long term,” Facebook said. “If we remove them too early, it’s harder to understand their playbook and the extent of their network. It also limits our ability to coordinate with law enforcement, who often have investigations of their own.”
Iran
According to Facebook, the inauthentic posts that originated in Iran “targeted people across multiple internet services in the Middle East, Latin America, UK and US.” For example, these include political posts critical of Israel, the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union, and U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Facebook removed 652 of these pages, groups and accounts, in both English and Arabic. Collectively, these accounts were followed by at least 983,000 other accounts. Some of the inauthentic accounts also spent more than $12,000 on Facebook and Instagram advertising, paid in U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, Turkish lira, and Indian rupees, Facebook said. The company said it had notified the U.S. departments of Treasury and State to evaluate if any sanctions had been violated. Some of the pages also hosted events. 
A spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, Alireza Miryousefi, said, “such claims are ridiculous and are part and parcel of U.S. public calls for regime change in Iran, and are an abuse of social media platforms.” 
Russia
Unrelated to the posts originating in Iran, Facebook said it removed pages, groups and accounts “that can be linked to sources the US government has previously identified as Russian military intelligence services.” The content of these accounts focused on politics in Ukraine and Syria, including content supporting Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Facebook said. 
The social media company noted that some of the owners of the accounts were also allegedly involved in “cybersecurity attacks” before the 2016 U.S. election, adding that the more recent activity did not involve U.S.-specific content. Facebook noted it was continuing to work with U.S. law enforcement on the matter.
In February, the U.S. indicted 13 Russian and three Russian entities with interfering with the 2016 U.S. election, including alleged use of social media platforms such as Facebook to share political content. 
Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia did not understand the basis of Facebook’s accusations, adding that they seemed like a “carbon copy” of allegations Russia already denied.

41947,2018-08-22,Manafort convicted on 8 counts; mistrial declared on 10 counts,"A Virginia jury convicted Paul Manafort, a former campaign chairman for President Donald Trump, on eight of 18 charges against him on Tuesday. The jury could not reach a verdict on the remaining 10 charges, and U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis declared a mistrial on those counts.
Ellis has not yet set a sentencing date.
Manafort's defense lawyer Kevin Downing said in a statement outside the courtroom that Manafort was disappointed that he did not get a complete hung jury and was not acquitted of all the charges. Manafort was “evaluating all his options,” Downing said, adding that his client would “like to thank Judge Ellis for granting him a fair trial.” 
Manafort, 69, was found guilty of five counts of falsifying income tax returns, one count of failing to report his foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud. 
The declaration of a mistrial on the 10 other charges, which include additional charges of bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy and failure to report foreign accounts, allows the prosecution to retry them with another jury. The prosecution has not yet stated whether it would pursue another trial, and has up until Aug. 29 to decide. 
Manafort is scheduled to begin a separate trial on Sept. 17 in a Washington D.C. court. He’s charged in that district with “conspiracy against the United States,” money laundering, being an unregistered agent of a “foreign principal,” making false and misleading statements relating to the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), as well as other false statements. Manafort is also charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice relating to alleged witness tampering.
Responding to a reporter’s question about Manafort’s verdict, Trump said it “has nothing to do with Russian collusion,” and was a continuation of the “witch hunt,” a term he’s repeatedly used to describe Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Trump also called Manafort a “good man” and noted he worked for Ronald Reagan.

41589,2018-08-23,"US, China enact new trade tariffs","The U.S. and China have implemented a previously announced 25 percent tariff on $16 billion worth of goods from each country on Thursday. The tariffs, which were originally announced on Aug. 7, had been scheduled to automatically go into effect at midnight Eastern time in the U.S. and at 12:01 p.m. in Beijing.
The U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods apply to 279 product categories, including semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). China’s tariffs on U.S. goods include 333 U.S. product categories, such as coal, copper scrap, fuel, steel products, buses and medical equipment.
In response to the $16 billion in tariffs, China has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the U.S., claiming it violated trade rules.
Representatives from China met with U.S. officials in Washington this week for negotiations on trade tariffs; any possible outcome or resolution from the talks has not yet been made public.
China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lu Kang, said of the talks, “We hope the U.S. side will get along with us to strive for a good result from the talks with a reasonable and practical attitude.” 
President Donald Trump told Reuters on Monday that he did not “anticipate much” from this week’s tariff talks with China.
Reuters cited an anonymous executive at a “major U.S. manufacturer in China” who suggested that uncertainty about the potential duration of trade negotiations had a greater impact on business than the actual tariffs because it made business planning difficult. It is too early for the tariffs to have a noticeable economic impact, Reuters reported.
US and China’s trading relationship
The U.S. and China have the largest trading relationship of any two countries in the world. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the two countries exchanged about $635 billion worth of goods in 2017. That year, the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $375 billion with China, meaning that the value of goods the U.S. purchased from China was that much higher than the value of the goods China bought from the U.S. 

Of all the goods the U.S. imp orts, 18 percent come from China, and of all the goods the U.S. exports, 8 percent are bought by China, according to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2016 statistics.
An investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) concluded that “the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.” Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to take action against “unfair” or “discriminatory” trade practices, or trade agreement violations. The Trump administration has used the USTR’s findings to justify imposing tariffs on China. 
Recent tariff changes
On July 6, the Trump administration implemented 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports. According to The Associated Press, China responded with retaliatory tariffs on a similar value of goods.
In addition to the $16 billion in tariffs enacted Thursday, the U.S. compiled a list of $200 billion worth of products that could be tariffed as a potential retaliatory measure against China if it decides to impose additional tariffs against the U.S. 
As an act of reciprocity, China responded to the U.S.’ list of $200 billion in goods by announcing its own list of goods on which it may impose tariffs if the U.S. implements its additional tariffs. So far, neither nation has imposed those additional tariffs.

41970,2018-08-23,Trump directs Pompeo to ‘study’ South Africa’s land transfers,"U.S. President Donald Trump directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to “closely study” the “land and farm seizures” and “large scale killing of farmers” in South Africa, the president announced on Twitter on Wednesday night. He did not cite evidence of “large scale” killings. South Africa, which is in the process of amending its constitution to allow redistribution of land from the white minority, responded that Trump was “misinformed,” and said on Twitter the viewpoint “only seeks to divide our nation.” 
The ruling party in South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), is currently going through a process to amend the constitution to allow the government to reallocate land from some white people without compensation. Currently, about 9 percent of the population of South Africa is white, while about 72 percent of the farmland is owned by whites, according to government totals. A law from 1913 had granted the majority of fertile farming land to whites, and land reform has been discussed since the end of Apartheid in 1994. 
In February of this year, the South African parliament voted 241 to 83 to pursue amending the constitution for the proposed land reform. The bill had the ANC’s support, though was introduced by another party. The vote directed a governmental committee to review the constitution and report back to the government by Aug. 30. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the matter would be handled with “care and responsibility” and wouldn’t be a “smash and grab.”
Prior to the plans to change the constitution, starting in 1994, land has been redistributed through a system of volunteer white owners selling to volunteer black buyers. That system has resulted in about 10 percent of white owned land changing to black owners, BBC reported. No land has been transferred from whites to blacks through force, according to the South African government. 
Trump’s tweet
Trump tweeted Wednesday night, “I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. ‘South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.’” The president tagged Fox News and its commentator Tucker Carlson in the tweet. 
Trump’s tweet followed a Carlson segment on Fox News about the land seizures, calling them “racist” and saying they were “stealing” land from whites based on their skin color. The segment also discussed what happened in Zimbabwe when it went through land reform, including violence against white farmers and economic downturn. 
Advocates against land appropriation
The South African non-profit group AfriForum, which advocates for “minority rights,” especially the rights of Afrikaners (Dutch-descended South Africans), said in a statement that it “welcomes” Trump’s statement. Representatives of the group had previously visited the U.S. and met with Carlson and U.S.-based think tank the Cato Institute about the issue, AfriForum said, as well as engaged in other international advocacy.
AfriForum also alleged that the ANC continues to “den[y] the fact that farm murders, which are proportionally significantly higher than SA’s average murder rate, is a unique crisis that requires specific attention.”
Murder rates on farms are the highest they have been since 2011, according to the best available data cited by BBC. Between April 2016 and March 2017, 74 people were murdered on farms (counting all races, and including farm employees and owners), South Africa's Police Service said, up from 58 the prior year. 
The exact number of farmers and farm workers is not known, but based on estimates of the total people employed in agriculture, this would be the equivalent of 9.1 out of every 100,000 people. If it counts only commercial farmers, it would be the equivalent of 156 per 100,000, according to AfriForum. 
In the overall population, in the 2016 to 2017 period more than 19,000 people were murdered, equivalent to about 34 of every 100,000 people. 
Government response
A couple hours after Trump’s comments, the South African government tweeted, “South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past. #landexpropriation,” tagging Trump. The government would “take up the matter through diplomatic channels,” said a spokesperson for President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Earlier this week, Ramaphosa called on parliament to quicken the process of amending the constitution, noting again the land reform would be handled with “care.”
“As South Africans we must move away from this fear psychosis that has been going around, particularly those that have been spreading lies and rumours,” Ramaphosa said. “Organizations like AfriForum going overseas and saying that the ANC is out for a land grab.”

42037,2018-08-24,South African ‘land reform’: A breakdown,"What is South Africa’s ‘land reform’ plan?
South Africa is pursuing a change to its constitution to allow the country to essentially take farmland owned by some white citizens and reallocate it to black citizens, without compensation. South Africa’s current constitution would not allow this specifically, but in February 2018, parliament voted 241 to 83 in favor of pursuing such an amendment, and directed a government committee to review the constitution and respond to the government by the end of August. 
The proposed “land reform” or land “expropriation” would be intended to address inequality in land ownership between minority whites and majority blacks. Currently, about 9 percent of the population of South Africa is white, while about 72 percent of the farmland is owned by whites, according to government totals. This trend resulted largely from historical legal and economic inequality between the races. For instance, the 1913 Native Land Act had granted the majority of the fertile farmland to white people, expelling native Africans from the land. (More on this below.) 
The government has not announced all of the details of how the land expropriation would be achieved. Earlier this year, the government released a draft list of farms that could be expropriated. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said it would be handled with “care and responsibility” and not be a “smash and grab job.”
What is the historical context of South African land ownership?
Let’s look at history. In 1651, Dutch settlers set up a permanent colony in the southern tip of South Africa, following more than a century and a half of sporadic contact between Europeans and local people. This began an era of colonization, European expansion, warring between aboriginal people and Europeans, and slavery (initially with the importing of slaves from elsewhere). In the late 18th century, of the “free population,” only around 15 to 20 percent were “free blacks.”
Then, the British occupied South Africa’s cape in 1795 after a war with the French, and, excluding a four year period, ruled the area. Other areas remained settled by Dutch descendents, known as Boers. The British military expanded further into territories controlled by aboriginal groups (including the Xhosa and San peoples) to control more farmland. Slavery also increased during this time until it was officially abolished between 1834 and 1838 in the British territories. Yet new labor laws (including the Masters and Servants Ordinance of 1841) restricted employee rights, such as imposing criminal penalties on employees breaching contracts and leaving their places of work. 
A war between the British and the Boers at the turn of the century eventually lead to a “reconstruction” period and the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. During this time, a series of laws disfavored non-European descended people and promoted racial segregation. For instance, South Africa had a “pass” system that required non-whites (including black and Indian people) to carry passes with them and restricted their movements. Land ownership was also restricted.
What was the Native Land Act of 1913?
In 1913, the Native Land Act was passed, restricting the land that native people could own to selected areas in “native reserves.” It became illegal for black people to purchase farmland outside of reserves. At the time, Africans comprised more than 67 percent of the population, while the reserves made up only 7.5 percent of the territory (later expanded to 13 percent in 1936). Delegations of South Africans that went to Britain to protest the land act were unsuccessful. 
Sol Plaatje, a African who advocated for the end of the act in Britain and later the U.S., wrote after it passed, “We knew that this law was harsh as its instigators were callous, and we knew that it would … render many poor people homeless, but … we were scarcely prepared for such a rapid and widespread crash as it caused in the lives of the natives.” He cited, for instance, exponential increases in the price of milk and other goods in addition to native people being forced off land. 
The land ownership restrictions remained in place until the end of Apartheid, the country’s system of racial “separateness,” in the 1990s. Racial change was announced in parliament in February 1990, Nelson Mandela was freed, and many of the Apartheid-era policies were repealed the following year. South Africa held its first free election in which the black majority was allowed to vote in 1994, Mandela won as the African National Congress (ANC) candidate, and a constitution was drafted that granted land ownership rights to non-white people. 
What happened after Apartheid? 
South Africa’s constitution, adopted in 1996, outlined the “nation’s commitment to land reform, and to reforms to bring about equitable access to all South Africa’s natural resources,” and committed the state to “take reasonable legislative” measures to ensure equitable land access. The constitution said people dispossessed of their land in 1913 would be entitled to “restitution of that property or to equitable redress,” but did not specifically outline seizure or reappropriation of land from the white minority without their consent. 
Since the end of Apartheid, land has been redistributed through a system of willing white owners selling to willing black buyers. That system has resulted in about 10 percent of white owned land changing to black owners, according to BBC.
Yet given the history of legal and economic inequality, about 72 percent of the farmland remains owned by the white minority. 
Why do supporters of land reform say?
Many people in favor of land reform see it as correcting an historical injustice: essentially taking back property that was unjustly taken. 
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party brought the motion to parliament in February to call for the constitutional amendment. “We must ensure that we restore the dignity of our people without compensating the criminals who stole our land,” EFF leader Julius Malema said.
What do critics of reform say?
Opposition to land reform is argued on different grounds, from moral to economic or practical. Some argue, for instance, that seizing land from whites because of their race is a type of continuation of racism in South Africa (in reverse).
The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, opposed the motion to pursue changing the constitution, arguing that it would damage property rights and could deter international investment. Others have suggested that pursuing the land expropriations could harm the economy through loss of productivity. 
South African non-profit group AfriForum, which says it represents “minority rights,” especially the rights of Afrikaners (Dutch-descended South Africans), has advocated internationally to stop land reform. AfriForum, in part, cites increasing violence against white farmers as a reason to stop the land reform. It argues seizing the land will inspire more violence, similar to what happened in the neighboring country of Zimbabwe when it executed a similar action.

42279,2018-08-25,Senator John McCain dies at 81,"Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) died on Saturday due to complications from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. He is survived by his wife, Cindy, seven children and five grandchildren.
McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma last summer and underwent radiation treatment for the disease. The family announced that he was discontinuing his treatment the Friday before his death.
The six-term senator was a military veteran who spent time as a prisoner of war and unsuccessfully ran for the presidency as the Republican nominee in 2008. He served on several congressional committees. More recently, McCain publicly criticized and opposed some of President Donald Trump’s policies and initiatives. For instance, he voted against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. 
Memorial services will be held at the Arizona State Capitol, the North Phoenix Baptist Church, the U.S. Capitol, and Washington National Cathedral from Aug. 29 through Sept. 1. He will be buried at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.
McCain also wrote a farewell letter to Americans, in which he said it was a “privilege to serve” the U.S., spoke about the “ideals” of America, and thanked his family. A family spokesperson read it at a press conference and his daughter Meghan posted it on Twitter.  
Early life
John McCain was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone to Lieutenant John McCain Jr. and Roberta Wright McCain. He was the family’s second child, born after his older sister, Sandy, and before his younger brother, Joe. McCain’s family moved often as part of his father’s military service, according to his memoir “The Restless Wave.”
During his high school years at Episcopal High School, a private boys’ boarding school in Alexandria, Virginia, McCain participated in the wrestling and football teams. After graduating from high school, he joined the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA). 
McCain’s years in the military 
McCain graduated from the USNA in 1958, after which he pursued training as a naval aviator for two years. He studied at the Pensacola Naval Air Station and the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station. While at Corpus Christi, McCain crashed his plane, a single-engine AD-6 “Skyraider,” into Corpus Christi Bay on a training run. His biography noted that he “came to in time to swim to the surface and return to his quarters in good enough shape to keep his plans for a night on the town.”
After graduating from flight school in 1960, McCain reported for duty at Norfolk Naval Station. He was deployed on the U.S.S. Intrepid for several Mediterranean assignments.
In 1962, he was deployed to the Navy’s first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Enterprise, and later that year was promoted to lieutenant. The U.S.S. Enterprise was involved in the blockade of Cuba during the U.S.-Cuban Missile Crisis.
In 1965, while stationed at the Meridian Naval Air Station, he married Carol Shepp and adopted her two sons from a previous marriage, Doug and Andy. In 1966, he and Carol had a daughter named Sidney. That same year, McCain was deployed to Vietnam for combat duty.
While flying in a mission to bomb a thermal power plant in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1967, McCain’s plane was struck by a surface-to-air missile, causing him to crash. He broke his left arm, his right arm in three places and his right knee during the crash. When he woke up, he was taken by the Vietnamese to Hoa Lo prison, which housed other U.S. pilots captured by the Vietnamese military. 
McCain’s biography noted that he was only taken to a hospital after Vietnamese soldiers learned that his father was an admiral. During his hospital stay, he was interrogated. After unsuccessful attempts at fixing his broken limbs, McCain asked to be sent to a hospital with other U.S. prisoners of war. He was then placed in a cell with two Air Force majors, George Day and Norris Overly, whom McCain said saved his life.
In 1968, the Vietnamese reportedly presented McCain with the opportunity to leave the prison camp in an attempt to embarrass McCain’s father, who was about to assume command of U.S. forces in the Pacific. His biography stated that the Vietnamese wanted to claim that McCain took amnesty while his fellow prisoners, “lacking privileged parents, were left behind to suffer more privation and danger.” McCain refused the offer. 
Over a series of several days, the Vietnamese soldiers allegedly beat McCain until he agreed to confess to “war crimes.” They taped his confession and sent it to McCain’s father. McCain was later moved back to the Hoa Lo prison. 
On March 14, 1973, McCain was released. Upon his arrival back to the U.S., McCain received several military honors: the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts, and the Prisoner-of-War medal.
He was promoted to commander in July 1973, and later enrolled in the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. He studied the history of the French and American wars in Vietnam. 
In 1974, McCain was assigned to the Replacement Air Group VA-174 at Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida. By 1976, he served as the squadron’s commanding officer. In 1980, after failing his flight physical, McCain decided to retire from the Navy and begin a career in politics.
McCain’s years in politics
In 1980, McCain relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, after he divorced his wife, Carol, and married to Cindy Hensley later that year. In 1982, McCain ran for an Arizona Congressional seat and won. 
When then-Senator Barry Goldwater announced that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his term in 1986, McCain decided to run for Goldwater’s seat and ultimately won it. 
During his time as senator, McCain participated in the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, and the Armed Services Committee.
In 1999, McCain attempted to win the Republican nomination for president, and lost to George W. Bush. In 2008, McCain earned the Republican nomination for president but lost the general election against then-Senator Barack Obama. 
McCain stayed on as a U.S. senator. He won each reelection from 1987 until his last election in 2016, for a total of six senate terms.
Responses to his death
Former President George W. Bush’s statement about McCain’s passing read: “Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant, it is hard to think of them stilled. John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order. He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country. And to me, he was a friend whom I'll deeply miss. Laura and I send our heartfelt sympathies to Cindy and the entire McCain family, and our thanks to God for the life of John McCain.”
Former President Obama’s abridged statement said: “Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John’s best, he showed us what that means. And for that, we are all in his debt. Michelle and I sent our most heartfelt condolences to Cindy and her family.”
President Donald Trump’s statement: “My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!”
McCain had reportedly asked that both Obama and Bush speak at his funeral. McCain’s family has asked that Trump not attend his funeral, The Associated Press reported.

42058,2018-08-25,Georgia Election Board votes to not close polling stations,"Georgia’s election board voted on Friday to not close seven of nine polling places in Randolph County ahead of November's midterm elections, after a recommendation in favor of the closures received criticism in the media and by advocacy groups. A consultant hired by the Board of Elections had said the proposed closures would save the county money, while advocacy groups said they could reduce the ability for minorities to vote. 
The vote was unanimously cast by the county’s two election board members: Michele Graham and Scott Peavy.
The original proposal to close polling stations resulted from consultant Mike Malone’ recommendation to close them, when he reportedly said that closing the polling stations would save the county money. Malone also noted that some of the polling stations he suggested for closure did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Malone was hired by the Board of Elections earlier this year after the board’s election supervisor quit. Peavy said Malone came “highly recommended” by Secretary of State Brian Kemp's office. Kemp’s office and his campaign say the office’s elections director had recommended several candidates for the consultant position, the Associated Press reported, not just Malone. 
Kemp, a Republican, is running for governor against Stacey Abrams, a Democrat. Abrams is also the first black woman to win a major party gubernatorial nomination and the first woman to run for governor in the state of Georgia, according to Ballotpedia.
The Board of Elections terminated Malone’s contract on Wednesday. 
Advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) suggested that polling closures could reduce the ability for minorities in the county to vote. On Thursday, the ACLU tweeted a petition asking people to sign if they wanted Peavy to keep the polling stations open. The same day, the CBC also sent a letter to Peavy asking him not the close them. 
“In a county where the median salary is slightly over $30,000 and more than 60 percent African American, this plan appears to be a deliberate effort to disenfranchise an emerging and engaged demographic,” the CBC wrote. Alluding to the Democratic candidate Abrams, the CBC added, “In light of the impending historic gubernatorial election in November, we are deeply concerned that the bedrock tenets of democracy would be under attack should this proposal be adopted and implemented.”
“Today, the Board of Elections, who are empowered to make these decisions, finally did the right thing and rejected this ill-advised, poorly timed proposal from an independent consultant who is not backed by the Secretary of State’s office,” Kemp said in an email to the Associated Press.
In a Facebook post, Abrams attributed the board’s vote to local activists who “organized, collected signatures, and petitioned their elected leaders.”

42056,2018-08-25,Scott Morrison becomes new Australian prime minister,"Scott Morrison became Australia’s new prime minister on Friday, after a Liberal party leadership contest removed Malcolm Turnbull from the position. Morrison, the party’s treasurer, defeated former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton in a 45 to 40 internal Liberal party coalition vote on Friday. In Australia, the leader of the governing party or coalition also becomes the prime minister, rather than the prime minister being directly elected by voters.   
Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, the Queen’s official representative in the Commonwealth country, conducted the ceremony to officially make Morrison Australia’s 30th prime minister. 
“The new generation of Liberal leadership... is on your side,” Morrison said in a speech after the vote. “We’re on your side because we share beliefs and values in common.” He added that the he and the party believe “people should keep more of what they own,” and that people who have come from “so many different parts of the world… ten generations ago or ten minutes ago” should and will “get a fair go” in Australia.
Morrison also said he would “bring our party back together which has been bruised and battered this week.”
After losing the leadership, Turnbull said it had “been such a privilege to be the leader of this great nation.” He said he loved Australia and Australians. 
Previously, Turnbull had described the leadership contests against him as a conservative “insurgency” that was designed to “bring down my prime ministership.” Prior to Friday’s leadership vote, Dutton had unsuccessfully challenged Turnbull in a leadership challenge on Tuesday in a 48 to 35 party vote. 
Turnbull is the fourth prime minister to be removed from leadership within the past decade. He himself took over from Tony Abbott in 2015 after Abbott led for two years. 
Turnbull’s opinion polls have dropped in recent weeks. Newspoll, conducted by news outlet The Australian, showed that dissatisfaction with his leadership increased 18 percentage points from the end of July until mid-August. Last week, Turnbull removed certain carbon emissions reduction requirements from an energy bill, failing to gain the support of his party on the issue. Abbott and other more conservative members of the party argued that the reductions would have economic disadvantages for Australia. 
Turnbull said after the vote he would leave the parliament “soon,” rather than stay on as a House member. A by-election would need to be scheduled to fill his seat.
Dutton said, after losing the leadership contest to Morrison, that he would give the new prime minister “absolute loyalty” to “make sure we win the election” against the opposition party candidate.
The Liberal Party coalition currently holds 76 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. The main opposition party, the Labor party, holds 69, while smaller parties, which often vote with Labor, hold five seats. The next federal election for the House must be held on or before Nov. 2, 2019. Although the government can choose to hold the election before that date, Morrison told reporters that he did not intend to call early elections. 
Based on an aggregate opinion poll compiled by Poll Bludger (using data from six national polls), if the vote were held this week, the Liberal coalition would receive about 48 percent of the vote, and Labor about 52 percent of it. This would translate to the Liberals winning 59 seats, and Labor winning 87 seats, according to the poll. 
Scott Morrison
Morrison, a 50-year-old married father of two, first entered parliament in 2007. He has held previous cabinet positions, and served as the treasurer since 2015. 
The new prime minister, colloquially called “ScoMo,” is often described as a religious conservative and a social conservative. For example, he opposed and ultimately abstained from the vote to legalize same-sex marriage last year. He also supported the country’s “Stop the Boats” anti-immigration policy.

42054,2018-08-25,National Enquirer alleged to have ‘catch-and-kill’ documents on Trump,"The National Enquirer, a tabloid owned by American Media Inc. (AMI), reportedly kept a safe containing records of payments used to silence people who had sold AMI stories on President Donald Trump, The Associated Press first reported Friday. 
The tabloid allegedly bought the rights to stories about Trump and other celebrities with the intention of not publishing them to prevent the stories from being made public. The practice is colloquially known as “catch-and-kill.”
News of the safe was published after The Wall Street Journal and Vanity Fair reported that David Pecker, the chairman of AMI, was granted immunity in exchange for giving prosecutors information about how former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Trump allegedly paid the tabloid to suppress stories. 
Prosecutors said the Enquirer had given the Trump campaign prior notice of potentially damaging stories. In one instance, AMI’s Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard arranged a $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal for the rights to her story about allegedly having an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. Variety reported that the payment was intended to prevent the story from getting published anywhere.
Court papers in the Cohen case obtained by AP said Pecker “offered to help deal with negative stories about [Trump’s] relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.”
According to AP, Pecker and Howard removed the payment records and other documents from the AMI safe in the weeks prior to Trump’s presidential inauguration. People familiar with the documents’ removal did not know whether they were destroyed or moved to a different location.
Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight charges, including tax evasion and campaign finance violations originating from the alleged payments he made to two women with which Trump allegedly had extramarital sex. 
The Department of Justice said the payments to the two women violated campaign finance laws, which limit the amount that an individual can donate to a campaign to $2,700. Under the law, a donation can be considered “expenditures coordinated with a candidate or his political committee.” Presidential candidates and their committees are also prohibited from accepting contributions from individuals that exceed $2,700.
Cohen, who was allegedly involved in the payment made to McDougal, also reportedly paid $130,000 to former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who claimed she had an affair with Trump a decade before he was elected president. Cohen told the judge he made the payments at Trump’s request. Trump has denied having the affairs. 
Cohen and Pecker are reportedly cooperating with federal prosecutors investigating the payments. 
While Trump initially said he did not know about the payment to Clifford, he has since claimed to have found out about it “later on.” Trump also said the payments were not taken from his campaign finances.

42050,2018-08-25,An overview: Storm categories and classifications,"A storm ‘warning’ versus a storm ‘watch’
When a “storm warning” is issued, hurricane or storm conditions are “expected” somewhere within the warning area, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). When a “storm watch” is issued, hurricane conditions are “possible” within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical storm force winds.
Storm categories
The following terms are used by the National Hurricane Center to categorize storms:

Hurricane: Also called a tropical cyclone, a hurricane occurs when the maximum sustained surface wind is 74 mph (119 km/hr) or more. There are five categories of hurricane: 

	 wind speeds of 74 - 95 mph; 
	 wind speeds of 96 - 110 mph; 
	 wind speeds of 110 - 129 mph; 
	 wind speeds of 130 - 156 mph; and 
	 wind speeds greater than 156 mph.

Tropical Depression: A tropical cyclone in which the maximum sustained surface wind speed is 38 mph (or 62 km/hr) or less.

Tropical Storm: A tropical cyclone in which the maximum sustained surface wind speed ranges from 39 mph (or 63 km/hr) to 73 mph (or 118 km/hr).

Maximum Sustained Surface Wind: The standard measure of a tropical cyclone's intensity. When referring to a weather system, it’s the highest one-minute average wind (at an elevation of 10 meters with an unobstructed exposure) associated with that weather system at a particular point in time.

Hurricane categories
The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines the “category” of hurricane (1 through 5), and outlines the potential for property damage based on wind speed. Anything above a Category 2 is considered a “major” storm.
 
Category 1 (74-95 mph): Winds are considered “very dangerous” and may produce “some” damage. NOAA further details the possible damage, saying “well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters.” The agency also notes the potential for broken tree branches and power outages.
 
Category 2 (96-110 mph): NOAA considers these winds “extremely dangerous” with the potential for “extensive” damage, in which “well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage.” Shallow-rooted trees may snap or be uprooted, and power losses may occur.
 
Category 3 (111-129 mph): These winds may cause “devastating” damage, in which “well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends.” NOAA also notes that “many trees” may be snapped or uprooted, and both electricity and water may be unavailable for several days or weeks.
 
Category 4 (130-156 mph): At this level, NOAA predicts “catastrophic” damage in which “well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls.” Due to the increase in the number of downed trees and power lines, the agency says most affected areas will be “uninhabitable for weeks or months.”
 
Category 5 (157 mph or above): Also considered “catastrophic,” NOAA says “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse.” As with Category 4, it says the areas may be uninhabitable for weeks or months due to the degree of possible damage.

42043,2018-08-25,Hurricane Lane causes flash flooding on Hawaii’s Big Island,"Hurricane Lane, A Category 3 hurricane, was projected to move north along the western coast of the Hawaiian islands throughout the day Friday.  The storm caused over two feet of rain and flash flooding on areas of the Big Island Thursday night into Friday morning. The National Weather Service predicted that the storm would turn west away from the islands by Saturday. No injuries have been reported.
At the request of Hawaiian Gov. David Ige, President Donald Trump authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Wednesday to help with “disaster relief efforts” resulting from the hurricane. The Hawaii Department of Transportation reported downed trees, power outages and road closures affecting multiple islands on Thursday as a result of the storm.
Before it leaves the Hawaiian coast, the storm may move over the other main Hawaiian islands. Heavy rains and flooding may still affect the area throughout the weekend. The National Weather Service said Lane may lead “to catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and landslides,” producing total rain accumulations of 10 to 20 inches in some areas and up to 40 inches possible over local portions of the Hawaiian islands in the days to come. 
The National Weather Service also warned of “a prolonged period of high surf” and coastal erosion as a result of the storm: “The combination of storm surge and large breaking waves is expected to raise water levels well above normal tide levels as Hurricane Lane makes its closest approach. This is expected to result in significant beach erosion and overwash onto vulnerable coastal roadways through Saturday.”
A hurricane warning remains in effect for the islands of Oahu, Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe; the islands of Kauai and Niihau are under a hurricane watch. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Big Island.

42303,2018-08-26,"Mnangagwa sworn in as Zimbabwe president, after constitutional court approves his election win","Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in on Sunday, two days after the country’s constitutional court upheld his election victory. Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa had failed to prove his claim that the election was fraudulent, the court ruled. Chamisa did not attend the inauguration, while some other opposition leaders did. 
“The vision of a new and prosperous Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe we want, is a shared one and transcends political party lines,” Mnangagwa said during his inauguration speech. “As your President, I pledge to act fairly and impartially, without fear or favor, as a President of all Zimbabweans. I am your listening President, a servant leader.”
In reference to violence around the election, the president said, “such conduct should be alien and vile to our nature, culture and traditions as the Zimbabwean people.” At least 6 people were killed during the protests following the election.
After the election on July 30, official results were not immediately released and the opposition alleged the delay was to fabricate results. The main opposition party, the MDC, organized protests in the capital city of Harare, which resulted in 6 deaths. The military shot live ammunition at some protesters, after firing warning shots and used a water cannon. Protesters reportedly damaged property, burned tires, threw rocks and blocked streets. 
Then on Aug. 3, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) declared incumbent President Mnangagwa of the Zanu-PF party the winner with 50.8 percent of the vote. Chamisa of the MDC party won 44.3 percent of the vote, according to the ZEC. The MDC filed a complaint with the court.
For the first time since 2012, Zimbabwe permitted election observers from the U.S. and the European Union to monitor the vote. Elmar Brok, leader of the EU’s election observer mission, was critical of the election commission’s “lack of transparency” and noted “some problems around polling stations” on voting day. He also said that “in some senses, up to this point, the conduct of the polls has had a number of positive features,” though said  delays in the election commission releasing official results could result in it losing credibility.
Rights groups also alleged there was state-sponsored vote-buying and intimidation leading up to the election.
“In the rural areas people's houses get burned, destroyed, on account of expressing themselves. It's un-African, it is undemocratic, it is unacceptable,” Chamisa said. “And this is the issue we must be able to resolve, because five years from now, 20 years from now, we will still have a vicious circle of disputed elections.”
The August election was the first since former President Robert Mugabe resigned from office last November after a 37-year rule. He resigned following a military coup took over the government. Zanu-PF then appointed Mnangagwa, who had previously been vice president under Mugabe, as its new leader.

42285,2018-08-27,Pope visits Ireland following new abuse allegations against priests,"Pope Francis conducted Mass at Phoenix Park in Dublin on Sunday to a crowd of hundreds of thousands during his two-day visit to Ireland. Francis’ visit was also met with protests over the Catholic Church’s handling of sexual abuse allegations against priests.
“We ask forgiveness for the cases of abuse in Ireland, the abuse of power, the abuse of conscience and sexual abuse on the part of representatives of the Church,” Francis said at the Mass. “We ask forgiveness for all those times when, as a Church, we did not offer to the survivors of any type of abuse compassion and the pursuit of justice and truth by concrete actions.”
The Catholic Church has been the subject of abuse allegations for several decades. Recently, claims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests have been made in Chile, Australia and the United States. On Aug. 14, a Pennsylvania Grand Jury released a report alleging that over 70 years, 301 priests in the investigated areas in the state sexually abused more than 1000 victims. It estimated the number of victims was in the “thousands.” 
On Sunday,  former Vatican ambassador to Washington, Carlo Maria Viganò, called for Francis to step down as pope, alleging he ignored the ambassador’s report on sexual abuse allegations against U.S.-based Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in 2013. 
When asked about Viganò’s comments during the plane ride back to the Vatican, Francis said, “I will not say a single word on this.” Francis told reporters to “make your own judgement” on Viganò’s statement.
McCarrick, 88, resigned last month over the abuse allegations, which dated back to 1971. The allegations were made through the Archdiocese of New York’s Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program. The program aims to “promote healing and bring closure by providing compensation to victim-survivors of abuse by priests or deacons of the archdiocese.” 
McCarrick, who was secretary to Cardinal Terence Cooke in New York at the time, allegedly grabbed an altar boy’s genitals on two separate occasions. The Archdiocese of New York, who also turned the case over to New York law enforcement, is leading the investigation. 
McCarrick said of the allegations, “While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people.”
McCarrick was also accused of sexual misconduct three times while he served as a bishop in Metuchen and Newark, New Jersey. Two of those cases resulted in settlements with the alleged victims, according to CNN.
Francis visited Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families, a church event held every three years to highlight the “importance of marriage and the family.”
Ireland’s population is more than 78 percent Catholic, according to 2016 Census data, equaling approximately 3.7 million people.

42317,2018-08-27,USDA announces $4.7 billion in first round of aid to farmers affected by trade tariffs,"On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced details of the first round of aid to American farmers to compensate for losses due to retaliatory trade tariffs from China and other foreign countries. The USDA will deliver $4.7 billion to farmers starting next week as part of a aid package announced in July. 
The USDA said the aid would provide a “short-term relief strategy” for “trade damage from unjustified retaliation by foreign nations,” as directed by President Donald Trump. China, which buys the majority of U.S. soybean exports, introduced tariffs on U.S. goods in response to tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. 
The majority of the first round of aid will be granted to soybean farmers, with around $3.6 billion designated to them, followed by $290 million for pork farmers and $277 million for cotton farmers. Cotton, corn, dairy, sorghum (a grain used in animal feed and to make alcohol) and wheat farmers will also receive a smaller share of the aid. 
On Sept. 4, the agency responsible for delivering the aid, the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), will begin taking applications for the first round. To be eligible, farmers from the selected industries must show adjusted gross income for recent tax years of less than $900,000, as well as comply with certain agricultural standards. Maximum payments will be limited to $125,000 per person or legal entity. 
In July, the Trump administration announced a $12 billion aid package for farmers affected by the tariffs. On Monday, the USDA said the aid could reach $12 billion, noting that any future payments would be determined “in the coming months, if warranted.” 
“Early on, the President instructed me, as Secretary of Agriculture, to make sure our farmers did not bear the brunt of unfair retaliatory tariffs,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said on Monday. “After careful analysis by our team at USDA, we have formulated our strategy to mitigate the trade damages sustained by our farmers.” Perdue also said circumstances might change at any time, if conditions with China change. 
Background on the tariffs
Earlier this year, the Trump administration introduced a series of tariffs on China, which then responded with retaliatory tariffs. 
In January, Trump approved tariffs on solar technology and washing machine components, including those from China. In March, the U.S. increased steel and aluminum tariffs, and the following month China implemented tariffs on $2.97 billion worth of U.S. goods, including pork, in response. 
The U.S. then proposed adding a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China responded with plans to implement tariffs on U.S. goods totaling the same amount, including soybeans. Later in April, China also announced a temporary 178 percent deposit on imports of U.S. sorghum in response to what it called “unfair trade practices.” 
In July, the U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods in response to the country’s policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative called those practices “discriminatory” to the U.S. China then imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. imports in response, including on beef, soybeans, dairy and other farm goods.
The U.S.-imposed tariffs are being implemented under section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to take action against “unfair” or “discriminatory” trade practices, or trade agreement violations. Trump has said the tariffs are necessary to address the U.S. trade deficit. He has said “trade wars” are “good” and “easy to win.” 
The U.S. had a goods trade deficit with China of approximately $375 billion in 2017, according to U.S. figures, meaning the U.S. purchased that much more in goods and products from China than China did from the U.S. The deficit was about $185 billion for the first half of 2018. The U.S. and China have the highest volume of trade of any two countries. 
Both countries call the other’s trade practices “unfair.” China has alleged the U.S. tariffs violate the World Trade Organization’s rules.

42312,2018-08-27,"Toyota, Uber announce automated car collaboration","Toyota Motor Corporation and Uber Technologies, Inc. announced plans on Monday to “advance” automated driving technology and increase access to “autonomous ride-sharing.” Toyota said it would invest $500 million in Uber, the world’s largest ride-hailing company.
A joint statement from the companies said technologies from both companies will be integrated into Toyota vehicles specifically designed for autonomous operation and will be deployed on Uber’s ride-sharing network.
The cars would use Uber’s Autonomous Driving System and the Toyota Guardian automated safety system to create “Autono-MaaS” vehicles, which stands for “autonomous-mobility as a service.” The system would be initially deployed on Toyota’s Sienna Minivan line. The companies expect to have the Autono-MaaS vehicles available through Uber’s ride-sharing network by 2021.
Toyota had previously announced a partnership with Uber at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in January. Toyota said at the time it was investing $1 billion into Uber, and collaborating with Uber and other companies to build self-driving technology for passenger and delivery vehicles, for instance ones designed to deliver pizzas. Toyota said it would work on the hardware and software design of “purpose-built” vehicles that would use Toyota’s proprietary Mobility Services Platform technology. The Autono-MaaS vehicles would also use Toyota’s proprietary technology.

42306,2018-08-27,North Carolina 2016 congressional districts ruled unconstitutional (UPDATE),"Federal judges ruled on Monday that North Carolina’s congressional districts were unconstitutional, saying they had a partisan bias. A 2016 plan to redraw congressional districts in the state was ruled as “partisan gerrymander” that diluted the “voting strength of Democratic voters,” according to a three-judge panel for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.
The case was brought against Robert Rucho, the chairman of the North Carolina
Senate Redistricting Committee, by the League of Women Voters of
North Carolina and the non-partisan advocacy group Common Cause.
The 2016 plan redrew the boundaries of 13 congressional districts within North Carolina. According to court documents, the state’s Republican-controlled General Assembly directed those responsible for drawing the 2016 plan to “rely on political data” to draw districts that would “ensure Republican candidates would prevail in the vast majority of the state’s congressional districts, and would continue to do so in future elections.”
The district court concluded that the 2016 plan violated the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment, and Article I of the Constitution. The court said several congressional districts in the state had been drawn using the “cracking” method of redistricting. “Cracking” is when an opposing party’s supporters are spread across multiple districts to dilute their voting power and to make it more difficult to win the most votes in a single district.
The district court had originally ruled against the redistricting plan on Jan. 9, 2018. On July 25, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the district court’s earlier judgment and ordered the court to reexamine its verdict. In Gill v. Whitford, the Supreme Court had outlined the evidence a plaintiff must present to prove that redistricting may dilute an opposition party’s vote, so it directed the district court to reconsider its case using the benchmarks outlined in the Gill v. Whitford ruling.
It is unknown whether the November election would be affected by the court’s ruling. U.S. Circuit Judge Jim Wynn, who wrote the majority opinion, said, “In such circumstances, we decline to rule out the possibility that the state should be enjoined from conducting any further congressional elections using the 2016 plan.” 
“It may be viable for the State to conduct a primary election on Nov. 6, 2018, using a constitutionally compliant congressional districting plan, and then conduct a general election sometime before the new Congress is seated in January 2019.” The judge left that decision to the litigants in the case. Wynn said the litigants had until Aug. 31 to file briefs on how they would like to proceed. 
What is gerrymandering?
Gerrymandering is the act of dividing an area into election districts “to give special advantages to one group,” as defined by Merriam Webster. This can be done through processes known as “packing” or “cracking” when a state’s congressional districts are redrawn.
 
“Packing” is when a district is drawn so that the electorate includes as many members of the opposing party as possible to limit the number of representatives won by that party in other districts. For example, a district could be “packed” with people registered with one party so they win that district by far more than the required 50 percent. This would remove those supporters from other districts in the state so those districts are not as competitive, and can be more easily won by the other party. 

“Cracking” is when the opposing party’s supporters are spread across multiple districts to dilute their voting power and to make it more difficult to win the most votes in a single district. 
What is a congressional district?
Congressional districts are the 435 areas across the U.S. from which members are elected to the House of Representatives. The number, size and shape of congressional districts in each state varies and can change based on population, as determined by U.S. census data gathered every 10 years. Because of this, states need to adjust their districts to ensure that constituents are adequately represented. Each state is responsible for creating and maintaining its congressional districts.
“Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable,” according to the U.S. Census Bureau. “The boundaries and numbers shown for the congressional districts are those specified in the state laws or court orders establishing the districts within each state.”

42300,2018-08-27,"Iran asks international court to suspend US sanctions during trial, separately says it fully controls Persian Gulf","Iranian representatives asked judges at the International Court of Justice at The Hague to suspend U.S. sanctions against Iran, while Iran appeals their legality in the court. The U.S. reimposed the sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The court has not ruled on the suspension request, and may take weeks to do so. Also on Monday, Iran’s military announced it now fully controlled the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than 20 percent of the world’s oil travels. 
Iran argued before the court that the U.S. sanctions violated a 1955 bilateral Treaty of Amity, which the countries signed following the 1953 revolution when the countries were allies. Although diplomatic relations were stopped after the 1979 Iranian revolution, the treaty remained in effect. 
“The subject of the interim request is the imposition and reintroduction of sanctions and the announcement of the intensification of sanctions by the United States that target Iran, Iranian citizens and companies, and non-compensatory losses to the interests and rights of Iran, Iranian citizens and companies,” Mohsen Mohebi, Iran’s representative at the court, at the beginning of the meeting. “These measures are the violations of the 1955 Treaty of Friendship, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights between Iran and the United States of America.”
Mohebi said the sanctions were “intended to damage, as severely as possible, Iran’s economy,” and called them “a naked economic aggression against my country.”
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the court via a letter that Iran’s claims were “meritless,” and an attempt “to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions, including re-imposition of sanctions, which are necessary to protect our national security.”
The U.S. claims the court does not have jurisdiction on the matter. It is scheduled to give arguments on Tuesday. 
Background
President Donald Trump announced in May of this year that he would withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, brokered under Barack Obama, between Iran and 6 other countries. The deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had lifted economic sanctions from Iran in exchange for Iran making limits to its nuclear program and permitting international inspectors to visit nuclear sites. The deal included sunset clauses, or expirations to some of the terms, and did not prevent Iran from developing ballistic missiles, which Trump cited as reasons for the U.S. withdrawal. 
When the U.S. withdrew from the agreement, it announced it would re-impose sanctions on Iran. In July, Iran filed the case at The Hague over the sanctions, claiming they were illegal. That case may take years to adjudicate, The Associated Press reported. 
The first set of U.S. sanctions were reapplied to Iran on Aug. 6. Trump also said in May that he wanted to decrease Iranian oil export to zero, and said the U.S. would consider sanctioning other countries if they continue to purchase Iranian oil. 
At the time of the U.S. withdrawal, Iran said it would remain in the agreement if the other signatories, the U.K, China, France, Germany and Russia, “guaranteed” his country’s interests. The non-American signatories have also met with Iran to try to negotiate compensations to account for the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. 
Control of the Persian Gulf
On Monday, Iran said it had “full command” of the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, with a “round-the-clock” presence. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) naval forces commander, Gen. Alireza Tangsiri, “In the Strait of Hormuz, we control the lanes and the arrival and presence of ships according to the protocol which exists for the country’s waters and coastal strips, where all military and civilian ships and vessels are controlled.” 

The strait has 2-mile-wide shipping lanes going in each direction, and is the main shipping route of Saudi Arabian oil. A 2012 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that a temporary blockade of the strait “could lead to substantial increases in total energy costs.”
Tangsiri said Iranian naval forces were “prepared to defend the waters with their intelligence dominance and monitoring of the enemy’s physical presence,” adding “there is no need for foreigners such as the United States and the countries whose home is not here.”
The U.S. has fleets in the Persian Gulf region, including in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with aircraft carriers, ships, sailors and marines, occasionally engaging with Iranian forces. Between January 2016 to August 2017, an average of 2.5 interactions per month occured between US troops and Iranian maritime forces, according to the U.S navy.
In early August, Iran increased its naval presence in the gulf. An operations with more than 50 small boats, practicing “swarming” drills that could shut down the passage, Fox News reported. 
 U.S. Naval Forces Central Command spokesperson, Lt. Chloe Morgan, said, “The U.S. and our partners provide and promote security and stability in the region on a daily basis.”
Iran said the U.S. “presence in the region is detrimental to security and does not bring about any security,” and was a “ploy” to “have a presence in the region and sell arms.”

42295,2018-08-27,UN panel recommends genocide charges against Myanmar officials,"A United Nations Fact Finding Mission concluded that Myanmar military officials should be prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide for violence taken against the Rohingya people in Rakhine State, according to a report released on Monday. The mission, created by the U.N. Human Rights Council in March 2017, said the actions “undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law” and are similar to other cases in which courts have determined “genocidal intent.” 
Genocide, according the U.N. definition, “occurs when a person commits a prohibited act with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such.” This would include apply to the Myanmar military’s actions against the Rohingya ethnic group in Rakhine and neighboring states, the U.N. mission said. The report estimated 10,000 Rohingya have been killed, calling the estimate “conservative,” and estimated nearly 725,000 have fled to Bangladesh. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced within Myanmar, the report said. 
The Myanmar government denies attacking civilians, and instead says it has only attacked militants it deems as “terrorists.” In January 2018, the military admitted that soldiers unlawfully killed 10 “Bengali terrorists” in September. “The army will take charge of those who are responsible for the killings and who broke the rules of engagement,” the military said. The government had previously said it stopped what it called “clearance operations” in Rakhine State last year. 
The U.N. fact-finding mission interviewed 875 witnesses and victims, as well as analyzing satellite imagery and verifying photos and videos as part of its investigation. It outlined allegations of the military “killing indiscriminately, gang-raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages.” The report said this has occurred with legal impunity in the country. 
“The Rohingya are in a continuing situation of severe systemic and institutionalised oppression from birth to death,” said the chairman of the investigative mission, Marzuki Darusman. The recent military action against them has shown “flagrant disregard for lives” and displayed “extreme levels of brutality,” he added. 
While the report focused on the actions of the military, called the Tatmadaw, it also alleged other security agencies were involved. The report names six generals, including the military commander Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, as “priority subjects” for investigation and prosecution.
Christopher Sidoti, of the committee’s three members, called on the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly to take action based on the report. The report recommended the U.N. impose targeted sanctions against individuals believed to be responsible for the crimes, as well as a general arms embargo against the country. 
“We are convinced the international community holds the key to dismantling the destructive veil of impunity in Myanmar,” Sidoti said.
The U.N. report also recommended that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague, or said an ad hoc international criminal tribunal could be established, so “a competent court can determine [officials’] liability for genocide.” Myanmar has not signed the Rome Statute, the legislation that created the ICC. As a result, the ICC may not have legal jurisdiction to prosecute Myanmar officials. 
The report makes other recommendations as well, including calling on the U.N. to create a trust fund for Rohingya victims of the violence to “receive psychosocial support, legal aid, livelihood support, and others means of assistance.”
The Myanmar government has previously denied widespread abuses, and said it has responded to local violence in the area with “clearance operations” that it says have since stopped. Myanmar also created its own ad hoc court to address the issue, which the U.N. report concluded has not been “impartial, independent [or] effective.” The report also said, “Impunity is deeply entrenched in Myanmar’s political and legal system, effectively placing the Tatmadaw above the law,” citing constitutional protections.
Also on Monday, Facebook announced it was removing accounts and pages of certain Myanmar officials from Facebook and Instagram. Specifically, the company said it removed 20 people and organizations followed by 12 million people collectively, including the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and the military’s television network. Facebook said it wanted to “prevent them from using our service to further inflame ethnic and religious tensions,” and cited the U.N. report that said some of the individuals were responsible for human rights violations.

42292,2018-08-27,"3 dead, 9 wounded in Florida shooting","An armed man killed two people and shot nine others before killing himself on Sunday during a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida. The suspect was identified as David Katz, 24.
The Jacksonville sheriff's office said those wounded by gunshots had been sent to area hospitals and were in stable condition. As of 9:30 a.m. on Monday, the University of Florida Health said four of the six patients it received from the shooting had been discharged. The sheriff’s office did not disclose the names of the hospitals treating the other victims.
The shooting occurred at around 1:34 p.m. Sunday during a “Madden NFL 19” video game tournament being held at a pizzeria in a Jacksonville mall. Police arrived at the scene two minutes later and searched the area for additional suspects. The suspect reportedly used a handgun in the shooting.
According to the sheriff’s office, Katz resided in Baltimore, Maryland, and authorities suspect he stayed somewhere locally the night before the shooting. The FBI is assisting local law enforcement with the investigation.
In a tweet on Sunday night, Jackson Mayor Lenny Curry said, “As the day closes [and] a new day opens, pray for families of the lost, pray for victims being treated. Pray for those that were there [and] experienced this trauma. Pray for medical pros treating victims. Pray for 1st responders that rushed into life threatening chaos. Pray for all of us.”
The video game tournament was sanctioned by game maker EA Sports and had a prize of $5,000 to be divided among the top finalists. The company offered its “deepest sympathies” to those involved.

42330,2018-08-28,Explaining the 3D-printed gun debate,"What is 3D printing?
Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing, involves making a solid object from a computer file. The technology layers material, usually plastic or metal, on top of itself in a three-dimensional space to create the desired object. The technology can allow users to design and make almost any solid object they can imagine within size restrictions. The raw material must also be supplied to the machines, which are controlled from a computer. 
Development of the technology began in the 1980s, and by the end of the decade some industries were using it. 3D printing technology can now be used for a variety of purposes and uses different materials. For example, researchers have successfully 3D printed functioning organs out of human cells. Companies can also 3D print edible chocolates and other items.
3D printing became more widely available over the past decade, with small home-use printers becoming available to the public for a couple hundred dollars, and larger, more elaborate ones for tens of thousands. (Printers capable of printing workable firearms likely cost thousands.)
In addition to 3D printers, there are also CNC milling machines, which can use a variety of materials and metals. In contrast to a 3D printer that adds material to make a part, a milling machine removes material from a starting piece to make a part, using a rotating tool. In other words, it carves out the desired object. 
When did development of 3D-printed guns begin?
The first known 3D-printed gun that successfully fired was made by Cody Wilson in 2013. Wilson, now a 30-year-old Texas man, founded Defense Distributed (DD), a non-profit, open source company that has published 3D-printed gun designs online. According to its website, DD is a “private defense firm principally engaged in the research, design, development, and manufacture of products and services for the benefit of the American rifleman.”
DD shared the designs for the first entirely 3D-printable handgun, “The Liberator,” in 2013, which was downloaded about 100,000 times in only two days. DD has also shared computer-aided design (CAD) files for handguns and rifles, such as AR-15s. To comply with the U.S. Undetectable Firearms Act, which makes all plastic guns illegal, DD’s 3D-printed designs include a metal part. 
Manufacturing the 3D guns is not as simple as “pressing a button and you have a gun,” Wilson has said interviews. Rather, it requires a person to make individual parts and then assemble them together. DD also sells milling machines for $2000, which come with preloaded gun designs and can manufacture each in about two days. 
What’s happened since?
In May 2013, the State Department under the Obama administration sent a letter to DD that instructed the company to stop sharing the file for 3D-printed guns, arguing that the U.S. Arms Export Control Act (AECA) prohibited the distribution of the CAD files from being “exported” abroad via online downloads, without explicit government permission. DD removed the files from its site, although they remained elsewhere online. 
DD, along with non-profit guns rights group the Second Amendment Foundation, filed a suit against the State Department, alleging that its interpretation of AECA was unconstitutional and “prior restraint” on freedom of speech. Prior restraint, in First Amendment law, is “government action that prohibits speech or other expression before the speech happens,” including through the use of injunctions and other means, according to Cornell Law’s Legal Information Institute. Courts “typically” rule such restraint to be unconstitutional, Cornell explained. 
A judge ruled against DD’s request for a preliminary injunction to allow it to post CAD files, saying that while restricting First Amendment freedoms “unquestionably constitute irreparable injury” to the plaintiff, the government’s interest in national security and public interest “essentially collapse” the free speech argument. In an appeal, the decision was upheld, with a judge dissenting. 
A multi-year lawsuit followed, and in June of this year, DD and the State Department reached a settlement agreement, under which DD would be permitted to distribute CAD files for any non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber, including AR-15 semi-automatic sporting rifles. 
Then at the end of July, eight state attorneys general sued to stop the company from being able to post the designs online, and filed a complaint with the court requesting a temporary injunction against DD distributing the designs. On July 31, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the plans from being posted. Prior to the judge’s decision, more than 1,000 people had downloaded the designs. Then on Aug. 27, the judge extended the temporary ban.
On Aug. 28, Wilson announced that DD would begin selling the plans for 3D-printed guns, arguing that the judge’s order blocks the company from giving the plans away for free, but not from selling them.
What do advocates say?
Supporters of 3D-printed guns generally argue that both the First and Second Amendments give them the right to distribute and use the gun plans. Wilson said in an interview with PragerU that the intersection of these two amendments “should” grant his cause greater protections. 
The First Amendment guarantees free speech, which Wilson and his supporters have said grants the right to share CAD files as a part of protected speech. 
“I don't believe that access to information is ever tremendously negative or a bad thing. I know that people can use information for bad things. But this isn't a justification to … stop a publisher from speaking,” Wilson told CNN in an interview.
(Note: The case between the State Department and DD did not specifically answer whether CAD files were protected under the First Amendment. In an unrelated case, one judge concluded only that “code can merit First Amendment protection, although the scope of such protection remains to be determined.” In yet another case, a court ruled that CAD files were purely functional, not language, and thus not protected under the First Amendment. The legal precedent is still unclear, according to Harvard Law Review.)
The Second Amendment reads, “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Courts have debated interpretations of what this means and whether it applies to individuals (“militia” or not). In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly interpreted the amendment as applying to an individual’s right to bear arms for traditionally lawful purposes.
Additionally, some of the arguments in support of 3D-printed guns mirror those of other gun-rights advocates—for instance, the argument that guns are necessary for protection. 
Wilson also describes himself as a “radical individualist” and “anarchist,” and supports open-source information. He does not describe himself as a gun manufacturer, drawing a distinction between producing the plans and the physical weapons. 
“The guns are downloadable,” Wilson said in an interview with CBS News. “The files are in the public domain. You cannot take them back. You can adjust your politics to this reality. You will not ask me to adjust mine.”

What do opponents argue?
Opponents of 3D-printed guns, in addition to those who oppose private gun ownership in general, have three main criticisms of the guns: they do not require background checks to make, they’re untraceable (they do not have serial numbers and are not registered), and they can be undetectable. Since 3D-printed guns do not require background checks, people who are prohibited from purchasing guns legally could still manufacture 3D-printed guns.  
Undetectable guns, sometimes called “ghost guns,” will not be caught by metal detectors if they are made from all plastic. Current U.S. law already prohibits all plastic guns under the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988. That law bans guns that will not be seen by “walk-through metal detectors” standardly calibrated, and would “not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape of the component.” (DD has incorporated a small metal part into designs to be in an attempt to comply with this law.) 
“The president is committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility,” the White House said at the end of July. “In the United States, it is currently illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind — including those made on a 3D printer. The administration supports this nearly two-decade old law. We will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments.”
What has the NRA said on the issue?
The National Rifle Association (NRA), which advocates for gun ownership rights, officially commented on the issue on July 31. 
“Many anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3-D printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms,” the NRA’s legislative director Chris Cox said. “Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years. Federal law passed in 1988, crafted with the NRA’s support, makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive an undetectable firearm.”
Some critics have pointed out that the widespread production and use of 3D-printed guns could be financially detrimental to gun manufacturers. Some accuse the NRA of lobbying on behalf of manufacturers. The NRA denies this, saying it represents the “rights of law-abiding citizens.” 
How many guns are there in the US?
The U.S. has approximately 393 million guns, according to a Small Arms Survey, which may not account for all illegally owned guns. The country has a population of 326 million people, according to the U.S. census. 
These guns are owned by approximately 42 percent of the American population, according to a Gallup poll. That equates to roughly 50 million homes having guns. Gun-owning homes have an average of eight firearms each.   
According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), U.S. gun manufacturers made more than 11 million guns in 2016 alone. 
In 2015, there were 36,252 firearm-related deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control, 12,979 of which were homicides.

42321,2018-08-28,"Company begins selling 3D gun designs, day after US judge blocks distribution pending trial","The owner of a non-profit company that makes designs for 3D-printed firearms began selling gun plans on Tuesday, a day after a federal judge in Seattle extended a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the company from uploading the plans online. Cody Wilson, who runs the Texas-based non-profit Defense Distributed, argued the judge’s order blocks the company from giving the plans away for free, but not from selling them.
“Anyone who wants these files is going to get them. I'm gonna sell it to them, I'm gonna ship them,” Wilson said. “That began this morning. That will never be interrupted. The free exchange of these ideas will never be interrupted.”
Wilson is known to have created the first working 3D-printed gun in 2013, and then began sharing blueprints. In 2013, the government had blocked the company from posting such blueprints. Wilson then sued the government in 2015, and in June of this year, after a multi-year lawsuit, the company came to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State allowing it to post designs online starting on Aug. 1. 
At the end of July, eight state attorneys general sued to stop the company from being able to post the designs online. They argued that 3D-printed plastic firearms are dangerous because they are untraceable (as they do not have serial numbers), can be undetectable (if made with all plastic parts) and do not require background checks to produce. The Undetectable Firearms Act, which is already law, makes all plastic guns illegal. Defense Distributed includes a metal part in their guns in attempt to be compliant with that law. 
On July 31, a federal judge temporarily blocked the plans from being posted. Prior to the judge’s decision, more than 1,000 people had downloaded the designs. Then on Monday, Judge Robert S. Lasnik of the U.S. District Court for Western Washington extended the temporary ban pending the outcome of the trial.
“The court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants’ First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the states are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation,” Lasnik wrote.
Monday’s court order also reads: “Regulation under the [Arms Export Control Act of 1976] means that the files cannot be uploaded to the internet, but they can be emailed, mailed, securely transmitted, or otherwise published within the United States.” The Act prohibits “exporting” weapons to outside the U.S. without prior government permission.  
Although the judge granted the plaintiff's injunction, saying the parties “shall preserve the status quo” until the case is decided, Wilson said he interpreted that section of the ruling to mean he has the legal authority to sell the gun designs. Wilson said he would prefer to give the plans away for free, but is “happy now” to sell them instead. He said customers could name their price.  
Wilson argues that the case is an intersection between the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees free speech, and the Second Amendment, which addresses the “right to bear arms.” He said in an interview with PragerU last week that the two amendments should grant his cause further protection. 
Wilson also noted that manufacturing the 3D guns is as simple as “pressing a button and you have a gun,” and it requires making individual parts and then assembling them. His company also sells milling machines for $2,000 that are pre-loaded with design files. Milling machines can essentially carve away a part of a larger block of material to create an object. Wilson’s machines can be used to create handguns and AR-15-style rifles in about two days. The company has a three-month backlog of orders for the machines, and Wilson says he screens people who want to buy his company’s milling machines. He did not say how he screens them. 
As Wilson has noted, other individuals have also created and distributed 3D gun blueprints online.

42335,2018-08-29,California eliminates cash bail,"California became the first state to eliminate cash bail on Tuesday when Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the California Money Bail Reform Act, which would replace the state’s current system. The law is scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1, 2019. 
The law would establish a new system for determining a defendant’s custody status while they await trial. Under the previous system, the person could not leave jail prior to trial unless he or she paid the bail amount set by a judge. Activists claimed this system disproportionately affected lower-income people who could not afford to pay bail, potentially resulting in loss of employment and other financial hardships as they awaited trial.
Under the new law, a defendant’s potential risk to the public and probability of missing a court date would be the primary determining factor when considering whether to jail them until trial, instead of their ability to pay cash bail.
“Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly,” said Brown.
Brown, California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye and the bill’s authors, Sen. Robert Hertzberg (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblymember Rob Bonta (D-Alameda), worked together to pass the law.
“Abolishing money bail and replacing it with a risk-based system will enhance justice and safety,” Bonta said. “For too long, our system has allowed the wealthy to purchase their freedom regardless of their risk, while the poor who pose no danger languish in jail. No more. Freedom and liberty should never be pay to play.”
California’s American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) branch said the bill didn’t guarantee “fairness” in the pretrial system. “We are disappointed to see Senate Bill 10 signed into law. SB 10 is not the model for pretrial justice and racial equity that California should strive for. It cannot guarantee a substantial reduction in the number of Californians detained while awaiting trial, nor does it sufficiently address racial bias in pretrial decision making,” the ACLU said in a statement.
The law, also known as Senate Bill 10, passed with a vote of 26-12 in the State Senate, and by 42-31 in the General Assembly.

42350,2018-08-30,Former officer sentenced to 15 years for shooting of Jordan Edwards,"A Texas jury sentenced former police officer Roy Oliver on Wednesday to 15 years in prison and fined him $10,000 for fatally shooting 15-year-old Jordan Edwards last year. Edwards was unarmed during the altercation.
The jury had found Oliver, who is white, guilty of murder for shooting Edwards, who is black, on Tuesday. Oliver's legal team said they would appeal the verdict.
Charmaine Edwards, Jordan’s stepmother, told the Associated Press she felt the sentence was too lenient. “He can actually see life again after 15 years and that’s not enough because Jordan can’t see life again.” Oliver’s legal team said he could be eligible for parole after 7 ½ years, AP reported. The prosecution had requested a sentence of 60 years.

The Dallas-based advocacy group Mothers Against Police Brutality issued a statement saying the sentence Oliver received was not “commensurate with his crime,” noting that half of Texas inmates imprisoned for murder are serving sentences “greater than 40 years,” according to National Crime Information Center data submitted by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas said of the verdict: “There is a long history in this country of failing to hold law enforcement responsible for even the gravest abuses of power. The prosecution of Roy Oliver and today’s guilty verdict send a powerful message: Roy Oliver’s actions were murder, and he will be held accountable.”
Police officers are not frequently convicted for on-duty shootings, AP reported. Since 2005, six non-federal police officers have been convicted of murder in such cases, according to data compiled by criminologist and Bowling Green State University professor Phil Stinson. Four of those convictions were overturned.
Background
On April 29, 2017, police responded to a call about underage drinking at a house in the suburb of Balch Springs, Texas. When officers entered the home, they reportedly heard what they described as gunshots coming from outside the house. The people inside the house then began to flee. 
Outside the house, Oliver’s partner Tyler Gross attempted to stop a car containing teenagers from leaving the scene. Gross allegedly broke a passenger window on the car during the altercation. Oliver then fired several shots into the car, shooting Edwards in the back of the head. Edwards was in the front passenger seat of the car at the time of the shooting. 
Oliver initially claimed that he shot at the car because he thought it was going to back up into Gross. Body camera footage showed the car driving away from his partner, not at him, and Gross later testified that he did not feel that his life was in danger and had not felt the need to use his gun.
Oliver was fired by the Balch Springs Police Department shortly after the shooting.

42343,2018-08-30,"Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma primary election results tallied","Arizona, Florida and Oklahoma all held primary elections on Tuesday to determine candidates for each state’s governor, as well as some other state and federal positions. 
Arizona
In Arizona, with 60 percent of precincts reporting, David Garcia was winning the Democratic nomination for the governorship, ahead of Steve Farley and Kelly Fryer. Garcia is a teacher and military veteran. For the Republican nomination for the governorship, incumbent Doug Ducey won over Ken Bennett, with 60 percent of precincts reporting. Ducey, a former business owner, has been governor since 2015.
Arizona also held a primary for the U.S. Senate, where Martha McSally won with nearly 53 percent of the vote, and 95 percent of precincts reporting. McSally, a current member of the U.S. House of Representatives, beat Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio for the nomination. McSally will run to fill the seat vacated when Sen. Jeff Flake retires. 
McSally held a moment of silence for late Arizona Sen. John McCain while accepting the nomination. Gov. Ducey will appoint a replacement for McCain at a later date. 
The Republican primary election for U.S. House Arizona District 1 went to Wendy Rogers, and the Democratic primary for U.S. House Arizona District 2 went to Ann Kirkpatrick. Neither race had an incumbent. 
Florida
In Florida, Andrew Gillum won the Democratic gubernatorial candidacy, with all districts reporting. Gillum is the current mayor of Tallahassee. If elected, Gillum would be the first African-American governor of Florida. (There have been two black U.S. governors in total.) Gillum was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The Republican primary went to Ron DeSantis, a current representative in the U.S. House. DeSantis thanked President Donald Trump for his support, and Trump called the result a “fantastic win” in a tweet.
The Republican nomination for state attorney general went to Ashley B. Moody, who is a judge and has served as an adjunct professor at Stetson University College of Law.
Incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination for his U.S. Senate seat. If he wins, it would be Nelson’s fourth term in the seat. Current Florida Gov. Rick Scott won the Republican nomination for the seat. Trump has endorsed Scott, a navy veteran, former lawyer and former healthcare executive.  
Florida also held primaries for six U.S. House districts. 
Oklahoma
The Republican primary for the governorship went to Kevin Stitt over Mick Cornett, with 87 percent of precincts reporting. Stitt is the founder of Gateway Mortgage Group.
In the Libertarian primary for governor, Chris Powell beat Rex Lawhorn, with 60 percent of the vote. 
Oklahoma’s Republican primary runoff for U.S. House Oklahoma District 1 went to Kevin Hern over Tim Harris. Neither was an incumbent. 
Midterm elections are scheduled for Nov. 6, 2018.

42340,2018-08-30,Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria death toll increased to nearly 3000,"A new study estimated that 2,975 people were killed in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on the U.S. island territory last September, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster in the U.S. in a century. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, raised the official death toll from 64 to match the estimate on Tuesday. 
The study was an independent investigation conducted by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. The researchers said the deaths, which included indirect deaths, occurred over a six month period following the Sept. 20 hurricane due to extended periods of blackouts. Power has still not fully been restored in all areas. 
“That caused a number of issues,” said Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken institute, citing issues such as intense heat without fans or air conditioning and complications to medical conditions. “It’s fairly striking that you have so many households without electricity for so long. That’s unusual in the U.S. after a disaster.”
The risk of deaths in impoverished areas was 45 percent higher, according to the George Washington researchers. Death rates were also higher for people over 65. 
A previous estimate given to Congress had found there were 1,427 more deaths than average in the three-month period following the storm, and research from Harvard released in May suggested there were about 4,600 more deaths than usual following the storm. There is no standardized way to tally disaster-related deaths. The National Hurricane Center counts only direct deaths, such as from drowning and being crushed, while some governments also include indirect deaths linked to the disaster. 
Rosselló had stopped updating the official death toll due to claims the casualty counts were underestimated, and ordered the independent investigation. The first phase, now completed, cost $305,000, and the second phase plans to focus on the causes of death.
“We never anticipated a scenario of zero communication, zero energy, zero highway access,” Rosselló said to reporters while announcing the study’s results on Tuesday. “I think the lesson is to anticipate the worst.” He said he had made “mistakes” and “things could have been handled differently,” adding that his “commitment as governor [was] to accept that criticism, but also [build] upon it.” 
The governor also said that the government had improved communications systems, created a network to distribute food and medicine in the event of another disaster, and was creating a registry of sick or bedridden people who would need urgent care in an emergency. 
Rosselló also noted that 60,000 homes did not yet have adequate roofing for another hurricane. San Juan’s Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz also said most hospitals do not have generators. “San Juan, our hospital has two generators and a 10,000 gallon tank of diesel, so we have done as much as we can do to prepare, but we're not ready,” she said.
Goldman did not disclose details of the methodology used for the research, noting that it would be disclosed when the study is published in a scientific journal.
Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, was estimated to cause more than $100 billion dollars in damage. The island has approximately 3.5 million residents and currently has more than $70 billion in public debt.
Mayor and White House respond
On Wednesday, Yulín Cruz said that while many share responsibility for the deaths, she alleged that “people in power,” including the governor, did not do enough to request aid at the time. 
“The administration killed the Puerto Ricans with neglect,” Cruz alleged. “The Trump administration led us to believe they were helping when they weren't up to par, and they didn't allow other countries to help us.” 
Following the George Washington University report, the White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump “remains proud of all of the work the Federal family undertook to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico.” Trump also told reporters, “We’re still helping Puerto Rico,” saying the federal government did a “fantastic job” in response and “put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico.” He also said it was more difficult to respond to than hurricanes in Florida or Texas because Puerto Rico is an island. 
In October, Congress passed a $36.5 billion dollar hurricane and wildfire relief bill, which directed $18.7 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster relief fund. The FEMA fund would address multiple disasters, not just Puerto Rico. 
In February, the federal government granted a $16 package to Puerto Rico. In December, FEMA announced more than $1 billion in federal aid for Maria survivors, and in March, FEMA announced another $2.2 billion in federal aid to Puerto Rican households and businesses.

42332,2018-08-30,The evolution of the autonomous car,"What are ‘driverless’ and autonomous vehicles?
There are various types of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle technology in existence and development. Terms such as driverless, self-driving, automated and autonomous are often used to describe cars requiring little to no driver involvement. But which is which?
According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), vehicles can be categorized into six automation levels.

	No automation: The driver performs all driving tasks.
	Driver assistance: The driver controls the vehicle, which might contain some driving-assist features such as power steering or braking/accelerating control mechanisms.
	Partial automation: The vehicle contains combined automated functions that can control both steering and braking/acceleration, for example, but the driver must maintain all other driving functions and monitor the vehicle’s performance.
	Conditional automation: The vehicle can perform all driving tasks using an Automated Driving System (ADS) under certain conditions, but the driver must be present to take back control when other circumstances arise.
	High automation: The vehicle’s ADS can perform driving tasks and monitor driving conditions. Certain circumstances may require driver assistance, but it is not necessary for the vehicle to function.
	Full automation: The vehicle’s ADS can perform all driving tasks under any driving condition. A person in the driver seat may act as a passenger.

The NHTSA considers the current level of commercially available vehicle automation to be at “partial automation,” although several automotive and technology companies are developing and testing vehicles with higher levels of automation. The NHTSA estimated that the transportation industry may have fully automated cars by 2025.
Partially automated vehicles can come with several automated features such as lane-keeping assistance, which helps a vehicle stay within traffic lanes unless the blinker is activated; adaptive cruise control, which helps the vehicle maintain driving speeds; automated braking; which activates the brakes on the vehicle if an object such as a pedestrian is detected in front of the car while driving; and automated parking that uses cameras and sensors, along with steering, acceleration and braking technology, to park a car.
What is the automation development process?
Before a fully autonomous car can be developed, technology and auto companies must create compatible autonomous solutions. And since autonomous vehicles may require testing on roads under real-world conditions, the developers and manufacturers often need permission from countries or cities to test their products.
At the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, several car companies announced partnerships with technology companies working toward automation. For example, technology company AImotive, which utilizes cameras and sensors to develop proprietary self-driving solutions, has partnered with Volvo and received autonomous testing licenses in countries such as Hungary, France and California.
A side effect of this development process is the occasional self-driving car accident, which is partly why companies may require approval to test their vehicles on public roads. For example, in 2016, a Tesla Model S Sedan driving in “auto-pilot” mode crashed into the back of a cleaning vehicle, killing the driver. That same year, one of Google’s self-driving cars hit a municipal bus while merging in Mountain View, California, resulting in no injuries. And in March 2018, one of Uber’s cars with a self-driving system hit a pedestrian crossing the street outside of the boundaries of a crosswalk, killing the pedestrian.
What are the pros of autonomous vehicles?
Since fully autonomous vehicles are still being developed and vehicles with partially autonomous modes aren’t widely available to consumers, the benefits of such technology are speculative. Below are some benefits presented by the NHTSA and other organizations.

	Safety: Autonomous vehicles use computers and sensors to determine distance and speed, and can adjust them in relation to other cars or objects on the road. About 94 percent of car crashes are the result of human error, according to the NHTSA. If automated vehicles can reduce human errors, then it may also reduce human error-related car crashes. 
	Cost savings: Fewer accidents may also mean lower healthcare and insurance costs. A 2010 NHTSA study showed car crashes cost $242 billion in “economic activity,” including “$57.6 billion in lost workplace productivity, and $594 billion due to loss of life and decreased quality of life due to injuries.” 
	Time savings: As noted by the Auto Insurance Center, an auto news and information website, if people don’t have to concentrate on driving, they could spend that time doing other activities as they travel.
	Efficiency: NHTSA estimated that if the majority of cars on the road operated autonomously, they might cooperate to reduce traffic congestion. A study by consulting firm McKinsey estimated that transportation made up of majority-autonomous vehicles could reduce daily average travel time by 50 minutes.
	Mobility: Self-driving cars may provide mobility to people who cannot drive due to injury, age, or other factors. A study by the Ruderman Foundation suggested that autonomous cars could help approximately 2 million individuals with disabilities have better access to employment, and fewer missed medical appointments. The study said that of the 57 million people living with a disability in the U.S., about six million of those individuals have difficulty accessing transportation.

What are the cons of autonomous vehicles?
Emerging technology can sometimes have initial costs out of reach to the average consumer, and something as fundamental as transportation may require government intervention. Below are some of the cons of self-driving cars.

	A learning curve: People would have to be taught how to operate and manage an autonomous vehicle, and potentially how to troubleshoot issues that may arise.
	Initial cost: The engineering, power and computer requirements, software, and sensors add up to more than $100,000, according to the Auto Insurance Center, which may be unaffordable for most consumers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in the U.S. for 2016 was $59,039 a year.
	Opt-in requirement: As noted in the “pros” section, most safety and time-saving benefits are based on a scenario in which most vehicles on the road are automated. If most people ultimately don’t opt to own and operate an autonomous vehicle, the risk of human error while driving would still exist.
	Employment: The transportation industry currently employs over five million people in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, including industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of transportation. If some those vehicles become automated, that may require people to seek employment elsewhere.
	Liability: If a car accident does occur, a court or legal authority may have to determine who is at fault: the owner of the vehicle or its manufacturer.
	Road limitations: While autonomous cars can detect traffic lights, they cannot currently detect, for example, traffic cops manually directing traffic during power outages, accidents or other issues. And autonomous cars may not be able to factor in region-specific traffic laws. For example, the legality of turning right when the traffic light is red may vary by state or city.

The NHTSA is also currently reviewing the potential cyber security risks of vehicle automation. “Systems and components that govern safety must be protected from harmful attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or anything else that might interfere with safety functions,” the NHTSA noted. 
The NHTSA encourages the autonomous vehicle industry to adopt certain practices it claims would “improve the cybersecurity posture” of their vehicles.
Which companies are developing autonomous vehicles?
Several automotive, transportation and technology companies are developing autonomous cars or associated technology. Below are a few examples.
Ford plans to have “fully autonomous” vehicles, as defined by the NHTSA, available for ride-sharing services by 2021. The company said its vehicles would operate without a steering wheel, gas pedal or brake pedal. The company plans to work with several technology companies to develop radar technology, 3D mapping, and camera sensors to achieve its goal. According to media site TechWorld, Ford has been testing autonomous cars for 10 years.
Mercedes-Benz, through its parent company Daimler, has been granted permission from the U.S., China and Germany to test its self-driving technology. The company has a goal to put the “first driverless robot taxis on the road in the early 2020s.”
Volkswagen recently partnered with FDTech, which develops autonomous driving systems. Although the companies didn’t give an exact timeframe for releasing their autonomous cars, Karsten Schulze, CEO and co-founder of FDTech, said, “We want to make driverless vehicles available to everyone everywhere.”
Ride-sharing service Uber has been working on autonomous driving technology since 2015. It has partnered with automotive companies such as Toyota and Daimler. Uber launched its first self-driving vehicle pilot program in Pittsburgh in 2016. Companies such as Lyft and Google are also developing autonomous vehicles for ride-sharing applications.

42359,2018-08-31,7 killed in New Mexico bus crash,"At least seven people were killed in northwestern New Mexico when a semi-trailer truck crashed into a Greyhound bus on Thursday, state police said in a statement. The eastbound truck experienced a tire blowout that caused it to cross a highway median into westbound traffic, hitting the bus head-on.
The accident occurred around noon Thursday on Interstate 40 in McKinley County.
The bus was carrying about 49 passengers from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Phoenix, Arizona, according to the Associated Press. New Mexico State Police said most of the passengers were transported to area hospitals “with varying degrees of injuries.” The truck driver sustained “non-life-threatening injuries” during the crash.
Information about the deceased would not be released until families were notified, the police said. 
The New Mexico State Police Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Bureau and the federal National Transportation Safety Board were conducting an investigation and inspection of the semi-truck.

42355,2018-08-31,Trump cancels pay increases for civilian federal employees,"President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a pay increase for civilian federal workers scheduled to go into effect in January. Trump said the raise would have cost the government $25 billion. The president made the announcement in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, which was posted on the White House website. 
Trump said he had the authority to cancel federal increases during a time of “national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the [country’s] general welfare.” Trump said he viewed the pay increase as “inappropriate,” adding, “we must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases.” 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the country’s current federal deficit is $804 billion. (The “deficit” refers to the amount by which expenditures exceed revenue.) U.S. federal public debt is more than $21 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.  
Trump said that canceling pay raises would not affect the government’s ability to “attract and retain a well-qualified federal workforce.” Trump also called for performance-based raises for federal employees to reward “high-performing federal employees and those with critical skill sets.” He did not outline any metrics by which to judge worker performance, and he did not say when such performance-based raises would commence.
In 2010, then-President Barack Obama ordered a two-year pay freeze to help reduce the federal deficit. Obama estimated at the time that the freeze could save $28 billion over a five-year period. In 2013, Congress voted to continue the freeze for another year.

42353,2018-08-31,UN offers escort for Syrian residents ahead of fighting,"The U.N. Special Envoy for Syria offered to personally escort residents of Idlib province to safety before the Syrian government launches an attack on militant groups controlling the region. Idlib province is considered the last major opposition-held area in Syria, and the country’s president, Bashar Assad, was reportedly planning an attack on the area, according to Reuters. 
The U.N.’s Staffan de Mistura said the northwestern province has about 10,000 al-Nusra or al-Qaida members that the U.N. has labeled as “terrorists.” 
Idlib has an estimated population of about 3 million people. According to the U.N., many of Syrian civilians have traveled to Idlib seeking refuge from other conflict zones in the country during Syria’s 7-1/2-year-old civil war. About 500,000 people have reportedly arrived in Idlib over the past six months. The U.N. has said a “full-scale” military operation on Idlib could risk a “humanitarian catastrophe.”
According to the U.N., the militant groups and the Syrian government both have the ability to create chemical weapons. “Avoiding the potential use of chemical weapons is indeed crucial,” de Mistura told reporters. Although the Syrian government has a right to fight “U.N.-identified terrorists” and recover lost territory, there’s “no justification” to using chemical weapons in densely populated areas, de Mistura added. 
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said, “I assure you that we do not have chemical weapons and are not able to use them,” according to Syrian state news agency SANA.
Idlib is currently covered by an ceasefire agreement between Russia, Turkey and Iran. Russia and Iran are allied with the Syrian government and have given it military support in fighting militant groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State. Turkey has militarily supported some of the militant groups that oppose Assad’s government.
When questioned by reporters, de Mistura said he had no “specific information” that an attack on Idlib was imminent. “But I do have eyes and information regarding preparations and build-ups and messages and declarations,” he said, adding that “while we are talking, two of the main guarantors – in this case Turkey and the Russian Federation – are trying and we hope will succeed, in avoiding the worst-case scenario.”
The next U.N.-led meeting to discuss the Syrian war is scheduled for Sept. 10 and 11 in Geneva, Switzerland, with representatives from Russia, Turkey and Iran, de Mistura said.

42348,2018-08-31,"McGahn to leave White House in the fall, Trump says","President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that White House counsel Don McGahn would leave his position in the fall. Trump reportedly did not inform McGahn before he made the announcement through his personal Twitter account, according to The New York Times. McGahn has not yet publicly commented on his departure.
“White House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!” Trump tweeted. 
On Aug. 18, the Times reported that McGahn had cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. The Times noted that McGahn’s cooperation was part of a decision made by Trump’s legal team last September. 
In a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday, Trump called McGahn an “excellent guy” and speculated that McGahn may enter the private sector after his departure.
Earlier Wednesday and prior to Trump’s tweet, Axios reported that McGahn would leave after Kavanaugh’s confirmation or after the midterm election.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement after Trump’s announcement, calling McGahn the “most impressive” White House counsel during his lifetime. “His departure from the White House, whenever that may be, would be a big loss for the Trump Administration and the country. Don’s significance to the judiciary, the White House and the nation cannot be overstated, and I look forward to his continued efforts on behalf of our country,” McConnell added.
Prior to serving as the White House legal counsel, McGahn represented the Trump campaign through the law firm Jones Day.

42372,2018-09-01,"US associate of Manafort, Kilimnik pleads guilty to FARA violation","Samuel Patten, a political consultant who worked with both Paul Manafort and Russian national Konstantin Kilimnik, pleaded guilty on Friday to failing to register as a lobbyist in the U.S. for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. Patten, 47, is reportedly cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigative team. Mueller has referred Patten’s case to prosecutors in Washington, D.C.
Patten admitted to working with a Russian national to lobby for a pro-Russian political party, the Opposition Bloc, between 2014 and 2018 without registering as a foreign agent, which is required by law under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a fine of not more than $250,000. 
The indictment did not name the Russian national with whom Patten worked. Reuters reported that the Russian may be Kilimnik, with whom Patten created a political advisory firm called Begemot Ventures Ltd LLC in Feb. 2015. Patten’s company reportedly received over $1,000,000 for its work for the Opposition Bloc and other Ukraine-related consulting work, according to the indictment.
Mueller indicted both Kilimnik and Manafort on June 8, 2018, on obstruction of justice charges for alleged witness tampering. Manafort’s trial for those charges, among others, is scheduled for Sept. 17 in a Washington D.C. court.
As part of his plea deal, Patten also admitted to arranging a payment to President Donald Trump's Presidential Inauguration Committee from a Ukrainian client in exchange for tickets to the event. Patten reportedly solicited a U.S. citizen to act as a “straw purchaser” to buy four tickets totaling $50,000 to Trump’s inauguration in Jan. 2017 for a Ukrainian businessman who wanted to attend the event. U.S. law prohibits foreigners from contributing to a president’s inauguration committee. 
In an archived web page detailing his lobbying work, Patten said he counseled “elected officials, opposition leaders, and human rights activists in Albania, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan [sic], Nigeria, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, and elsewhere.”
The case was filed by U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu in Washington, D.C. Patten pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who will oversee Manafort’s upcoming trial, according to Reuters. Patten was released after surrendering his passport; he cannot travel outside the Washington area without first notifying the court. 
A sentencing date has not yet been set.

42368,2018-09-01,Coca-Cola to buy UK-based coffee chain,"The Coca-Cola Company on Friday announced that it reached an agreement to acquire London-based coffee chain Costa Limited. Valued at $5.1 billion (£3.9 billion), the acquisition includes about 4,000 Costa retail outlets, a coffee vending operation and Costa’s coffee bean roastery.
Coca-Cola said the acquisition would give the company a “strong coffee platform across parts of Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, with the opportunity for additional expansion.” 
Costa won’t be the company’s first coffee business. Coca-Cola Japan has sold Georgia brand canned coffee since 1975. The company also sells coffee under the Gold Peak brand.
“Costa gives Coca-Cola new capabilities and expertise in coffee, and our system can create opportunities to grow the Costa brand worldwide,” said Coca-Cola President and CEO James Quincey. “Hot beverages is one of the few segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand. Costa gives us access to this market with a strong coffee platform.”
The Coca-Cola Company would acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Costa Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Whitbread PLC. The acquisition is pending Whitbread shareholder approval, which the company expects to take place by mid-October. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019, according to a statement issued by Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola sells over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories.

42363,2018-09-01,Militant groups in Syria destroy two bridges,"Militant groups in Syria blew up two bridges Friday that link areas they control to government-held territories in the northwestern al-Ghab plains area, near Hama. The militant groups destroyed the Beit Ras and al-Sharia bridges, which connect territory they control with the government-controlled villages of al-Jeed and al-Karim. 
The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bridge detonations were a response to an increase in military reinforcements allied with the Syrian government sent to areas such as Hama and Idlib. (The city of Idlib is about 60 miles north of the city of Hama.) The Syrian government has reportedly sent tens of thousands of armed troops and deployed more than 2,000 armored vehicles to the area in recent weeks, according to the Observatory.
Reuters reported on Thursday that the Syrian government was planning an attack on Idlib, which the outlet described as the last major opposition-held area in Syria. Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, has conducted airstrikes in the area in recent months, and says a military operation in the area is necessary to remove the “terrorists” it says attacked Russian military bases. 
“The Syrian command has taken a decision to defeat al-Nusra Front in Idlib no matter the sacrifices that it would entail,” Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said on Thursday. Al-Nusra is an al-Qaida-linked militant group considered to be “terrorists” by the U.N. and some countries. 
About 3 million people live in Idlib and surrounding areas, and some of them have already been displaced and relocated there since the beginning of the war more than seven years ago, the Associated Press reported. 
While al-Qaida-linked groups control much of Idlib province, groups supported by Turkey and independent Islamist opposition groups also control parts of the region, AP reported. The Observatory did not specify which militant group reportedly destroyed the bridges.
Two other bridges remain in the area and could be used by government forces to move into territory controlled by militant groups, said Rami Abdurrahman, head of war monitoring for the Observatory.
The Observatory reported that several bridges have been destroyed in the area over the years by both militant and government forces in an attempt to fortify controlled territory from attack.

42406,2018-09-03,A timeline of ‘sonic attacks’ on US diplomats,"In September 2018, Douglas Smith, a U.S. neurosurgery scientist and the director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair, publicly discussed the possibility that a microwave radiation weapon was used to attack U.S. diplomats and their families in Cuba and China. The incidents began almost two years earlier, and resulted in nausea, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, sleep problems and hearing loss for some diplomats. Here is a timeline of what happened:
November 2016: Diplomatic staff in Cuba start to experience neurological symptoms associated with exposure to “auditory and sensory phenomena,” according to a report issued by the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Brain Injury and Repair.
February - April 2017: Doctors at the University of Miami evaluate 80 “embassy community members” and identify 16 individuals with neurological signs and symptoms similar to those following mild traumatic brain injuries such as a concussion.
May 23, 2017: In response to the alleged attacks, the U.S. State Department asks two officials with the Cuban embassy in the U.S. to leave the country.
July 2017: The State Department’s Bureau of Medical Services concludes that the symptoms were most likely related to “neurotrauma from a nonnatural source” and recommends continuing the investigation.
Sept. 29, 2017: The State Department announces diplomatic staff reductions in Havana in response to the alleged attacks, citing the need to protect the “health, safety, and well-being” of embassy staff.

Oct. 3, 2017: Then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announces the expulsion of 15 Cuban diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Cuba, citing the country’s “failure” to protect U.S. diplomats.
March 20, 2018: Douglas Smith and his associates publish a report on the alleged attack on U.S. diplomats in Cuba. The report does not determine a cause for the diplomats’ neurological symptoms.
May 16, 2018: A U.S. government employee serving in China is “medically-confirmed” to have similar neurological symptoms as the U.S. diplomats who were stationed in Cuba.
May 23, 2018: The State Department establishes a “multi-agency” task force to investigate the alleged attacks in both Cuba and China.
June 5, 2018: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces that 24 U.S. government personnel and family members who served in Cuba have been “medically-confirmed” as having symptoms “similar to those noted following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury.”
Sept. 1, 2018: In an interview with The New York Times, Smith discusses the possibility that a microwave weapon is responsible for the alleged attacks on U.S. diplomatic staff and family members.

42402,2018-09-03,Scientists suspect microwave radiation in alleged ‘sonic attacks’ on US diplomats,"The “sonic attack” allegedly carried out against U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China may be linked to microwave radiation, according to a New York Times report. Douglas Smith, the lead author of a scientific study on the alleged attacks, said in an interview with the Times that microwaves were now considered “a main suspect.” 
Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation transmitted in waves or particles at different wavelengths and frequencies. Microwaves can be used to cook food (in microwave ovens), and to transmit mobile phone calls and radio signals. 
The first reported attacks on U.S. diplomats occurred in Cuba in November 2016 after the U.S. presidential election. American diplomats and their families claimed they heard high-pitched sounds in their residences, and reported symptoms such as nausea, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, sleep problems and hearing loss. In May 2018, a U.S. consulate staffer in China reported similar symptoms.
A group of scientists and doctors from the University of Pennsylvania, including Smith, later reviewed the symptoms of 21 diplomats who served in Cuba. The group issued its findings in March 2018, saying the apparent injuries the diplomats sustained had an “unclear origin.” The study did not detail the number or suspected frequency of attacks that may have occurred.
While the study did not mention the possibility of a microwave weapon, Smith told the Times that he and his colleagues now suspect microwave radiation to be responsible for the injuries.
“Everybody was relatively skeptical at first,” Smith said of the microwave theory. “And everyone now agrees there's something there.” According to U.S.-based scientist Allan Frey, microwaves can trick the brain into perceiving sounds that aren’t heard by the ear and induce “sonic delusions.” 
The Times reported that both U.S. and Russian governments have studied the concept of microwave weapons. In 2014, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) confirmed that an undisclosed “hostile country” may have a “high-powered microwave system weapon” with the ability to “weaken, intimidate, or kill an enemy over time and without leaving evidence.”
When the Times asked the U.S. State Department about the microwave theory, it said the investigation had not yet identified the cause or source of the alleged attacks.

42423,2018-09-04,Arizona governor names McCain replacement,"The governor of Arizona on Tuesday named former Sen. Jon Kyl to fill the late John McCain’s U.S. Senate seat, following McCain’s death in August. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, said Kyl would serve as the state’s U.S. senator until at least the end of this year. 
“I am deeply grateful to Senator Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and colleague of so many years,” said Ducey. “Every single day that Jon Kyl represents Arizona in the United States Senate is a day when our state is being well-served.”
Kyl, 76, represented Arizona as a Republican in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to January 2013, and in the U.S. House of Representatives before that, from 1987 to 1995. Kyl had reportedly retired to spend more time with his family, The Associated Press reported. Kyl worked alongside McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake, who had announced his retirement last October.
Kyl said he would “do his best” to represent Arizona, adding, “There is much unfinished business, including confirmation of President [Donald] Trump’s nominees for judicial and executive branch positions, and I look forward to getting to work on behalf of my fellow Arizonans.” Kyl reportedly plans to vote in favor of Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
McCain’s wife, Cindy responded to the announcement, tweeting, “Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John’s. It’s a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.”
McCain passed away on Aug. 25 due to complications from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.

42419,2018-09-04,Russia tells Google not to interfere in elections,"Russia said on Tuesday that its Central Election Commission (CEC) sent a letter to Google instructing the Internet technology company not to spread information about election-related protests in the country ahead of its regional elections planned for Sept. 9.
CEC member Alexander Klyukin told Russian state news agency TASS that Alexei Navalny, a political opponent of President Vladimir Putin’s, wanted to purchase Google advertising tools to post information on YouTube about political protest activities he allegedly planned for the regional election, in what the government said was a violation of a Russian federal law. Political protests on an election day are prohibited in Russia, news outlet AFP reported. 

Klyukin also said that election “meddling” by a foreign company is not permitted in Russia. Google did not respond to a request for comment by AFP.
Russia’s regional elections in September include 22 gubernatorial races, 16 parliamentary races and several municipal elections.

Background
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded with “high confidence” that the Russian government ordered an influence campaign into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. agencies also alleged that Russian companies stole and leaked information from American political groups, including the Democratic National Committee, prior to the election.
Navalny has protested Putin and his government for several years, including a protest in June 2017 that resulted in his arrest. Navalny attempted to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was denied participation by the electoral commission due to a prior embezzlement conviction. Navalny, who says the conviction is without merit, called for Russians to boycott the election. Putin ultimately won the election with about 76 percent of the vote.
Navalny is currently serving a 30-day prison sentence for reportedly violating public order laws during an earlier protest, AFP reported.

42415,2018-09-04,"Russian airstrikes in Idlib, Syria kill at least 4","Russian warplanes reportedly carried out airstrikes in the Syrian province of Idlib on Tuesday, killing at least four people, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The airstrikes were the first such attacks by Russian warplanes in three weeks, BBC reported. The death toll is expected to rise, the Observatory reported.
Last week, Reuters reported that the Syrian government was planning an attack on Idlib, which the outlet described as the last major opposition-held area in Syria. Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, said on Tuesday that Idlib province was a “nest of terrorism,” adding that the presence of militants in the area could undermine the Syrian “peace process.”
“A fairly large group of terrorists has settled there and of course this leads to a general destabilization of the situation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “It undermines attempts to bring the situation onto the track of a political-diplomatic settlement.” 
The U.N. has said a “full-scale” military operation on Idlib could risk a “humanitarian catastrophe.” About 3 million people live in Idlib and surrounding areas, and some of them have already been displaced and relocated there since the beginning of the war more than seven years ago, the Associated Press reported.
On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that he opposed any airstrikes in the region. “President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province,” Trump wrote. “The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don’t let that happen!”
The Observatory reported on Tuesday that the Russian warplanes carried out about 38 raids across 20 different militant-held areas in the western countryside of Idlib and surrounding areas in the northeastern countryside of Lattakia province.

42412,2018-09-04,Typhoon Jebi kills 7 in Japan,"Typhoon Jebi impacted the western part of Japan on Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring more than 200 others. The storm is reportedly the strongest the country has experienced in 25 years. 
The typhoon first made landfall on Japan’s southwestern island of Shikoku. The Japan Meteorological Agency projected the storm would move north-northeast over the Sea of Japan. By Tuesday evening local time, the storm sustained winds of 78 miles per hour (126 km per hour) and gusts of up to 110 mph (180 kmph). The agency predicted heavy rains, strong winds and mudslides across the country's western and northeastern regions.
The storm’s winds caused a tanker ship stationed in Osaka Bay to crash into the only bridge connecting Kansai International Airport to the country’s mainland, damaging the bridge and disrupting airport access. Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism closed the airport due to excessive flooding. Airport officials estimated that about 5,000 people remained stranded at the airport, adding that flights may resume by Wednesday.
At least 1.6 million households were without power in Osaka, Kyoto and four other districts late Tuesday, according to Kansai Electric Power Co. Other airports and mass transit operations in Japan stopped service ahead of the storm.
In July of this year, a series of typhoons made landfall in Japan, resulting in flooding and mudslide that killed about 220 people, according to the Japan Times. 
The strength of Typhoon Jebi was projected to decline by Wednesday.

42409,2018-09-04,Myanmar court sentences Reuters reporters to 7 years in jail,"A Myanmar judge on Monday found two Reuters journalists guilty of breaching a law on state secrets for illegally possessing state documents. The two journalists, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were sentenced to seven years in prison. They can appeal the decision to a regional court.
The reporters had pleaded not guilty and alleged that they were framed by the police, according to The Associated Press.
Judge Ye Lwin said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo violated the Official Secrets Act when they reportedly obtained confidential documents from police. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been reporting on the country’s treatment and alleged killing of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State.
The U.S., United Nations and other countries recently accused Myanmar military and police commanders of “ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya people in Rakhine state. An estimated 700,000 Rohingya have left their homes since 2017.
“Today is a sad day for Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and the press everywhere,” Reuters editor in chief Stephen Adler said in a statement. “We will not wait while Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo suffer this injustice and will evaluate how to proceed in the coming days, including whether to seek relief in an international forum.”
Nonprofit organization Amnesty International called for the journalists’ release and suggested the sentence may have been an attempt to censor the country’s media. “This politically-motivated decision has significant ramifications for press freedom in Myanmar,” Amnesty International director of crisis response Tirana Hassan said, “It sends a stark warning to other journalists in the country of the severe consequences that await should they look too closely at military abuses. This amounts to censorship through fear.”
The journalists had testified that two police officials handed them papers at a restaurant in the city of Yangon right before other police officers arrested them. A police witness at the trial corroborated the journalists’ account, saying the restaurant encounter was a set-up to punish them for reporting on the killing of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine, according to Reuters.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on Dec. 12 while investigating alleged abuses committed by Myanmar soldiers, including the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys in a Rakhine state village called Inn Din. 
The Myanmar government has denied allegations of abuse and denied that it has attacked civilians. The government has described its actions against the Rohingya in Rakhine State as counter-insurgency operations against militant “terrorist” groups.

42398,2018-09-04,Fire destroys parts of Brazil’s National Museum,"After a fire destroyed sections of the 200-year-old National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Sunday evening, the museum issued a statement Monday saying that prior to the fire it was in the process of “modernizing” the facility. The plans included an upgrade to the museum’s fire prevention system, and negotiations for the upgrade started in 2015, the museum said in a statement. It reported no casualties from the fire. 
Part of the city’s Federal University, the museum housed Egyptian and Greco-Roman artifacts, a 12,000 year-old skeleton, fossils, dinosaurs, and a meteorite found in 1784, among other exhibits. The building was formerly a royal palace and was converted to a museum 200 years ago.
The fire started around 7:20 p.m. local time Sunday after the museum had closed. Much of its archive of 20 million items is believed to have been destroyed, The Guardian reported. 
The fire’s cause has not yet been determined; the museum called for federal police to investigate the “rapid propagation of the flames.”
The museum’s statement called for a change in the way the government funds federal universities and suggested it had been trying to attain funding for upgrades to the building for several years. 
“This devastating moment should be an alert for the country's democratic forces, in the sense of preserving the nation's cultural heritage,” a translated version of the statement said. “The inadmissible event that affected the National Museum of UFRJ [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro] has clearly identifiable causes. It is a country project that reduces our memory to the ashes. We would like Brazilian society to join the university and scientific community to help change the treatment of education, memory, culture and science in Brazil.”
On Sunday, Brazilian President Michel Temer tweeted about the fire, calling the loss of the museum's collection “unforgettable.” Temer noted, in Portuguese, that “200 years of work, research and knowledge have been lost. The value of our history can not be measured by the damage to the building that housed the royal family during the Empire. It's a sad day for all Brazilians.”

42433,2018-09-06,The legality and illegality of homosexuality around the world,"Homosexuality is treated quite differently throughout the world. In more than one-third of countries, homosexual sex acts are criminal (and in about 4 percent of countries, they are punishable by death). Conversely, in just over one-quarter of the world’s countries, same-sex marriage or civil partnerships are legal. And in between the two extremes lies a wide array of other forms of discrimination and protection.
Legislation regarding same-sex relations has changed significantly over the centuries. In 1791, France became the first country to decriminalize same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults with the adoption of a new penal code, which also applied to many of its colonized countries.
A number of countries decriminalized same-sex sexual acts throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Some countries also formally criminalized same-sex relations in their penal codes during that period.
In the 21st century, the Netherlands became the first country to formally legalize same-sex marriage in 2000, with the legislation going into effect in 2001. The country was followed by Belgium, Canada and Spain over the next few years. The U.S. joined them in 2015 with a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the country. Last year, Australia, Germany and the European island country of Malta all legalized same-sex partnerships or civil unions. 
Same-sex marriage is legal in 22 countries, according to a 2017 International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) report. Additionally, another 28 allow for a legal civil partnership or civil union of same-sex couples — some offering the same rights as in marriages. (Of these 50 countries, 26 also allow for joint adoption of children by same-sex couples.)
Criminalization, legality and protections around the globe

Death penalty for same-sex acts (including in only specific areas)
Same-sex sexual acts are illegal
Discriminatory laws against homosexual people or LGBT organizations
Some discrimination or prohibition, some protections
Neither notable legal protections nor criminalization
Legal protections against discrimination
Same-sex marriage or civil unions are legal
Breakdown of categories
 Death penalty for same-sex acts 
These countries have laws allowing for capital punishment for same-sex sexual acts, and known cases of executions. In some of the countries, the death penalty for same-sex sexual acts is only applicable in certain regions.
 Same-sex sexual acts are illegal
Laws in these countries criminalize same-sex sex acts, either for men or both men and women. Penalties for convictions on these offenses can include months or years in prison. A few of these countries also have the death penalty on the books, but do not enforce it.
 Discriminatory laws against homosexual people or LGBT organizations
While same-sex relations are not specifically criminal in these countries, they have discriminatory laws against either homosexual people or LGBT organizations. For example, laws may prohibit public displays of affection by same-sex couples, disallow NGOs that advocate for same-sex rights, or other forms of discrimination.
Some discrimination or prohibition, some protections
There is both protection and discrimination in these countries. For example, in Botswana, same-sex sexual acts for both men and women are illegal under the 1964 Penal Code, yet there is also a 2010 law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
Neither notable legal protections nor criminalization
None of these countries have laws that criminalize same-sex sexual behavior. They also do not have laws expressly protecting rights of homosexual people.
 Legal protections against discrimination
These countries have explicit laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexuality — either equal rights guarantees in their constitutions, anti-hate crime laws, anti-discrimination laws for employment, or other protections.
 Same-sex marriage or civil unions legal
In addition to having other legal protections for people on the basis or sexual orientation, these countries have legalized either same sex-marriage or same-sex civil partnerships.
Criminalization of same-sex sexual acts
As of last year, there were 72 countries where same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults were criminal, either for only men (27) or both men and women (45). That’s equivalent to roughly 37 percent of the countries in the world. In 2018, India’s Supreme Court overturned the law prohibiting consensual, adult same-sex relations, reducing the number of countries to 71. 
The language of the laws that prohibit sexual acts between members of the same sex vary throughout the world: some prohibit any sexual act, some sodomy (anal sex), some buggery (anal or oral sex), some prohibit acts “against nature,” or use other wording. Globally, punishment for such offenses can vary from public lashings to prison time, and in some cases include capital punishment.
Of the 72 countries where same-sex sex acts are illegal, eight also carry out capital punishment for same-sex sexual intercourse in at least some areas. The countries are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, specific provinces of Somalia and Nigeria, as well as areas of Iraq and Syria controlled by the Islamic State.
Additionally, five other countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Mauritania, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates) have laws that technically allow for capital punishment for same-sex sexual acts, but are not believed to have carried out official executions in relation to these laws in recent decades, the ILGA reported. In the Asian country of Brunei Darussalam, a proposed law would allow for the death penalty for same-sex sexual acts; the legislation has not been finalized.
Legal discrimination
Legal discrimination can come in different forms — from restrictions on assembly to banning public expression of homosexual acts of identity (such as pride parades or holding hands between same-sex partners) to denying organizations that advocate for LGBT rights NGO status.
In Russia, for instance, while same-sex sexual acts were decriminalized in 1993, various “promotion” or “morality” laws prohibit expression of homosexual identity or advocacy work. A law prohibiting the “Promotion of Non-Traditional Sexual Relations Among Minors” was used to prosecute members of a St. Petersburg-based LGBT youth organization. Certain expressions of homosexual activity in public are punishable by jail time. Russia also drafted a U.N. resolution to deny benefits to same-sex partners of U.N. staff members.
Legal protections
More than one-third of the countries in the world have some explicit legal protections for homosexual people, according to data from ILGA.
Nine countries explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in their constitutions. For example, Mexico’s constitution prohibits discrimination based on “sexual preferences.” In other countries, such as Canada, while the constitution’s wording does not explicitly mention sexual orientation, case law has established that equal rights and protections apply on this basis.
In September 2018, India’s Supreme Court ruled that all constitutional protections should apply to homosexual people and that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is illegal. The decision overturned a law that banned same-sex sexual acts.
Globally, in 2017, there were laws prohibiting certain workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in 72 U.N. member states, as well as in Taiwan. 
Additionally, 43 countries in 2017 had laws against “hate crimes” that target people on the basis of sexual identity, and 39 countries had laws banning actions that incite hate towards homosexual people.
Non-legal forms of violence and discrimination
Legality is one thing, but discrimination and violence can come outside of the dictates of law. In the extreme, this can include extrajudicial killings and other “hate crimes” against people who are homosexual or perceived to be homosexual.
In Russia, aside from the discriminatory laws mentioned above, extrajudicial discriminations and violence have been reported. In 2017, a Russian newspaper reported that authorities engaged in extrajudicial imprisonment and torture of at least 100 men believed to be homosexual in Chechnya, in southern Russia. One anonymous Chechen man who was allegedly detained illegally told CNN in an interview that he was beaten and electrocuted.
The Russian news report alleged that the authorities illegally executed 27 of the men one night. Apart from authorities engaging in violence, civilians in the area have engaged in hate crimes against those believes to be homosexuals. One Chechen man told CNN that he feared that his family would murder him if they found out he was homosexual.
In the U.S., according to the FBI’s 2016 “hate crime” statistics, 16.7 percent of reported hate crimes were committed due to sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation, totaling 1,255 incidents that year. Hate crimes are “crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity,” according to the definition in a U.S. law, and can include violence against people or property.
Beyond violence, other types of discrimination or unequal treatment can exist. In countries where homosexuality is legal and there are legal protections against discrimination, some people who are homosexual or perceived to be homosexual report instances of discrimination or “harassment” at school, in the workplace, in housing opportunities, while in public or while receiving medical care.
In the U.K., for example, where same-sex marriage is legal and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is illegal, a recent national government survey found that more than a quarter of LGBT respondents experience verbal harassment for their sexuality over the past year. Additionally, 6 percent reported they were physically threatened, and 4 percent said they were physically or sexually assaulted.

42593,2018-09-13,Press freedom developments: An abridged timeline,"“People have a need to know. Journalists have a right to tell. Finding the facts can be difficult. Reporting the story can be dangerous. Freedom includes the right to be outrageous. Responsibility includes the duty to be fair. News is history in the making. Journalists provide the first draft of history.” Newseum, Washington, D.C.
Press freedom is not a static phenomenon. It has varied throughout the ages and in different parts of the world. Press freedoms are often weighed against other concerns and responsibilities, such as privacy concerns and protection of government secrets. This brief timeline highlights a few of the many developments related to press freedom and freedom of speech. This timeline is not meant to be comprehensive and has an emphasis on developments in the U.S.
399 BCE, Greece: In an early recorded freedom of speech argument, Greek philosopher Socrates tells his prosecutors: “If you offered to let me off this time on condition I am not any longer to speak my mind... I should say to you, ‘Men of Athens, I shall obey the Gods rather than you.’” 
1689, Britain: In the first known legal guarantees of freedom of speech, the British Bill of Rights grants speech freedoms to members of parliament (though not expressly to citizens in general).
1789, France: A century after the U.K.’s bill of rights, the first parliament of the French revolution, the National Constituent Assembly, wrote speech and press freedoms for all citizens into the The Declaration of the Rights of Man. “The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man,” the document stated. “Every citizen may therefore speak, write, and print freely.”
1791, U.S.: The First Amendment is added to the U.S. constitution, based in part on ideas from letters written in Britain in the 1720s and published under the pseudonym “Cato.” The First Amendment says, “Congress shall make no law …  abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”
1919, U.S.: In the case Schenck v. U.S., the Supreme Court affirms that restrictions on freedom of the press may be legitimate in cases where the information poses “clear and present danger,” such as military strategy that could put American lives at risk or other threats to public safety. 
1948, United Nations: The U.N. General Assembly adopts the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.”
1971, U.S.: The U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of The New York Times and The Washington Post, in the case New York Times Co. v. U.S., saying that the government could not place “prior restraint” (restraint before publishing) on the newspapers’ publishing top secret documents colloquially known as the Pentagon papers. (This is the subject of Steven Spielberg’s Oscar nominated The Post.)
1981, international: The Committee to Protect Journalists is formed, and works to advocate for journalistic rights and protections in “repressive” and dangerous areas. 
1993, U.S.: The largest award in a defamation (libel) case against a newspaper is awarded: more than $222 million. The Wall Street Journal is ordered to pay damages for a story about alleged corruption at a Texas securities firm. The verdict is later vacated in 1999 and the plaintiff drops the suit. (Journalists in the U.S. have a legal obligation to not knowingly publish false information that could damage a person or entity, regardless of the First Amendment.)  
2002, international: Reporters without Borders (RSF, for its French acronym) releases its first annual “World Press Freedom Index” report. 
2012, Myanmar: The Myanmar government removes a requirement for print publications to submit all of their content for government review before publication, a form of direct censorship; film content must still be submitted in advance. 
2013, U.S.: A federal court rules that journalists can be compelled to testify in criminal proceedings, “even though the reporter promised confidentiality to his source.” In 1972, a U.S. court had ruled that reporters could not be compelled to reveal anonymous sources. 
2016, Ivory Coast: The Ivory Coast become the most recent country (to date) to rewrite its constitution and include a guarantee of the “freedom of expression” for “everyone,” adding that the freedoms are “subject to respect for the law, for the rights of others, for national security and for public order,” and do not extend to “propaganda whose objective or outcome is to elevate one social group above another.”
2017, Germany: Germany passes a law, known as NetzDG, that can be used to fine social media platforms up to $58.5 million (€50 million) for not removing “obviously illegal” posts, such as speech that incites violence against certain groups. 
2018, Malaysia: Malaysia issues first conviction under its new “fake news” law, sentencing a Danish citizen to a week in jail for falsely stating the time it took police to respond to a traffic accident in a YouTube video.

42590,2018-09-13,‘Press freedom’ around the world,"Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit agency that tracks and advocates for freedom of the press, has published an annual “World Press Freedom Index” since 2002. 
According to the group, which goes by its French initials RSF, the index ranks 180 countries “according to the level of freedom available to journalists” and acts as “a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on an evaluation of pluralism, independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and safety of journalists in each country.” (RSF also notes that the index does not reflect or measure the quality of journalism.)
In journalism, the term “pluralism” can refer to the representation of varied opinions and ideologies, or to the diversity of media owners and independent editorial decision makers in a country overall, according to the Dutch-based Mediamonitor group. The latter is particularly relevant in countries where all or most of the media is state-owned and state-run. 
The countries with the most and least ‘press freedom’ 
According to the RSF’s 2018 World Press Freedom Index, the five countries with the most press freedom are (in order): Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland. Those with the least press freedom in 2018 are: North Korea, Eritrea, Turkmenistan, Syria, and China.  
On the list, the United States ranks 45th, Canada is 18th and the United Kingdom ranks 40th, to give a few more examples. Myanmar ranked 137 out of 180.
In order to determine where a country falls on the list, RSF gives each country a score from zero to 100, with zero representing the highest degree of freedom the press could have. At the top of the list, Norway received of 7.63, while North Korea earned 88.87. The U.S., by comparison, received 23.73, Canada had a 15.28, and Myanmar had 43.15. 
The RSF’s methodology for compiling the index includes sending questionnaires to journalists and media lawyers, as well as analyzing alleged abuses. 
Practices of limiting press freedoms
The RSF rankings can help people understand the state of press freedom around the world, but people might wonder what they actually mean, and how press freedom is limited or increased in practice. The following are several ways in which they can be limited, from more overt to more subtle. 
Killings and abductions
In some parts of the world, journalists (including those who write stories critical of the government or other groups in power) can be killed or can go missing. 
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a non-profit group that tracks threats to journalists, 26 journalists and media workers around the world have been confirmed as murdered so far in 2018. Since the CPJ began tracking this information in 1992, more than 1,300 journalists and media workers have been killed, including 847 confirmed murders. Another 60 journalists went missing during those years. 
Imprisonments
In some cases in which journalists are convicted of crimes and jailed, the judicial system is accused of trying to silence them through false charges. The CPJ reports that in 2017, there were 262 imprisoned journalists. The most were in Turkey, where the country limited certain press freedoms and closed more than 100 media outlets after a failed military coup attempt against Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government in 2016. (The government also fired tens of thousands of public workers, including judges and military officers.)
According to RSF figures, there were 157 journalists, 143 citizens journalists and 19 media assistants imprisoned in 2018 as of September.
Also this year, Malaysia jailed a YouTube commentator for a week in the country’s first conviction under a new “fake news” law. (He had misstated how long it took police to respond to an accident, which he said was a mistake.)

Limiting access
Censorship can take various forms and has changed with improvements to technology. For example, for decades the Mexican government held a monopoly on newsprint, the physical paper on which newspapers are printed. This gave the government a high level of control over which news outlets could purchase the paper. (President Carlos Salinas de Gortari’s government changed this in 1990, allowing publications to purchase newsprint from international sources.)
With newer technological advances, governments can block internet access so people cannot receive news from certain news outlets (local or international), or even limit access to the internet in general. China, for example, blocks access to certain websites with content critical of the government’s actions. Since 2017, Egypt has blocked hundred of websites, including news sites, for allegedly “allegedly “supporting terrorism.”
Cuba only this year began allowing limited internet access on mobile phones, and internet access is financially inaccesible to much of the population. (The government telecommunication company charges companies and embassies $45 a month for four gigabytes of data, and mobile hotspots cost $1 an hour; the average worker in Cuba earns $30 per month.)
Other forms of censorship
News outlets can also be closed or taken over in a variety of ways. In 2016, for instance, the Turkish government took over publication of news outlet Zaman, which had been publishing criticism of Erdoğan, and continued publishing prioritizing positive content without mentioning the change in leadership. 
In another example, the Cambodian government closed one newspaper after it alleged the company owed $6.3 million in back taxes and gave it 30 days to pay. The paper said the tax bill was false. 
In some cases, governments have revoked press credentials (which allow reporters access to certain events and documents), and critics have called this a form of censorship. Last year, for instance, Israel announced plans to close Al Jazeera’s offices and revoke press credentials from the company’s journalists. 
Leaders can also limit access of information to reporters from certain news outlets. Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, for example, told his press secretary not to allow any reporters from The Washington Post into the White House except for press briefings, after Post reporters wrote about Watergate. When U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not take questions from a CNN reporter, some accused him of press censorship. 
Is state-funded media a form of censorship?
Countries where all the press is state-owned and state-run can lack journalistic pluralism and this can limit people’s access to information — especially information that could reflect negatively on the government. However, state-funded media in itself is not necessarily restrictive. Mediamonitor reports that governments offering financial support such as grants, press funds, and reduced tax rates can actually increase pluralism in some cases. 
Additionally, some governments with state-funded media enact legal measures to limit the amount of influence the government has on editorial choices. For example, in Canada, the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC) is primarily funded by the government. Yet it operates independently from the government, and there are legal restrictions on a regulating government council firing the head of CBC.

42581,2018-09-13,Myanmar leader Suu Kyi says jailed journalists violated law,"Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said Thursday that two Reuters journalists who were jailed in the country were convicted because they violated Myanmar law, not because of their profession. 
“They were not jailed because they were journalists, they were jailed because ... the court has decided that they have broken the Official Secrets Act,” Suu Kyi said during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Hanoi, Vietnam. 
Suu Kyi called on critics of the verdict to review the case documents and point out anything they felt was a “miscarriage of justice.” She also noted that the defendants, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, had the right to appeal the judgement. “If we believe in the rule of law, they have every right to appeal the judgment and to point out why the judgment was wrong.”
Reuters responded to Suu Kyi’s comments, saying, “We continue to believe that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo did not violate Myanmar’s espionage law, and at no point in time were they engaged in activity to hurt their country.”
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said Suu Kyi “failed to understand that real ‘rule of law’ means respect for evidence presented in court, actions brought based on clearly defined and proportionate laws, and independence of the judiciary.”
The journalists, who deny the espionage allegations, had reported on the Myanmar military’s alleged killing of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.
On Sept. 4, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called on the Myanmar government to reverse its ruling and release the journalists. “Wa Lone

42272,2018-09-13,What people are saying about the EU vote on Hungary,"The European Union Parliament voted 448 to 197 (with 48 abstentions) to initiate a review of whether Hungary had violated EU law for allegedly restricting the media, denying refugees equal rights and other actions. The vote could eventually lead to penalties or sanctions on Hungary. Not everyone agreed about the vote. Here’s a look at what leaders are saying:
Hungary’s prime minister
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán alleged that the EU’s decision was a response to Hungary’s refusal to take in the number of refugees required by an EU-wide resettlement quota scheme. (Hungary has refused to take in refugees since the EU enacted temporary intake quotas in 2015.)
Regarding his country’s decision to not take in the refugees, Orbán said in a January interview, “We don't see these people as Muslim refugees. We see them as Muslim invaders,” adding that Germany had wanted the migrants, but Hungary didn’t. “We believe that a large number of Muslims inevitably leads to parallel societies, because Christian and Muslim societies will never unite.” He called multiculturalism “only an illusion.”
Hungary’s foreign affairs minister
“The decision of the European Parliament on the adoption of the [report on Hungary’s alleged EU violations] is the petty revenge of the pro-immigration politicians,” Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said. He said Hungary would be “reviewing the available opportunities for legal redress.”
Initiator of the vote
EU Parliament member Judith Sargentini of the Netherlands issued a report listing Hungary’s alleged violations, which led to the vote on Hungary.  
“Viktor Orban's government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash,” Sargentini alleged in a letter. “Individuals close to the government have been enriching themselves, their friends and family members at the expense of Hungarian and European taxpayers.”
“We stand up for the rights of all Europeans, including Hungarian citizens and we defend our European values,” Sargentini said of Wednesday’s vote. “Now it is up to the European leaders to take their responsibility and stop watching from the sidelines as the rule of law is destroyed in Hungary. This is unacceptable for a Union that is built on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights.”
President of the European Commission

The commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who is ineligible to vote with the Members of the European Parliament in accordance with EU rules, said via his spokesperson’s Twitter account, that he was “in harmony with today's decision.”
“The European Commission is using the tools we have, launching infringement procedures against countries that don't respect EU law,” his spokesperson tweeted.
Other criticism of Hungary
Amnesty International's expert on human rights in the EU, Berber Biala-Hettinga, said the EU vote “made it clear that human rights, the rule of law and democratic values are not up for negotiation.”
Other criticism of the EU’s action
Some politicians critical of the EU or centralized European government criticized the vote, such as British politician Nigel Farage, who led the campaign for the U.K. to leave the EU. 
“European Parliament votes to remove Hungary’s voting rights, the authoritarian grip of the EU gets even tighter,” Farage tweeted. 
Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, tweeted, “Hungary is the example for all EU countries and Orban is a hero and deserves the Nobel Prize.”

42267,2018-09-13,Q&A: Migration to the European Union,"What is the European migration ‘crisis’?
European Union countries have been experiencing higher numbers of migrants seeking asylum over the past few years — a trend often referred to as the “immigration crisis” or “migrant crisis.” More than 1.7 million such migrants have arrived in the EU since 2014, most of them fleeing the Syrian conflict, while others come from Africa, other parts of the Middle East and other areas.
Roughly 30 percent of migrants were children in 2015 and 2016, including those unaccompanied by an adult, according to the European Commission.
The European Commission reported that most migrants are trying to “escape from political oppression, war and poverty, as well as to reunite with family and benefit from entrepreneurship and education.” The latter group (those seeking entrepreneurship and education) is referred to “economic migrants.” This type of migrant is not eligible for asylum, according to the European Commission.
Asylum seekers are people fleeing conflict or persecution and seeking protections outlined in the 1951 Refugee Convention on the Status of Refugees, which was ratified by 145 United Nations member states. A refugee is an asylum seeker whose asylum claim has already been approved.
Where do the migrants arrive?
Most of the migrants enter the EU in Greece and Italy, followed by Spain. An EU law, the 2013 Dublin Regulation, stipulates that migrants seeking refugee status must apply for asylum in the country where they first enter Europe and remain in that country for the asylum process. Under the law, the countries of arrival are legally responsible for reviewing the asylum claims, and either granting the claim or determining that migrants need to return to their countries of origin.
Refugees who have been approved to live in the EU are sometimes relocated to member states other than their country of arrival. This decision is based in part on criteria established by the Dublin Regulation that determine when a country is receiving a disproportionate number of asylum applications based on its relative size and wealth.
How many asylum seekers are coming to the EU?
Migration to Europe reached its peak in 2015, with 1,015,078 migrants recorded as arriving in the EU to seek asylum this year, the majority of whom were smuggled from Turkey to Greece by sea. (These figures do not include migration from other EU member states or other types of legal migration.) 
The number of new migrants has declined since 2015. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 362,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 2016: 181,400 arrived in Italy and 173,450 in Greece.
Last year, the total figure of migrants newly entering Europe was about 105,000. (See below for measures the EU has taken to reduce migration.) 
According to the European Migration Network, a total 709,200 asylum applications were filed in the EU plus Norway in 2017. This was 43 percent fewer than the previous year.
From January to mid-September 2018, just over 76,000 migrants seeking asylum arrived in the EU, according to UNHCR figures.
There are also estimated to be hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in Europe.
What’s the problem?
While the European Union maintains that it has a “legal and moral obligation” to protect asylum seekers who have a legitimate claim for protection, the increased migration has placed an economic burden on EU countries.  Between 2015 and 2017, the EU allocated about $20.6 billion (€17.7 billion) of its budget to address migration, including funding for projects outside of the EU and humanitarian aid. (The EU’s total annual budget in 2015 was $170.8 billion, or €145 billion.)
Individual countries also spend large sums on the migrant situation, including on border improvement. For example, Germany spent about $26.7 billion (€23 billion) on migration in 2016, according to Johannes Singhammer, the vice president of the German parliament at the time.
A EU member state can choose not to accept a refugee who has been granted asylum and whom it would otherwise need to accept under the Dublin Regulation. The country can instead choose to reallocate the migrant to another EU state, but this will cost the country money. In accordance with the regulation, the country is obligated to contribute €250,000 for each such applicant.
Additionally, migrants go through dangerous and sometimes deadly situations to reach the EU. The European Commission reported that as much as 90 percent of migrants hired human smugglers. Thousands of migrants have died while trying to reach Europe by sea. In 2015, the year with the highest levels of migration, a recorded 3,771 migrants died or went missing while trying to reach Europe by sea, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Migrants who arrive and seek asylum are sometimes held in detention centers. Activist groups have accused some of these centers of violating the European Convention on Human Rights’ provisions that prohibit inhumane and degrading treatment.
What has the EU done to address the situation?
The EU has taken measures to try to address the migrant situation in multiple areas, within the union and outside of it.
In May 2015, EU leaders drafted “A European Agenda on Migration,” which outlined commitments for EU countries to take certain numbers of refugees. It also outlined other projects, such as stopping human smugglers, increasing border security, and “simplifying” the asylum process.
At sea, EU countries have increased the presence of ships in the Mediterranean to stop migrant trafficking networks and rescue migrants from drowning. Between 2015 and 2017, the EU caught 2,000 traffickers and 375 trafficking vessels, according to the European Commission. The EU has also deployed more border guards to the borders of member states.
The EU’s agenda on migration has also included a plan to give development assistance to countries from which many of the migrants originate. For example, the EU is providing funding for self-employment opportunities in Niger aimed at reducing economic hardship that encourages migration through the Sahara to Europe.
The EU, in 2015, also outlined temporary quotas for the number of refugees each member state must accept. Some member states, such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic refused to accept the quotas. Other states have not met their requirements. 
Have EU countries done anything else?
Individual member countries have also created laws and policies to address migration. For example, in 2002, Italy passed a law that made illegal immigration and helping migrants enter the country illegally punishable by fines or jail time.
Hungary passed an emergency measure in 2015 that had similar aims, then in 2018 passed a law that that made “facilitating illegal immigration,” punishable by a year in jail. Hungary has also termed asylum seekers “illegal immigrants,” and the law applies to them. The law, which affects non-governmental organization workers, also made the grounds for applying for asylum more restrictive. In 2015, 177,000 migrants sought asylum in Hungary, and the country accepted a few hundred of the applications.
The U.N.’s Declaration of Universal Human Rights states, in Article 14(1), “Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.”

42262,2018-09-13,What is the European Union?,"The European Union (EU) is a body that currently includes 28 countries, known as member states. When a country joins the EU, its representatives agree to divert some of their decision-making powers to EU institutions. In exchange, countries receive benefits, including access to free trade.
EU laws supercede laws of member states for areas in which the EU has jurisdiction, such as agriculture, fisheries and transport. The EU Commission can propose new laws that the Parliament and Council can decide to adopt. Then, member states and the EU Commission implement the new laws. EU citizens can also elect members of the Parliament, and qualifying member states can use the official EU currency, the “euro.” 
Brief EU history
The EU was created in 1951, after World War II, and was aimed at preventing neighboring countries from going to war. The EU began with an alliance among Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. 
The participating members established trade agreements and removed customs duties. By the 1960s, member states also agreed to have joint control over food production to reduce supply shortages among EU citizens.
Between 1973 and 2013, an additional 22 member states joined the union, with Croatia being the most recent country added. However, the U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU at 11 p.m. U.K. time on March 29, 2019, after voting in a referendum to exit the union in 2016. The U.K. would be the first country to leave the EU, though it could return at a later date if it still incorporated the union’s regulations and laws.
The Euro
The EU has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the 28 member countries. The group of countries that use it is known as the “euro zone.” Countries such as the U.K. and Denmark didn’t adopt the euro. The EU also has a single marketplace in which all members can exchange goods and services without paying tariffs. 
EU member states must meet certain economic and legal standards known as the Maastricht criteria to be a part of the “euro zone.” The Maastricht criteria includes rules on inflation, budget deficits limits, national debt, interest rates and exchange rates.
Citizens within the EU can move freely between member states.
EU Parliament
The EU Parliament has 751 MEPs, or Members of the European Parliament, elected directly by the citizens of EU member states every five years. The last election was held in 2014. 
MEPs elect a president for a renewable term of 2-1/2 years. The president represents EU Parliament internationally, oversees members’ work, and signs budgetary and legislative acts adopted by parliament.
The parliament has three primary functions: 1) passing EU laws and deciding on other international agreements and legislation; 2) supervising EU institutions such as banks, and reviewing petitions or inquiries posed by its citizens; and 3) managing the union’s budget. The parliament also includes at least 20 committees that focus on specific issues, such as human rights, international trade, and transportation.
MEPs are grouped by political affiliation, not by country. Parliament currently has MEPs representing nine political parties. With 218 MEPs, the European People’s Party (EPP) is the largest political group in parliament. According to parliamentary rules, no EU country can have fewer than six or more than 96 MEPs, and the total number cannot exceed 751, including the president.
Treaty on European Union
The Treaty on European Union, also called the Treaty of Maastricht, named for the Dutch city, forms the constitution of the EU and outlines principles of the union. Article 9, for example, says, “the Union shall observe the principle of the equality of its citizens, who shall receive equal attention from its institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.” 
Article 7 of the treaty was designed to prevent member states from enacting laws or policies that went against the democratic principles on which the EU was founded. The article allows parliament or the EU Commission to determine whether there is a “clear risk of a serious breach by a member state” of the values referred to in Article 2 of the treaty by questioning the member state and reviewing evidence against them. Article 2 values include: “human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.”
A member state and parliament can attempt to remedy any alleged breaches. If the member state is found to continue to not comply with EU values, it may have certain rights suspended, such as the ability to vote on EU laws in parliament.

42257,2018-09-13,EU Parliament votes to review whether Hungary violated law,"The European Union Parliament voted on Wednesday to initiate a review of whether Hungary had violated EU law through a number of actions, including allegedly limiting the media and denying refugees equal rights. The EU Parliament will also review whether any alleged actions by the member state warrants penalties or sanctions. Hungary denied the allegations.
The EU Parliament alleged that Hungary violated its Charter of Fundamental Rights, which include “respect for democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights.” The EU outlines the review process in Article 7 of its charter. 
In its announcement, the EU Parliament listed several “concerns” it had with the Hungarian government, including: the functions of its constitutional and electoral systems; whether its judiciary remains independent; corruption and conflicts of interest; privacy and data protection; freedom of expression, religion, and association; academic freedom; the right to equal treatment; minority rights; the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees; and economic and social rights.
Hungarian President János Áder signed a law on June 28 that made it illegal for human rights workers and community volunteers to provide certain services to migrants and asylum seekers. The punishment includes a jail sentence of up to one year. 
According to Reporters Without Borders, business associates of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have bought several media outlets with the intention of creating a so-called “pro-government media bubble” meant to promote the government’s positions on topics such as immigration.
According to the EU Parliament, this is the first time that it has called on EU members to potentially penalize a member state to “prevent a systemic threat to the union’s founding values.”
Orbán said the EU’s decision was a response to Hungary’s refusal to take in the number of refugees required by an EU-wide resettlement quota plan. Hungary has refused to take in refugees since the EU enacted temporary intake quotas in 2015.
Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said, “The decision of the European Parliament on the adoption of the [report on Hungary’s alleged EU violations] is the petty revenge of the pro-immigration politicians.” Szijjártó said Hungary would be “reviewing the available opportunities for legal redress.”
The EU Parliament voted 448 to 197, with 48 abstentions, to initiate Article 7 procedures against Hungary. To initiate Article 7, an “absolute majority” of members (376) must participate in the vote and two thirds of the votes cast, excluding the abstentions, must vote in favor of proceeding. 
The process to initiate Article 7 began when EU Parliament member Judith Sargentini from the Netherlands issued a report listing Hungary’s alleged violations, based on information provided by independent bodies such as Amnesty International, the Civil Liberties Union for Europe, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
“In the week that we debate the state of the Union, the European Parliament sends out an important message: We stand up for the rights of all Europeans, including Hungarian citizens and we defend our European values,” Sargentini said of Wednesday’s vote.
“Now it is up to the European leaders to take their responsibility and stop watching from the sidelines as the rule of law is destroyed in Hungary. This is unacceptable for a Union that is built on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights.”
The EU’s 28 individual member states will now vote on whether to approve the EU Parliament’s proposal to initiate Article 7. If approved by a four-fifths majority, the European Council may impose sanctions on Hungary or temporarily remove its EU voting rights.

42574,2018-09-14,What was the 2016 Trump Tower meeting?,"In June 2016, several members of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign met at Trump Tower in New York City with a Russian lawyer and others. 
Who was at the meeting?

The people in attendance were reportedly: 

	Donald Trump Jr., Trump’s eldest son
	Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and advisor
	Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager at the time
	Rob Goldstone, a British publicist who set up the meeting, according to emails
	Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer
	Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born American lobbyist
	Anatoli Samochornov, a Russian-born American translator
	An eighth person, a representative of the Agalarov family, may have also attended, CNN reported. (Aras Agalarov is a Russian developer, business owner, author and billionaire.) No one known to be present has publicly confirmed this. 

What happened at the meeting?
Some of the people who attended the meeting have given information on the record about what they say happened. 
A Goldstein informed Trump Jr. of someone who had opposition research on Hillary Clinton, and set up the meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower, according to photos of an email chain Trump Jr. released last July. 
According to statements later made by Trump Jr., Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin, they did not discuss the campaign and the Russian lawyer did not provide information about Clinton. Instead, Trump Jr. said Veselnitskaya talked about “the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act.” 
Veselnitskaya has campaigned against the Magnitsky Act, which the U.S. government passed in 2012 to withhold visas or freeze assets of Russian individuals who have been suspected of human rights violations. She also founded a group supporting the removal of a Russian law preventing U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children, which was put in place following the 2012 Magnitsky Act.
Akhmetshin, who works as a lobbyist for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, said he had been meeting with Veselnitskaya before the Trump Tower meeting and she asked him to join. 
The foundation, records show, registered in April 2016 to lobby Congress. The foundation lobbied against the Magnitsky Act, according to testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Akhmetshin and lobbyists he hired sought to meet on the issue with U.S. lawmakers, The Washington Post reported. Akhmetshin, as well as Veselnitskaya, attended a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on U.S. policy on Russia on June 14, 2016.
Akhmetshin was drafted and served in the Soviet Army for two years in the 1980s before moving to the U.S. in 1994. He said he has never worked for the Russian government or Russian military intelligence.
Trump Jr. said he did not inform his father about the meeting at the time. President Trump said he did not find out about the meeting until 2017, shortly before the New York Times published a story about it. 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether any members of the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia, has questioned some of those who were present at the meeting.
Timeline of events and disclosures
June 9, 2016: Manafort, Trump Jr., Kushner and Goldstone meet at Trump Tower in New York City with Veselnitskaya, Akhmetshin, and a translator. Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after Veselnitskaya promised damaging information about Clinton.

42570,2018-09-14,"Manafort pleads guilty, agrees to cooperate with prosecutors","Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, entered a guilty plea on Friday to financial crimes and agreed to “fully” cooperate with the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is investigating the Trump presidential campaign. 
“I plead guilty,” Manafort said before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman in Washington.
Manafort, 69, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to: launder money, commit tax fraud, lie to the DOJ, fail to register as a foreign agent and fail to file foreign accounts reports, as well as an obstruction of justice charge. The crimes relate to consulting and lobbying work Manafort did for Ukrainian politicians prior to joining Trump’s campaign. 
Manafort was previously found guilty on 8 counts of financial crimes in a Virginia court in August (and was acquitted on 10 counts), with a recommended sentence of between 7 and 10 years in prison. Manafort was scheduled to begin a separate trial in Washington, D.C., later this month. With the guilty plea, the Washington trial will no longer take place. 
Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told the judge the plea agreement was a “cooperation agreement,” and that Manafort had already given the government some information. Weissmann said the remaining charges against Manafort would be dropped at sentencing or at “the agreement of successful cooperation.”
The prosecutors’ office outlined in the plea agreement that it placed the estimated sentencing range for Manafort’s alleged crimes at 210 to 262 months in prison (about 17 to 21 years), plus a possible fine of $40,000 to $400,000. However, with Manafort’s “full cooperation,” the agreement says the prosecutors’ office will file a Section 5K1.1 motion to allow for less than the legal minimum sentence, and allow Manafort’s lawyers to argue for a lesser sentence, including only probation. The court will maintain the ultimate right to determine and impose the sentence.
The plea agreement also waives Manafort’s right to appeal. 
Manafort’s lawyer Kevin Downing said his client “wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life.” 
“He’s accepted responsibility,” Downing said. “This is for conduct that dates back many years and everybody should remember that.”
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, whether any members of Trump’s campaign improperly cooperated with Russia, and “related matters.” 
Manafort worked for the Trump campaign for about six months in 2016. During that time, he was in attendance at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with the president’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a Russia national and Russian-born Americans. The meeting was reportedly set up by an associate of Trump Jr. for Trump’s campaign to receive disparaging information about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. 
After Manafort’s guilty plea, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the Manafort case “had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign.”
“Once again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign,” Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement. “The reason: the president did nothing wrong.”

42598,2018-09-16,"US journalism: A look at rights, restrictions and limits","The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” 

The Constitution didn’t define the concept of a “free” press, which ultimately lead to courts and Congress establishing a definition through law and legal precedent. The judiciary, for instance, also later ruled that government institutions other than Congress, including local police departments, could not prohibit “free” press or speech. Nonetheless, the judiciary continues to review cases that test the boundaries of a free press and the possible limitations of that freedom.

Should press and speech be restricted?

The U.S. court system and Congress say: yes, press and speech freedoms should be restricted in certain ways. This, however, may depend on the court, the type of material the press wants to publish, and the people in power. 
What does the U.S. government say about free press and speech?

In general, the government restricts or attempts to restrict the press and citizens from disseminating information that it considers a threat to national security, though some courts have ruled that “security” can be a vague term. Below are some examples.
Espionage Act

The Espionage Act of 1917, which is still enforced, prohibited people from publishing information relating to national defense that may be used “to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation.” Violations may lead to a $10,000 fine and up to 20 years in prison. 

Former CIA analyst Edward Snowden was charged in 2013 with violating the Espionage Act for giving “classified communications” to the press.
Schenck v US
In Schenck v United States, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on March 3, 1919, that the freedom of speech could be restricted if the information represented a “clear and present danger” to society.

In his ruling, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said, “The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic…The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.”
New York Times Co. v US
In 1971, when The New York Times and The Washington Post printed illegally obtained classified documents about the country’s involvement in the Vietnam War, the Supreme Court ruled in the newspapers’ favor. The court said the press was meant to “serve the governed, not the governors,” and that “only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.”

Regarding “security” concerns for restricting the press, the court said, “The word ‘security’ is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.”
“The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed representative government provides no real security for our Republic,” the court continued. “The Framers of the First Amendment, fully aware of both the need to defend a new nation and the abuses of the English and Colonial governments, sought to give this new society strength and security by providing that freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly should not be abridged.”
Policy on the seizure of materials
During the Obama administration, then Attorney General Eric Holder issued a policy change saying the Department of Justice would prohibit the seizure of materials gathered by a journalist unless the journalist was “the focus of a criminal investigation for conduct not connected to ordinary newsgathering activities.” Prior to the policy change, the Justice Department could seize certain materials from journalists if the materials were part of an investigation. 
Policy changes such as Holder’s can be reversed by the next person to hold that position, and court precedent can be overturned if a case arises that requires the justices to reevaluate a past ruling.
Has the press go too far?
A Google search for “has the press gone too far” yields several blogs and personal reactions from people discussing cases in which they thought the press overreached, in a variety of ways. This issue isn’t new. 
Privacy concerns
A paper published in 1985 by sociologists Martin Bulmer and Jennifer Bell argued that some forms of journalism violate an individual’s right to privacy, such as publishing information about someone’s private sex life. Others have also noted that the media shouldn’t publicize a politician’s sex life. 
The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), a U.S.-based journalism organization, may agree with that notion; it suggests journalists “balance the public’s need for information against potential harm or discomfort,” adding, “pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness.” 
Objectivity and journalists’ safety
For stories covering police actions or government surveillance, balancing the potential for harm versus the story’s public interest may be harder for a journalist to judge. 
For example, journalists covering political protests have sometimes gotten involved in the action they’re covering. In 2014, Politico published an opinion piece saying that journalists covering demonstrations against police in Ferguson, Missouri, had stopped reporting from a place of objectivity, noting that it may have been impossible for them to do so because they could be “pushed, prodded or find themselves on the receiving end of a rubber bullet or tear-gas canister,” while covering the police’s altercations with protestors. 
National security versus public interest
When it comes to national security, the U.S. government has said that Snowden’s release of classified documents, and their eventual publication by various media outlets did “tremendous damage” to U.S. national security. A report issued by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee said Snowden’s information revealed eight “high-risk issues” that revealed U.S. defense capabilities, and their publication could put U.S. troops “at greater risk in any future conflict.” Snowden’s actions publicized the U.S. National Security Agency’s intelligence gathering activities, which included gathering metadata and phone calls of U.S. citizens. 
In a 2017 op-ed, British journalist Alan Rusbridger said the information Snowden had released did limited “damage” to national security and helped to make the public aware of the government’s surveillance operations. In 2016, Attorney General Eric Holder told presidential advisor David Axelrod, “We can certainly argue about the way in which Snowden did what he did, but I think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made.” 
SPJ suggests journalists “consider the long-term implications of the extended reach and permanence of publication.” Whether the press goes “too far” in reporting on information may depend on the article’s impact over time. 
What people have said about the press over the years
Freedom of the press is sometimes described as a fundamental requirement for a democratic society. For example, the second U.S. president, John Adams, said, “The liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedom in a state.”
Former President Thomas Jefferson is quoted to have said, “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”
Samuel Gompers, a leader of the U.S. labor party in the 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote about freedom of speech and the press. He wrote: “We do not need this right to please those entrusted with the authority of government. Free press and free speech were guaranteed that men might feel free to say things that displeased. Demand for reform coming from the people is generally distasteful to those entrenched in power and privilege. We must have the right to freely speak and print for the wrongs that need resistance and cause that needs assistance.”

Upon losing his election for governor of California, former President Richard Nixon said, “You won’t have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference. … I hope that the press … recognize that they have a right and a responsibility, if they’re against a candidate, give him the shaft, but also recognize if they give him the shaft, put one lonely reporter on the campaign who will report what the candidate says now and then.”
Zimbabwean journalist Geoffrey Nyarota said in 2002, “As journalists, we are sometimes guilty of not taking cognizance of the enormity of the challenges and the responsibilities that we carry on our shoulders.”
On this year’s World Press Freedom Day, held on May 3, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, “The United States values freedom of the press as a key component of democratic governance. By fostering a free press, citizens are more informed, active and engaged in political decision-making, and can better hold their governments accountable.”

42470,2018-09-18,Recent major disasters in the US,"Natural disasters can be quite costly in terms of both the loss of human life, and the economic costs of repairs and replacement of damaged property. Both sets of figures can be challenging to compare across disasters due to discrepancies in the methodology used to calculate the totals. 
Death tolls, for example, at times count only “direct” deaths and in other cases count “indirect” deaths, and these figures can be measured in various ways. Direct casualties refer to those killed immediately and directly from the event. Direct deaths could include drownings in floods and hurricanes, people crushed by debris, trapped in fire and suffocating, and other immediate deaths. The category of indirect deaths is broader and would include deaths resulting from prolonged power outages, inability to access care, and sufficient food, water or medical supplies. Indirect deaths could also include fatalities from medical conditions such as heart attacks triggered by the shock of the disaster. 
The estimated costs of damage also vary. For a single event, estimates by agencies and organizations can may vary by several billion dollars. 
Yet even with these limitations, it’s useful to compare major disasters in recent U.S. history. We’ve compiled a outline of the five most costly natural disasters on U.S. soil over the past two decades.* (Note that while in this time period, all the most costly disasters were hurricanes, other have caused damages in the billions, such as the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake or the 1988 drought in the midwestern U.S.)
2005: Hurricane Katrina
Hurricane Katrina mostly occurred in Louisiana and Mississippi, but also in Florida, Georgia and Alabama. New Orleans sustained the most damage. 
Estimated death toll: 1,833 direct and indirect deaths, according to estimates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.
Estimated damage: $161 billion, according NOAA estimates.
2017: Hurricane Maria
Hurricane Maria made landfall on the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in September 2017. It also affected the U.S. Virgin Islands and non-U.S. territories including the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and more. 
Estimated death toll: 2,975 direct and indirect deaths in Puerto Rico, according to the governor’s official death count. The count was initially lower and then was raised in August 2018 to reflect the findings in a government-funded independent study by George Washington University.
Estimated damage: $90 billion, according to NOAA estimates.
2017: Hurricane Harvey
Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas in August 2017. After being downgraded, it also passed over Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky. 
Estimated death toll: 68 direct deaths and about 35 indirect deaths (more than 100 total), according to a NOAA report.
Estimated damage: $125 billion, according to NOAA estimates. 
2012: Hurricane Sandy
Hurricane Sandy affected many U.S. states and countries, from Jamaica to Canada. In the U.S., the majority of the damage was in New York. 
Estimated death toll: 72 direct deaths in the U.S., as part of a total 147 direct deaths in all affected areas, according to NOAA. In the U.S. an additional 87 indirect deaths occurred, NOAA reported. 
Estimated damage: $71 billion in damage in the U.S., according to NOAA estimates. 
2017: Hurricane Irma
Hurricane Irma primarily affected Florida, but also Puerto Rico and other areas in the Caribbean, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. 
Estimated death toll: 47 direct deaths, including 10 in the U.S., according to NOAA, plus an additional 82 indirect deaths, 77 of which were in Florida. 
Estimated damage: $50 billion, according to NOAA estimates.

42485,2018-09-18,"Russia and Turkey announce demilitarized zone in Idlib, Syria","Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Monday announced an agreement to establish a demilitarized zone in Idlib province that would be monitored by both Turkish and Russian forces. Russia supports the Syrian government while Turkey has supported militant groups that oppose the Syrian government.
Under the agreement, Russia and Turkey would establish a nine to 12.5 mile (15 to 20 km) wide demilitarized zone in Idlib province by Oct. 15. Putin said “radical militants,” such as the Al Nusra Front, would be withdrawn from the area. The Al Nusra Front is a Syrian division of al-Qaida.
In recent weeks, the Syrian government has reportedly sent tens of thousands of armed troops to the area and deployed more than 2,000 armored vehicles, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The U.N. has said a “full-scale” military operation on Idlib could risk a “humanitarian catastrophe.”
Under the demilitarized zone agreement, by Oct. 10, heavy military equipment, such as tanks, multiple rocket launchers, cannons and mortars, belonging to all opposition groups would also be withdrawn from the region, according to Putin. The agreement also calls for the reopening of roads connecting the Aleppo-Latakia and Aleppo-Hama routes before the end of 2018.
“Russia and Turkey have reaffirmed their commitment to fight terrorism in Syria in all its forms and guises,” Putin said. “It is our common opinion that practical efforts to fulfill the planned steps will give an added boost to the political settlement process in Syria, step up work on the Geneva platform and contribute to the return of peace to Syrian soil.”
Putin also said the agreement was “generally supported” by Syrian leadership, and that Russia would soon hold additional consultations with President Bashar Assad’s Syrian government.
Erdoğan said the demilitarized zone was required to prevent a “large humanitarian crisis.” The U.N. has said a “full-scale” military operation on Idlib could risk a “humanitarian catastrophe” due to the area’s estimated population of about 3 million people. 
According to the U.N., many Syrian civilians have traveled to Idlib seeking refuge from other conflict zones in the country during Syria’s 7-1/2-year-old civil war. About 500,000 people have reportedly arrived in Idlib over the past six months.
Erdoğan said that the “opposition will continue to stay in the areas they are in,” adding, “in return, we will ensure that radical groups, which we will designate together with Russia, won't be active in the relevant area.” Last month, the U.N. said Idlib Province had about 10,000 Al Nusra or al-Qaida members that it labeled as “terrorists.” 
Erdoğan said the goal for Syria was “firstly to ensure a constitution is formed, then, democratic elections are held there and finally the Syrian people have their own actual democratic administration.” 
While Erdoğan and Putin did not provide a timeline for establishing a new Syrian constitution or holding democratic elections in the country, Erdoğan said they had agreed the accelerate their efforts to finalize the formation of a constitutional committee “as soon as possible.”

42467,2018-09-18,Natural disasters in the US: How the government responds,"Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and fires can all be deadly, destructive, and costly. In the United States, they also can qualify for federal assistance, if designated a major disaster by the U.S. president.
There are a number of federal, state and local agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, that respond to such natural disasters. This can include efforts to:

	Respond to the immediate effects of a disaster with steps to limit loss of life and property damage, including providing emergency shelter and food supplies.
	Help communities recover to normal or better conditions with short- and long-term projects, including restoring power and telecommunications, removing debris and repairing damaged properties.
	Mitigate the effects of future disasters by implementing flood control projects, building tornado safe rooms, improving building quality standards, and other efforts.
	Increase preparedness for disasters, through ongoing planning and training of responders, public awareness campaigns about how to respond in disaster situations, and implementation of warning systems.

Disaster relief poses many challenges, from finding sufficient funding to coordinating interagency communications and relief efforts. 
What does a major disaster or emergency designation do?  
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for providing federal aid to federal emergency or federal disaster areas. Other federal agencies also help with and contribute to disaster relief and mitigation.
For a state government to access the majority of federal funding that’s available for natural disaster relief, the event needs to be declared a national emergency or national major disaster by the president.
How does an event become a national disaster or emergency?
The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which was signed into law in 1988 and has since been amended, outlines the process for declaring a major disaster. The act says, “All requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State.” The District of Columbia as well as U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, also count as “states” under this law.
The general process for getting the president to declare a major disaster is as follows, according to the Congressional Research Services’ interpretations of the relevant laws:

	The event occurs.
	Local governments respond to the event, and if unable to sufficiently respond to it, they request assistance from the state.
	Local, state and federal agencies, as well as volunteer organizations, complete initial assessments about the cost of response and recovery.
	The state’s governor sends a request to the president for federal aid.
	FEMA reviews the requests and makes a recommendation to the president.
	The president either approves or denies the request. If the president declares a major disaster or emergency, FEMA disaster relief funding is allocated and distributed.

In cases in which a natural disaster is predicted to be especially destructive, the states can request an emergency declaration prior to the actual occurrence of the event, in according with the Stafford Act.
How costly are natural disasters?
Natural disasters can be quite costly in terms of both the loss of human life and the economic costs of repairs and replacement of damaged property.
The ability to compare human casualties across disasters can be limited due to discrepancies in the counting of direct and indirect casualties in the death tolls. Direct casualties refer to those killed as an immediate and direct result of the event. Some agencies only count direct deaths, such as from drowning or being crushed by debris. Some governments or other reports also include indirect deaths linked to the disaster.
In the case of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, one study ordered by the territory’s government also counted deaths attributed to extended periods of blackouts and people’s inability to access hospitals or medical supplies. Including indirect deaths, the study estimated that 2,975 people were killed in Puerto Rico as a result of the hurricane, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster in the U.S. in decades. In comparison, Hurricane Katrina, which primarily affected Louisiana and Mississippi in 2005, is estimated to have caused 1,833 direct and indirect deaths.
Financial estimates of natural disasters also vary depending on the methodology of data-collection. Based on estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Hurricane Katrina caused $161 billion worth of damage, making it the most expensive disaster in recent U.S. history. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas in 2017, was the second most destructive at an estimated $125 billion worth of damage, NOAA reported.  
How are repairs funded?
Damage to public property
FEMA: FEMA’s public assistance program, which is its largest in terms of funding, covers costs associated with redressing damage to public infrastructure, from removing debris on roads to repairing public buildings, according to the Congressional Research Service.
According to figures from the Government Accountability Office, FEMA spent $104.5 billion on its Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) obligations between 2005 and 2014, including repairs to public infrastructure as well as aid to private citizens. That’s an average of more than $10 billion per year. (More on FEMA’s funding below.)
Other federal agencies: Seventeen federal departments all contribute to disaster relief, such as the departments of defense, transportation, agriculture, interior, and housing and urban development.  These agencies spent an inflation-adjusted average of $25.5 billion a year on disaster assistance from 2005 to 2014, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent non-profit organization.
Local and state funding: In addition to requests for federal funds, local and state budgets can include disaster relief funding through various agencies and line-items. According to a Pew Charitable Trusts report, the data on state funds for disaster relief is limited, varies by state and isn’t comprehensively tracked by each state. Some of the state spending was also focused on mitigation and preventative measures.
Damage to private property
FEMA: People living in disaster-designated areas who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles or personal property can be eligible for grant money from FEMA. According to the agency, the grants can “help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses and medical, dental and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses.” To determine whether people qualify, FEMA inspectors inspect the damage, and some grants are available only for lower income individuals. (To make a claim, go to www.DisasterAssistance.gov.)
Private insurance: Private insurance for real estate and personal property can cover expenses related to repairing and replacing damaged property. For example, private insurance companies paid out an estimated $41.1 billion on 1.7 million unique claims related to Hurricane Katrina.
NGOs and private donations: Non-governmental agencies, such as charitable organizations, as well as private donors sometimes aid in disaster relief. The American Red Cross, for instance, led a relief effort after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. In the weeks that followed the 2005 hurricane, the organization set up 1,150 shelters that housed almost half a million people, deployed 177,600 relief workers, and spent $854 million in emergency assistance.
How is FEMA funded?
Congress funds FEMA in two main ways: standard funding and supplemental funding. For the former, Congress provides base funding for FEMA’s normal operations, which in fiscal year 2017 was $615 million. Congress also proactively provides FEMA funding for Major Declarations, which was $6.7 billion that year. This figure is based on disaster relief expenses over the past decade.
Congress may be asked to grant supplemental funding to FEMA for disasters. For example, in 2005, when Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma occurred, Congress provided an addition $43 billion to FEMA.
In October 2017, Congress passed a $36.5 billion dollar hurricane and wildfire relief bill, which directed $18.7 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster relief fund to address Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and more.
According to a Congressional Research Services (CRS) report, not all members of Congress agree on the efficacy of FEMA’s current method of funding. Some believe that the current method works well, CRS reported, while others argue that changes need to be made to either increase the amount of available funding or to change funding structures to reduce the need for supplemental payments from Congress. For example, some have suggested creating a larger contingency fund for FEMA to use at its discretion. Others have suggested Congress should make the requirements to declare a national disaster stricter.

42465,2018-09-18,NOAA Atlantic hurricane season predictions for 2018,"The Atlantic hurricane season for 2018 runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted the following:

	Nine to 13 named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes are named to reduce confusion when multiple storms happen simultaneously).
	Four to seven hurricanes (tropical storms with wind speeds greater than 73 mph, or 117 km/h).
	As many as two major hurricanes (Anything beyond a Category 2 hurricane is considered “major”).
	The “combined strength and duration” of hurricanes, measured by the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, is within 50 to 100 percent of the normal median average.

NOAA considers the number of storms and their severity for 2018 to be below-normal or near-normal when based on season averages from 1981 to 2010. The seasonal hurricane average includes 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes.
The 2018 season has experienced 10 named storms so far: Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gordon, Helene, Isaac and Joyce. The NOAA has not issued final reports, which include maximum sustained wind speeds, for the latter four storms.
The 2018 storms:

	Alberto was a sub-tropical storm, which has the characteristics of a hurricane but with a maximum sustained surface wind speed of at least 39 mph (63 km/h). Alberto traveled between Mexico and Cuba from May 25 to May 31, heading north toward the Gulf Coast before making landfall in Florida and Alabama.
	Beryl was a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). It lasted from July 5 to July 15, passing near the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia and Barbados.
	Hurricane Chris lasted from July 6 to July 12, and had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (169 km/h). It formed in the Atlantic ocean between Bermuda and the North Carolina coast, but did not make landfall.
	With maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h), Tropical Storm Debby also did not reach land. It lasted from Aug. 7 to Aug. 9 in the north Atlantic Ocean.
	Tropical Storm Ernesto lasted from Aug. 15 to Aug. 18 and traveled north over the Atlantic Ocean. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h). 
	Hurricane Florence formed off the coast of Africa on Aug. 31 and moved northwest toward the U.S. It made landfall off the coast of North Carolina on Sept. 14 and had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h).
	Tropical Storm Gordon formed off the coast of Florida and headed northwest over the Gulf Coast between Sept. 2 and Sept. 7. The storm made landfall in Mississippi on Sept 5. 
	Hurricane Helene formed off the coast of Africa and headed northwest over the Atlantic before turning northeast toward Ireland. Helene was downgraded to a tropical storm before making landfall. The NOAA tracked the storm from Sept. 7 to Sept. 16.
	NOAA tracked Hurricane Isaac from Sept. 7 to Sept. 15 as it traveled west near Puerto Rico over the Caribbean. 
	Tropical Storm Joyce began on Sept. 12 in the Atlantic Ocean. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression on Sept. 16. It has not made landfall.

According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ocean water needs to be about 79.7 degrees Fahrenheit (26.5° Celsius) with a depth of about 50 feet for the water to be warm enough for a hurricane to form. 
When warm, moist air on the ocean’s surface rises, it causes a low pressure area underneath. Air surrounding the high-pressure areas then “pushes” into the low-pressure area where the air becomes warm and moist, and rises again. According to the NOAA, the process is called a “tropical wave.”
As the air continues to warm and rise, the air around the low-pressure area begins to swirl. A combination of the warm ocean, water vapor and swirling air creates wind. The warm air eventually rises and cools to form clouds. Water condenses in the clouds, forming rain, and sometimes thunderstorms. 
When the wind speed reaches 74 miles per hour (119 km/h), the storm is classified as a hurricane. As the storm’s winds increase in speed, an “eye” forms in the center of the storm. The “eye” is a low-pressure system that sucks in higher-pressure air.
A hurricane loses its wind speed once it passes over land because it no longer has warm ocean water vapor to continue the “tropical wave” effect. 
Although a hurricane’s speed may slow over land, it can still cause damaging winds and rainfall.

42459,2018-09-18,At least 23 people killed from effects of Hurricane Florence,"The National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgraded Hurricane Florence to a tropical depression on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). Authorities attributed at least 23 deaths to the storm: six in South Carolina and 17 in North Carolina. About 575,000 homes and businesses remained without power as of Monday, according to the National Weather Service.
The NHC projected the storm would continue to move north-northeast toward the New England area. Portions of southern New York and southern New England may experience two to four inches of rain, with a maximum of six inches possible in isolated areas. 
Flash flood warnings remain in effect for parts of central North Carolina and southern Virginia. Flash flood watches are also in effect for most other areas of North Carolina, northern South Carolina, portions of Western Virginia, southern and eastern West Virginia, central and western Maryland, central and western Pennsylvania, southern New York and southern New England. 
The NHC also said Monday that tornadoes “remain possible” for northeast South Carolina, eastern and central North Carolina, parts of Virginia, western Maryland and southern Pennsylvania.
Evacuation orders remain in effect for about 7,500 people living within a mile of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, and parts of the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina. People living in and around areas near Black Creek and Bennettsville in South Carolina have also been ordered to evacuate.
Prior to the storm’s landfall, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for more than one million residents of coastal areas of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.
More effects from Florence 
North Carolina
Rising floodwaters caused a train derailment in Lilesville. Train officials said several rail cars derailed around 6 p.m. Sunday; some of the train’s personnel were taken to the hospital with minor injuries. According to local news outlet WCCB, the train was carrying hazardous materials; none of the rail cars spilled their contents.
Flooding on local roadways cut off the city of Wilmington from the rest of the state. Officials reportedly plan to airlift food and water to the city’s nearly 120,000 residents. 
Hundreds of roads in the state have closed due to flooding, including about 60 miles of Interstate 95. The Interstate runs about 1,917 miles (3,085 km) from Florida to Maine.
According to the National Weather Service, local authorities in the towns of Landis and Creston warned residents that levees in those areas could be breached. Residents downstream of the Creston area levee, Headwaters Dam, were told to evacuate. As of Monday, the levees had not been breached.
Gov. Roy Cooper said emergency crews have rescued 2,600 people and more than 300 animals throughout North Carolina. Florence caused record rainfall in parts of the state, including up to 33.9 inches (86 cm) in the town of Swansboro. The state’s previous record of 24.06 inches (61 cm) was set during Hurricane Floyd in 1999.
The National Weather Service said flood waters may become contaminated from local poultry and pig farms. According to the North Carolina Pork Council, an aerial survey conducted Sunday showed that flood waters had reached portions of its farms in at least three locations. The Council also noted that there had been no reported breaches of “treatment lagoons,” which house animal waste, and no reported instances of “lagoon contents spilling out.”
South Carolina
The South Carolina Emergency Management Division on Monday told residents to avoid contact with flood waters due to possible contamination from raw sewage and other hazardous substances.
On Sunday night, about two dozen people had to leave an evacuation center in the town of Cheraw after the building began to flood, local news station WCCB reported. The Cheraw Fire chief said the people were moved to Cheraw High School.
Marion County administrator Tim Harper said about 100 people had been rescued from rising waters in the towns of Marion and Mullins.
According to the South Carolina Department of Transportation, more than 100 roads in the state are closed due to flooding, downed power lines or fallen trees. Some bridges and roads have been washed out, the department said.
Rivers such as the Little Pee Dee, the Waccamaw, the Great Pee Dee, the Lumber and the Black may “reach or exceed flood levels” this week, the National Weather Service reported.

42562,2018-09-19,An overview of past North Korean nuclear agreements,"North Korea, South Korea and the U.S. are pursuing negotiations to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, but it’s not the first time. North Korea has previously entered into and, in the past, broken agreements to limit or end its nuclear program. Here is an overview:
1985: North Korea agrees to Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty
In 1985, North Korea signed the United Nations’ Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which is intended to “prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology.” The agreement, which called on signatories to pursue nuclear disarmament, allowed 18 months for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete an assessment of the North’s nuclear facilities and other inspections and safeguards. North Korea did not complete the IAEA assessment.

In 1993, the North announced plans to withdraw from the NPT, but the decision was suspended after discussions with the U.S. Then in 2003, North Korea formally withdrew from the NPT.
1992: Agreement between North and South Korea
In January 1992, North and South Korea signed the South-North Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The countries agreed not to “test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons” or to “possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities.” 
The agreement included a stipulation for verification through mutual inspections, and the countries established a joint nuclear commission as a mechanism for implementing the agreement. However, negotiations were unsuccessful in reaching an agreement on reciprocal inspections. While the joint declaration was still technically in force, the commission became inactive in 1993.
In 2002, North Korea said it had been secretly running a uranium enrichment program, which South Korea, Japan and the U.S. said violated the South-North Joint Declaration. 
1992: The Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA
In April 1992, North Korea signed the Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, set up by the NPT. The following year, initial IAEA inspectors alleged North Korea’s reporting showed discrepancies, and the North stopped allowing the IAEA to inspect its nuclear facilities. 
1994: The U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework
In 1994, the U.S. proposed a new agreement with North Korea, as part of an effort to keep North Korea in the NPT. The countries signed the US-DPRK Agreed Framework, named after the North’s formal name (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea). Under the agreement, in exchange for U.S.-organized aid and fuel shipments, North Korea committed to stopping its plutonium weapons program, as well as to remaining in the NPT and allowing IAEA inspections. In the agreement, the North also sought “formal assurances” that the U.S. would not use nuclear weapons against it.  

In 1998, North Korea violated the agreement’s provisions with a missile test. The U.S. conducted a policy review and recommended additional agreements. A new U.S. administration took office in 2001, before the recommendation was implemented.
In October 2001, the U.S. reported that the North violated the agreement by secretly enriching uranium; North Korea denied this. The U.S. then suspended the fuel shipments to the North. The U.S. also failed to complete conditions of the agreement, such as announcing in 2003 that it would stop a project to build light-water reactors, which are used in generating nuclear energy. The conditions of the agreement were never fully realized.
2002: North Korea-Japan Pyongyang Declaration
North Korea agreed to suspend missile testing in 2003 and afterwards as part of the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration. Both North Korea and Japan also agreed to adhere to international agreements on nuclear development. The agreement is violated with the North’s withdrawal from the NPT and subsequent missile tests.
2003 to 2007: The Six-Party Talks
Between 2003 and 2007, China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. held a series of negotiations on denuclearizing the North. The first, second and third talks resulted in various statements, but did not result in any joint agreements among all parties. During the negotiations, North Korea said it would accept a “freeze for compensation” agreement. 
Then in February 2005, North Korea said it possessed nuclear weapons and would not attend future talks, citing the U.S. Secretary of State’s comment that North Korea was an “outpost of tyranny.” After the U.S. changed its lead negotiator, North Korea joined the U.S. for a fourth round of talks later that year. The parties released a Joint Statement of the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks that affirmed the North’s commitment to end all nuclear weapons development and to return to the NPT, abiding by IAEA safeguards, in exchange for aid, investment and powerelectricity. A further round of talks in 2007 outlined specific plans and dates for the implementation of the 2005 agreement. 
However, in 2009 North Korea launched a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, and the U.N. condemned the actions. The North announced it would “not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks.”
2012: The Leap Day Deal
The U.S. and North Korea engaged in secret in 2011. Its leader Kim Jong-il died in December 2011 and was replaced by his son Kim Jong-un, who initially agreed to terms agreed to during his father’s leadership. On February 29, 2012, North Korea agreed to the Leap Day Deal, under which it committed to stop long-range missile and nuclear activities in exchange for food aid.
Yet in April, North Korea launched an “earth observation satellite” in violation of a U.N. resolution, and the U.S. suspended commitments under the Leap Day Deal. Then in May, the North amended its constitution and referred to itself as a “nuclear-armed state.”
2018: Panmunjom Declaration
In April 2018, North and South Korea committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and promised to formally end the Korean War, issuing the “Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula.” The document “confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.” The countries agreed to meet again to continue discussions. 
In July, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met with U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit, and they released a joint statement. It included that the North “reaffirmed” its commitment to the Panmunjom Declaration and the “firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” 
In September, after a meeting with South Korea, North Korea agreed to permanently shut down an engine test site and missile launch pad in Dongchang-ri and to permanently dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear facility “contingent upon corresponding measures” by the U.S., without stating what the measures needed to be.

42559,2018-09-19,A timeline of North Korea’s missile development,"Given the ongoing news of North Korea’s plans to dismantle its nuclear facilities and to stop testing missiles, information about the country’s nuclear and missile capabilities may be useful. We’ve compiled a timeline of the North’s missile and nuclear-weapon development from 1981 to 2018.
1981: North Korea and Egypt agree to a ballistic missile development deal. Egypt transfers Russian-built “Scud-B” missiles and “MAZ 543 transporter-erector-launchers (TEL)” to North Korea.
1983: Iranian Prime Minister Ruhollah Musavi and Defense Minister Colonel Mohammad Salimi arrange to finance North Korea’s “Scud-B” development program in exchange for the ability to purchase production models.

1984: North Korea successfully tests its first “Scud-B” missile.
1985: North Korea signs the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The treaty is intended to “prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology,” according to the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs.

1987: Scud-B production facilities capable of producing 50 missiles annually are established near Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Later, South Korean Defense Minister Yi Ki-paek claims North Korea conducted a long-range guided missile (Scud-C prototype) test north of the city of Wonsan in Hamgyong-Namdo.
1988: North Korea upgrades the Scud-B program to a Scud-C program, increasing the missile’s range to about 373 miles (600 km). The same year, North Korea signs the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of “asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of bacteriological methods of warfare.”
1989: North Korea starts to develop the Rodong, also called “Nodong,” intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM).
1990: North Korea successfully launches a Scud-C missile over the Sea of Japan. A U.S. intelligence satellite also photographs the launch of a new IRBM (Rodong-1), with an estimated range of 620 miles (about 1000 km).
1991: North and South Korea are admitted into the U.N. General Assembly. North Korea produces between four and eight Scud-C missiles per month, purportedly for resale rather than security. The country reportedly completes its prototype of the Rodong-1. South Korea’s Ministry of Defense reports that North Korea has produced at least 1,000 tons of chemical warheads for its missiles, in violation of the Geneva Convention.
1992: U.S. CIA Director Robert Gates announces that North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs “are our most urgent national security threat in East Asia.” He says, “North Korea has invested heavily in the military and depends on arms sales for much of its hard currency earnings.”
1993: North Korea successfully launches four missiles from Taepodong in Hwadae-gun. U.S. and Japanese intelligence officials suspect two of the missiles to be Rodong-1 missiles. They were reportedly fired at target buoys in the Sea of Japan. One missile traveled 311 miles (500 km) and another traveled about 62 miles (100 km); the other two reportedly did not surpass 62 miles.
1994: In January, South Korean news outlet Hanguk Ilbo reports that North Korea has 12 to 18 Rodong-1 missiles and is developing the Rodong-2. 
In February, U.S. intelligence satellites detect a new missile hardware mock-up at Pyongyang, which the U.S. designates as “Taepodong-2.” According to the intelligence report, the dimensions of Taepodong-2 suggest that it could travel up to 2,175 miles (3,500 km). 
In March, U.S. officials report that North Korea is building two new medium-range missiles: Taepodong-1 (1,000+ mile range, or 1609+ km) and Taepodong-2 (2,000+ mile range, or 3,218+ km).
1995: CIA Director James Woolsey tells the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the technology is “moving from an era of Scuds of single-stage missiles into an area of Taepodong-1 and -2s with ranges in the few thousands of kilometers — not quite intercontinental yet, but the path is clear.”
1998: North Korea conducts the first flight test of its two-stage Taepodong-1 IRBM. The first stage of the missile separated, or fell off, about 186 miles (300 km) east of the launch site, decreasing the mass of the remainder of it. The second stage continued over the Island of Honshu and landed in the Pacific Ocean 205 miles (330 km) east of the Japanese port city of Hachinohe, after flying about 857.5 miles (1,380 km). North Korea says the launch was an attempt to place a satellite in orbit. Japan calls the launch a “very dangerous act… [that] will have a serious impact on the security of northeast Asia.” The U.S. says it’s “concerned” about the launch.
1999: U.S. intelligence reports say that North Korea conducted propulsion tests for the Taepodong-2 missile in April or May. The reports say that North Korea refurbished its missile launch pad and is transporting rocket fuel to storage centers.
2003: North Korea withdraws from the NPT and starts acquiring “weapons-grade plutonium” from spent fuel rods.
2005: North Korea announces that it possesses nuclear weapons.
2006: North Korea test fires Taepodong-2, Rodong and Scud missiles. The Taepodong-2 can now travel about 9,320 miles (15,000 km). Later that year, North Korea reportedly conducts a successful nuclear test.
2009: North Korea says it carried out a second nuclear test, as well as additional missile tests.
2012: North Korea launches an Unha-3 rocket that puts its first satellite into space.
2013: North Korea says it conducted a third nuclear test.
2015: North Korea says it tested a submarine-launched missile and has developed technology to mount nuclear warheads on missiles.
2016: North Korea claims it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Later in the year, the country says it conducted a fifth nuclear test and several ballistic missile tests.
2017: Throughout the year, North Korea launches several missiles and announces that it conducted a sixth nuclear test. 
In May, North Korea fires an “intermediate-range Pukguksong-2 ballistic missile” into the sea, as well as the Hwasong-12. 
In July, Pyongyang says it carried out its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Hwasong-14. 
In August, North Korea flies a missile over Japan for the first time since 2009. 
In September, North Korea reportedly launches its sixth nuclear test: a hydrogen bomb estimated to have an explosive yield of 120 kilotons. North Korea also launches ICBMs in September and November.
2018: North Korea meets with South Korea and U.S. leaders to discuss denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In March, North Korea agrees to halt its testing of both nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. 
In June, U.S. President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time; Trump later declares on Twitter that North Korea is “no longer a nuclear threat.” A month later, The Washington Post reports that U.S. spy agencies have seen signs that North Korea is constructing new ICBMs. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also tells the U.S. Senate that North Korean factories “continue to produce fissile material” used in making nuclear weapons. 
In a meeting with South Korean leaders in September, Kim reportedly agrees to permanently dismantle at least one nuclear test site and shut down at least one missile launch site, contingent on unspecified measures taken by the U.S.

42553,2018-09-19,What is the Non-Proliferation Treaty?,"The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was implemented by the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs in 1970. Its primary goals are to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to encourage nuclear disarmament, and to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
A total of 191 of the world’s 195 countries have joined the NPT, including five countries that currently have nuclear-weapon arsenals. The nuclear-armed countries in the treaty are China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S., according to the Arms Control Association (ACA), a U.S.-based nonpartisan organization. Additionally, four countries that are not party to the treaty have nuclead weapons: India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea, the ACA reported, based on information from the U.S. State Department and other sources.
The NPT is one of several disarmament treaties maintained by the U.N. The organization also has treaties banning nuclear testing, chemical weapons and other types of weapons.
What does the NPT say?
The NPT includes several directives with which its signatories are expected to comply. The U.N. works with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which inspects nuclear test facilities or weapons sites, to ensure that all participating countries are complying with the treaty. Below is a summary of the NPT’s text.
Article 1: Any nuclear-weapon state participating in the treaty cannot transfer nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices to another recipient, or encourage any non-nuclear-weapon state to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.
Article 2: Any non-nuclear-weapon state participating in the treaty cannot accept any transfer of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosives, and cannot manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.
Article 3: Non-nuclear-weapon state participants must agree to allow the IAEA to inspect facilities to ensure compliance with the NPT, and each participant must abide by safeguards established by the IAEA when handling fissionable material, or material that is capable of undergoing nuclear fission.
Article 4: State participants can still use and develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. States with peaceful nuclear technology can work with other participants, including those without nuclear power, to further develop peaceful nuclear technology.
Article 5: State participants must ensure that any potential benefits from any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions would be made available to non-nuclear-weapon states participating in the NPT on a non-discriminatory basis.
Article 6: State participants must agree to cease the nuclear arms race and to nuclear disarmament.
Article 7: Any group of states can formulate and agree to their own regional treaties on nuclear weapons in their respective territories.
Article 8: State participants can propose amendments to the NPT that could then be voted on by all NPT signatories.
Article 9: Any state can sign on to the treaty.
Article 10: Any state can withdraw from the treaty if “extraordinary events” related
to the treaty’s subject matter have “jeopardized the supreme interests of its country.” The country must give the U.N. three months notice and detail the “extraordinary events” the country faces before leaving the NPT.
Article 11: Copies of the treaty would be made available in English, Russian, French, Spanish and Chinese.
What happens when a state violates the NPT?
Each year, the U.N. issues a “disarmament yearbook” detailing topics such as complaints from state participants regarding alleged treaty violations, nuclear weapon stockpile reductions, disarmament milestones and the status of disarmament, or lack thereof, in other parts of the world. 
Although the treaty’s text does not specify actions the U.N. may take toward a state for violating the treaty, it has issued sanctions on countries such as North Korea for treaty violations. North Korea had signed on to the NPT in 1985 but formally withdrew in 2003. In the 2017 disarmament yearbook, the U.N. called on North Korea to reenter the NPT.

42534,2018-09-19,AG Sessions announces new judicial limits on immigration cases,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Tuesday that immigration judges cannot use their discretion to dismiss deportation cases, and can only terminate cases using reasons based on established law. Sessions has the authority to direct the way immigration judges decide cases because U.S. immigration courts are controlled by the Department of Justice and are separate from the federal judiciary system. 
Current U.S. law allows an immigration judge to terminate a deportation case and to allow an immigrant to apply for naturalization or residence in the U.S. if the immigrant can prove that the reason for seeking residence in the U.S. involves “exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors.” In those cases, the judge may dismiss the termination hearing and order a hearing on an immigrant’s petition for naturalization. 
Tuesday’s announcement was part of a opinion that Sessions rewrote for an immigration case labeled “Matter of S-O-G-

42525,2018-09-19,Ireland officially repeals constitutional ban on abortion,"Ireland official repealed its constitutional ban on abortion on Tuesday, following a national referendum on the issue last May. President Michael Higgins signed the bill repealing the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment, which had acknowledged “the right to life of the unborn” as equal to a mother’s life. The Irish parliament has not yet passed new laws regulating abortion, so current laws prohibiting abortion remain in effect. 
Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar said legislation that would permit abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy would be introduced to the parliament in the first week of October. He and health minister Simon Harris said abortion services would be available in the new year. Harris also said doctors could refer patients for abortion services out of the country in the interim. 
The proposed legislation would include a three-day waiting period for abortions, Harris said. A health committee that spoke to the parliament had advised against imposing a waiting period, which had been proposed for cases where an abortion is medically necessary. 
Harris also said that abortion services would be free under proposed legislation, noting that he did not want cost to be a “barrier” and did not want private clinics to develop. 
The referendum
On May 29, Ireland voted to overturn its constitutional prohibition on abortion in a national referendum, with 64.1 percent of voters supporting the repeal. Approximately 2.15 million people voted in the referendum. The result was upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this month. 
The previous referendum on the issue was 35 years ago. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who publicly supported the repeal, called the referendum a “once-in-a-generation decision.”
Abortion law background
After a referendum in 1983, Ireland changed its constitution to grant an “unborn” the same right to life as a mother. Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution says, “The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.”

A high court ruled in 1986 that providing women with information about getting abortions outside of Ireland was unconstitutional, breaching the fetus’ equal right to life. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this decision in 1988.

In 1992, Ireland’s Supreme Court ruled that a person should be permitted to travel outside the country to receive an abortion in cases where the pregnancy presents a “real and substantial risk” to a mother’s life, though this doesn’t apply with non-fatal health issues. The ruling overturned a High Court decision that restricted the freedom of movement of a 14-year-old girl who had been raped by a neighbor and attempted to travel to Britain to have an abortion. She was deemed a suicide risk. The attorney general at the time sought the injunction against the girl’s travel.

In 1995, Ireland passed the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act, which outlined conditions under which information could be distributed to individuals or groups about abortion services that are available outside of Ireland. The Act did not require medical professionals to distribute information on foreign abortion services.

In 2013, the country passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act (PLDPA), which allowed abortion in cases in which at least two doctors consider there to be a “real and substantial risk of loss of the woman’s life from a physical illness” or “suicide” and in which that “risk can only be averted” by terminating the pregnancy.

The act was passed after the 2012 death of a 31-year-old woman, Savita Halappanavar, whose doctors declined to give her an abortion. Halappanavar, an Indian woman in Ireland, went to the hospital 17-weeks pregnant. Her doctors determined a miscarriage was “inevitable,” yet did not terminate the pregnancy. She died a few days later due to sepsis, a blood infection, and her husband claimed she may have lived if an abortion had been performed.

Catholic population
About 78.3 percent of the approximately 4.75 million Irish citizens self-identified as Roman Catholic, according to a 2016 Census. That represents a decline of 5.9 percent since 2011, and a total decline of 13.3 percent in the past 25 years, according to census results.
Pope Francis visited Ireland in August, the first time a pope visited there since 1979. In 2015, Pope Francis announced that all Catholic priests would be able to forgive the “sin of abortion” during the jubilee year, also known as the Holy Year or the Year of Mercy, from December 2015 to November 2016.
In the Catholic Church, the “sin of abortion” is punishable by excommunication and in most countries the punishment can only be overturned by a bishop. In some countries, including Britain, Canada, Scotland and the U.S., bishops have delegated authority to priests to absolve the sin.
The Catholic Catechism states that “human life is sacred” and “must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception.”
Irish referendums on other social issues

Ireland has previously decided the legality of other social issues by referendum. In 1995, Ireland voted 50.3 to 49.8 percent in favor of legalizing divorce. At the time it was the only European nation where divorce was illegal.

In 2015, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage, after a 62 to 38 percent vote in a referendum.

42510,2018-09-19,US to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports,"On Tuesday, the U.S. released a finalized list of approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that would be subject to additional tariffs, scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 24. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said the initial tariffs would start at 10 percent and increase to 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019. 
The tariff proposal was previously announced by President Donald Trump at a White House briefing on Monday.
The goods subject to the tariffs include pork products, seafood, produce, audio equipment, bicycle products and various types of furniture, according to the USTR list. Certain products are exempted from the tariffs, including: consumer electronics products, such as smart watches and Bluetooth devices; some chemical products for manufactured goods; and some health and safety products, such as bicycle helmets and child car seats.
The tariffs were in response to an investigation by the USTR published earlier this year that said, “the acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.”
The USTR said China has been “unwilling to change its policies involving the unfair acquisition of U.S. technology and intellectual property.” According to the USTR, rather than change its policies, China responded to U.S. tariffs “by taking further steps to harm U.S. workers and businesses.” In July and August of this year, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports.
On Tuesday, China responded to the U.S. tariffs by imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports, which would also take effect on Sept. 24. The tariffs would range from five to 10 percent. China’s announcement did not include a list of goods that would receive tariffs. A previous list of tariffed goods from China had included products such as coffee, honey and industrial chemicals, Deutsche Welle reported. 
“To protect its legitimate rights and interests and order in international free trade, China is left with no choice but to retaliate simultaneously,” China's Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday.
During Monday’s tariff announcement, and prior to China’s response, Trump had said that if China took “retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries,” the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports. He did not provide a date for their implementation.
Trump tweeted Monday, “Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position, with billions of dollars, and jobs, flowing into our country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable. If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be ‘Tariffed!’”
The Associated Press reported in a fact check on Trump’s tweet that the impact of the tariffs on employment is unknown given that the U.S. economy had been adding jobs prior to the tariff increases. The Treasury Department reported that it had a $5.4 billion increase in customs and duties collection so far this fiscal year, AP reported. AP attributed some of the increase to more goods being imported to the U.S.. Customs and duties account for about 1.2 percent of overall federal revenues, according to AP. 
The Institute of Supply Management (ISM), a not-for-profit association, recently issued a survey of manufacturing companies. ISM chair Timothy Fiore said survey respondents were “overwhelmingly concerned about tariff-related activity, including how reciprocal tariffs will impact company revenue and current manufacturing locations. Panelists are actively evaluating how to respond to these business changes, given the uncertainty.”

42500,2018-09-19,Major Syrian War developments in 2018,"The war in Syria has affected millions of civilians since the conflict began in 2011. More than 400,000 civilians and fighters have been killed, according to World Bank estimates. 
More than 5.6 million people have left the country to seek refuge elsewhere, and more than 6.6 million have been internally displaced (i.e. they moved to avoid the fighting but stayed within Syria), according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). Additionally, 13 million people in the country require humanitarian aid, including 6 million children, according to the U.N. 
Fighting began in March 2011, after government forces fired on “Arab Spring” protestors in the Syrian city of Daraa, killing four people. Protests were held in several cities in Syria, and security forces started to arrest protestors and respond violently. The fighting evolved into a civil war. 
The war is complex, with multiple military and paramilitary groups fighting: Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government is fighting various groups opposed to his government, and there are other groups fighting both the government and rebel forces. (For more, read our context “Syrian War fighters and backers explained.”) Seven-and-a-half years into the war, fighting continues in some areas and there have been many developments.
Below is an abridged list of major developments in the war so far in 2018 (see map below to reference locations):
Jan. 5: Russian airstrikes reportedly kill 25 civilians in eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held area in Rif Dimashq province. Eastern Ghouta is located just east of Damascus and encompasses the town of Douma.
Jan. 20: Turkish government forces enter Syria to fight the YPG, an armed Syrian-based Kurdish group, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announces. The YPG has controlled the city of Afrin and surrounding areas in the Aleppo province since 2012. Turkey considers the YPG to be a “terrorist” group. 
Feb. 1: An alleged chemical attack occurs in eastern Ghouta. The incident is the third suspected chemical attack by Assad’s forces in 2018, according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 
Feb. 4: Another suspected government chemical attack is carried out in the town of Saraqib in Idlib province, USAID reports. 
Feb. 4-9: Syrian-led airstrikes on eastern Ghouta reportedly kill at least 230 civilians, according to the U.N. On Feb. 10, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein calls for international response. 
Feb. 18: Assad’s forces begin a new, intensified offensive in eastern Ghouta, referred to as the Rif Dimashq offensive. Hundreds of civilians are reportedly killed in the period that follows.
Feb 22: YPG forces (and their all-female counterparts YPJ) leave northern Aleppo areas to defend Afrin; Syrian government forces take over neighborhoods in northern Aleppo.
Feb. 24: The U.N. Security Council unanimously passes a resolution for a 30-day ceasefire to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions of people.
March 15: The war enters its eighth year. Also, in the largest single-day displacement, an estimated 42,000 civilians leave eastern Ghouta. 
March 29: U.S. President Donald Trump says that the U.S. would leave Syria “very soon,” without giving a timetable. 
April 4: A peace summit with the presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia is held in the Turkish capital of Ankara. The next round of talks is scheduled for May 14. 
April 7: An alleged chemical weapons attack kills at least 41 civilians in the town of Douma, 12 miles (20 km) from the capital city of Damascus. The U.S., EU, Turkey, rebel groups and others attribute the attack to Assad’s government. Assad denies responsibility, and Russia says the evidence was “fabricated.” (Assad later invites international inspectors to investigate, and then denies access.)
April 13: U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks to the Security Council, saying, “there is no military solution to the conflict.”
April 14: The U.S., U.K. and France launch “precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapon capabilities” of Assad’s government, U.S. President Donald Trump announces. (The U.S. previously launched 59 missiles on Syrian targets in 2017 after an alleged chemical attack by Assad’s forces.) 
Also April 14: Syria declares it has removed the remaining militants from eastern Ghouta. “All the terrorists have left Douma city, their last bastion in eastern Ghouta,” the Syrian statement said.
May 16: Syrian government forces announce they have retaken 4,600 square miles (12,000 sq km) of territory from rebels in areas near southern Homs and northern Hama. 
May 21: Syria announces it has removed the remaining Islamic State (IS) fighters from south Damascus; for the first time in seven years, no more military operations are taking place in the capital. 
July 12: U.S. says it “may have” launched airstrikes that killed at least 54 civilians in Deir ez-Zor province. The strikes reportedly were intended to hit IS targets. 
Aug. 30: Russian airstrikes in Idlib province reportedly kill four people. The Syrian government has reportedly sent tens of thousands of armed troops and deployed more than 2,000 armored vehicles to the area in recent weeks, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The U.N. has said a “full-scale” military operation on Idlib could risk a “humanitarian catastrophe.”
Aug 31: Militant groups in Syria blow up two bridges that link areas they control to government-held territories in the northwestern al-Ghab plains area, near Hama. The SOHR reports that this is a response to increased Syrian military presence in Idlib.  
Sept. 4: The U.N. Special Envoy for Syria offers to escort residents of Idlib province to safety before the Syrian government launches an attack on militant groups controlling the region. The U.N.’s Staffan de Mistura says the northwestern province has about 10,000 members of al-Nusra, an al-Qaida-linked group, which the U.N. has labeled as “terrorists.”
Sept. 17: Russia’s and Turkey’s presidents announce an agreement to establish a demilitarized zone in Idlib Province that would be monitored by both Turkish and Russian forces.

42496,2018-09-19,"Ceasefires, demilitarized zones and de-escalation areas","During the course of wars and conflicts, parties can draft and enforce a variety of agreements aimed at reducing or ending the fighting. The terms can be confusing, so here’s an overview.
Ceasefire
A ceasefire agreement, sometimes called a truce or an armistice, is an agreement to do just that — cease firing, or end fighting. Ceasefires can be part of formal treaties or less formal spoken agreements between various sides of a conflict.
Some ceasefire agreements are designed to be temporary respite in fighting with an expiration date already established. (For example, earlier this year, the Afghanistan government announced a two-week ceasefire on fighting with the Taliban for the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr.) Other ceasefires are designed to be longer-term and maintain peace until a formal peace treaty can be established.
Ceasefire agreements can be complex and pose many challenges in implementation and enforcement. A report published by the United Nations Peacemaker department outlines considerations and challenges to drafting lasting ceasefire agreements, including the need to:

	Specify when hostilities must stop and for what duration.
	Clearly identify who is involved in the agreement, and whether fighting with any groups not party to the agreement is permissible.
	Precisely establish areas of ceasefire, whether troops need to disengage or withdraw, and where troops must be relocated if withdrawing.
	Decide what happens after disengagement (whether troops must be disarmed, decommissioned or downsized) as well as any transitional periods to peace are established.
	Identify who will be the monitors (such as U.N. peacekeepers), where they will be located and whether they are to be armed.
	Establish methods to verify parties adhering to the agreement, what happens if the agreement is violated, and possibly a complaint process.
	Outline how casualties and former combatants will be treated, including the release of prisoners of war. (For example, some ceasefires offer immunity to soldiers, or in other cases child soldiers need to be rehabilitated).
	Determine how humanitarian aid can be delivered.
	Estimate the costs of implementing the ceasefire and establish how it will be funded.

Demilitarized zone
A demilitarized zone is an area established by a ceasefire or other agreement where parties have agreed to eliminate either all military presence or certain military installations and equipment, such as heavy weaponry. Heavy weapons can include tanks, mortars and rockets, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapons, or other weapons that could not typically be carried and operated by a single person.
DMZs are generally considered neutral territory that neither side of a conflict controls.
One of the longest held demilitarized zones (or DMZ) is on the Korean peninsula separating North and South Korea. The DMZ runs just over 1.2 miles (2 km) on each side of the ceasefire line established by the armistice agreement that ended fighting in the Korean War (1950-1953). The 2.5 mile-wide area runs about 160 miles (257 km) across the peninsula. The “truce village,” the site of various negotiations between the sides and with the United Nations, is located within the DMZ.
While historically heavy weapons were prohibited within the DMZ itself (and only individual firearms were permitted), both the North and South maintain fortified areas just above and below the DMZ. (Occasional fighting has occurred in the area through the decades.)
De-escalation area
A de-escalation area is essentially another name for an area established by a ceasefire agreement. It refers to an area where sides of a conflict agree to cease hostilities. 
In the Syrian war, for instance, Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government and rebel groups agreed last year to establish four de-escalation zones where the sides agreed to stop fighting and airstrikes for six months. Some military sources also refer to the zones as “de-confliction” areas. (The agreement did not apply to fighting the Islamic State group.) 
Peace treaty
Peace treaties formally mark the end of a war, and establish the terms of peace, territorial control and sometimes reparations. War reparations are payments one side requires the other to compensate the costs of war or aggression.
For example, the Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended World War I, required Germany to pay $33 billion (the equivalent of roughly $450 billion in today’s currency) in reparations. Many historians argue that Germans’ resentment over the amount of reparations contributed to support for the Nazi party, which stopped payments while in power. Germany did not make its final WWI reparation payment until 2010. (The treaty also demilitarized the Rhineland, required Germany to limit the size of its military, established territorial borders, and required the Germans to accept full responsibility for the war.)

42492,2018-09-19,"The parties involved in the Syrian War, explained","The current war in Syria began in March 2011 after government forces fired on protestors in the Syrian city of Daraa, killing four people. 
The protests at the time were part of the “Arab Spring,” a movement in which pro-democratic protestors in countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya attempted to change their government leadership. That March, the protests began to occur in Syria, and security forces reportedly started to arrest protestors and respond violently. Protests were then held in several cities around the country. 
The conflict developed into a civil war, with groups that aligned with Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government fighting various groups that claimed to be against his government. There are additional militant groups in the area, such as the Islamic State, which are opposed by both the government and other rebel groups. 
Below we’ll explore the various alliances and factions involved in war.
Countries and groups supporting Assad’s government
Foreign support
Russia, Iran and Iraq have given military aid to the Syrian government in the form of equipment, soldiers and financing. Russia has also conducted airstrikes against groups that oppose the government. Iran has encouraged Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Islamist group, to aid the Syrian government during the war, BBC reported.
While China has not reportedly been involved in the fighting in Syria, it has made public statements in support of the Syrian government. Egypt has reportedly provided public support for the Syrian government as well, allowing Russia to use its airfields to transport wounded soldiers.
Domestic support
Aside from the aid from foreign nations, Assad, who is an Alawite Muslim, also has support from many Syrians belonging to the country’s Alawite minority. Many of the protestors belonged to the country’s Sunni majority, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, while many of the security forces that acted against the protestors were Alawites, a minority Muslim group that follows Shiite Islam. 
Groups opposing Assad’s government
Foreign opposition
Turkey, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, France and the U.K. have provided military aid such as equipment, soldiers and financing to groups that oppose the Syrian government. The U.S., U.K. and France also launched direct airstrikes on Syrian military targets after Assad’s government allegedly carried out a chemical weapons attack with sarin gas.
Jens Stoltenberg, head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has said that all NATO allies support the air attacks carried out by U.S., U.K. and French military forces on chemical weapons targets associated with the Syrian government.
Israel has also carried out airstrikes in Syria, reportedly against Hezbollah. In February of this year, it also announced that it had carried out a “large-scale” aerial attack in Syria against Iranian drones. 
Domestic opposition
Domestic opposition to Assad and his government involves multiple factions that have changed names, merged or separated over the course of Syria’s civil war. Syrian residents who oppose Assad and the government mostly belong to the country’s Sunni majority. 
Supreme Military Council
The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was one of the first opposition groups to emerge after the Arab Spring protests. Other militant groups adopted the FSA banner, but they were not centrally controlled by an FSA military commander. 
The various FSA-related militant groups attempted to better align themselves in 2012 through the formation of the Supreme Military Council (SMC), which included one representative from each opposition “front,” or region in which groups were fighting Assad-aligned forces. SMC-affiliated militant groups include the Martyrs of Syria Brigades, the Northern Storm Brigade and the Ahrar Souriya Brigade. Some SMC-aligned militant groups work with groups that the U.S. has labeled as “terrorists,” including al-Qaida, BBC reported.
Some independent militant groups, such as the Ahfad al-Rasoul Brigades and the Durou al-Thawra Commission, align with the SMC but do not participate in the group’s regional organization.
Islamic Front
In 2013, several Islamic militant groups aligned to form the Islamic Front. Their mission was to fully overthrow the Assad government and build a new Islamic state, according to BBC. The Islamic Front has reportedly driven out SMC militant groups from certain areas in Syria. Other SMC militant groups, such as the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front, have disbanded to join the Islamic Front. Although the Islamic Front has called for any foreign group to support them “in jihad,” the coalition doesn’t include groups such as Al Nusra or the Islamic State (IS).
Un-aligned groups
‘Terrorist’ factions
While different countries and groups involved in Syria may have different definitions for what constitutes a “terrorist” faction, the U.S. and U.K. governments consider the Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State groups to be “terrorist” groups fighting in Syria. These groups have fought groups aligned with the Syrian government as well as opposition militant groups for territorial control of the region.
Al Nusra has reportedly been supported by IS and is linked to al-Qaida in Iraq. Al Nusra has maintained a presence in Idlib, eastern Ghouta, northern Hama, and western Aleppo provinces, according to Al Jazeera.
IS currently has a small presence in eastern Syria. The U.N. estimated that IS, also sometimes called ISIS, ISIL, Da’esh or the Levant, has about 10,000 fighters remaining in Syria.
Kurdish groups
The group known as Popular Protection Units, or YPG, has links to the Kurdish political party in Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting the Turkish government for autonomy. Turkey opposes the YPG for this reason. The YPG has taken over areas of Syria where government-aligned forces have retreated. 
The YPG have fought both government and opposition-aligned forces. In February, the YPG asked for Syrian government assistance in defending Afrin, located in northwestern Syria near the Turkish border, against Turkish fighters. Although the government declined to assist the YPG, it did allow the group to send reinforcements through government-held territory.
The U.S. government armed the YPG from 2014 until November 2017, after President Donald Trump told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that the U.S. would no longer do so, reportedly at Erdoğan’s request.

42549,2018-09-20,"North Korea agrees to close nuclear test site, pending US actions","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed on Wednesday to permanently shut down an engine test site and missile launch pad at the Dongchang-ri base, also known as Sohae Satellite Launching Station, on the country’s west coast. He also agreed to permanently dismantle North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear facility “contingent upon corresponding measures by the United States,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a statement. 
Moon made the announcement after the two leaders met in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, to discuss implementation of the Panmunjom declaration that both countries agreed to in April of this year. The declaration included a commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and strengthen inter-Korean diplomacy. 
While the leaders didn’t specify the measures they want the U.S. to take in order for North Korea to dismantle the nuclear facility, Moon said the Koreas would “closely consult and cooperate with the United States and the international community” as they denuclearize the peninsula.
When asked about the “corresponding measures,” President Donald Trump said, “We’ll see what he’s looking at. We’ll see. But in the meantime, we’re talking. It’s very calm. He’s calm; I’m calm. So we’ll see what happens.”
Kim promised to allow international inspectors to monitor the closing of the Dongchang-ri missile test site and launch pad, The Associated Press reported. Wednesday’s announcement did not include a timetable for the dismantlement of the country’s missile facilities, and didn’t say how many facilities and launch sites North Korea has or plans to dismantle.
Moon said the two leaders also agreed to establish an inter-Korean military committee “to enable constant consultations on implementing military-related agreements.” 
Moon also noted that the two countries would work to reconnect railroads and roads on their eastern and western coastal regions within the year, increase tourism at North Korea’s Geumgang Mountain, and restore the Geumgang reunion center to facilitate video conference reunions among inter-Korean families.
The Koreas also plan to bid to jointly host the 2032 Summer Olympics.

42538,2018-09-21,A timeline of President Trump’s immigration-related actions,"President Donald Trump’s election campaign included promises to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, impose a temporary moratorium on Muslims entering the country and change other immigration policies. Below is a timeline of the Trump administration’s immigration-related actions to date, as well as corresponding court cases and media reports.
2017
Jan. 25: Five days after his inauguration, Trump signs two executive orders relating to immigration. One order prevents “sanctuary cities,” which are cities that do not comply with requests from federal immigration officials, from being eligible for federal funding. The order also prioritizes the deportation of immigrants who have been charged with or convicted of a criminal offense. (This policy is later ruled unenforceable in federal court.) The second order calls for construction of a “physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel.”
Jan. 27: Trump signs an executive order suspending the country’s refugee admission program for 120 days, limiting the total number of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. in 2017 to fewer than 50,000, and completely suspending the admission of refugees from Syria. The order also prohibits people from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days, citing protection against “foreign terrorists” as reasoning.
Feb. 3: Judge James Robart of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington issues a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the Jan. 27 executive order nationwide. Robart rules that the order adversely affects the state’s residents in areas of employment, business, education, family relations and “freedom to travel.”
Feb. 9: A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upholds Robart’s ruling. The panel says the Trump administration didn’t provide evidence that people from the listed countries “perpetrated a terrorist act” in the U.S.
March 6: Trump signs a new executive order temporarily suspending immigration and travel by nationals Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, again citing the need to protect the U.S. from “terrorist activities” by foreign nationals.
March 15: U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii blocks the March 6 executive order before it is scheduled to take effect. Watson agrees with the Ninth Circuit ruling on the earlier order.
March 20: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issues its first weekly Declined Detainer Outcome Report. The report lists jurisdictions that choose not to cooperate with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “detainers or requests for notification” on undocumented immigrants who have been arrested on local criminal charges or who are in local custody.
April 18: Trump signs the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order, which, among other things, directs officials to develop new regulations to prevent alleged “fraud or abuse” of the U.S. immigration system. The order also directs the officials to suggest reforms to help ensure that H-1B travel visas are awarded to “the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.”
June 15: DHS Secretary John Kelly rescinds the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy, which was used to defer deportation of certain undocumented parents of U.S. citizens if they had been in the U.S. since January 2010. Kelly says there is “no credible path forward to litigate” the policy, which had been litigated by the state of Texas prior to Trump’s inauguration. The policy was placed on hold in 2015 by a federal court in Texas and had never been implemented.
June 26: The U.S. Supreme Court allows enforcement of a limited version of the March executive order restricting travel, after federal courts had stayed the order. The Supreme Court rules it can be enforced on people with no “bona fide” tie to the U.S., such as people with family in the U.S. or attending school.
July 25: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces that localities receiving Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) would need to 1) allow federal immigration officials access to local corrections facilities to question prisoners about their immigration status, and 2) provide DHS with at least 48 hours’ notice prior to releasing undocumented immigrants. The grants are a main source of funding for local law enforcement and judicial programs.
Sept. 5: Sessions announces plans to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by March 5, 2018. Started in 2012, DACA allowed certain people who were illegally brought into the U.S. as minors to receive two-year renewable work permits, driver’s licenses and education funding. (Several individuals and advocacy groups then sue the Trump administration for rescinding DACA, resulting in several injunctions and appeals.)
Sept. 18: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sends a memo to U.S. embassies changing visa guidelines. According to the memo, people who obtain a visa for the U.S. must adhere to their stated reasons for entering the U.S. for three months instead of the previous period of one month. If they do something not mentioned in the visa application, such as get a job or get married, the U.S. would presumed they have lied, potentially prohibiting them from receiving another visa to enter the U.S.
Sept. 24: Trump signs a new executive order that restricts or limits the entry of people from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. The administration says the countries have “inadequate identity-management protocols, information-sharing practices and risk factors.”
Nov. 20: Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke announces the termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Haitians living and working in the U.S. as a result of Haiti’s 2010 earthquake. Haitians have until July 22, 2018, to return to the island or apply for lawful immigration status, if eligible. The government cites improvements to the country since the earthquake as the reason for terminating TPS.
2018
Jan. 8: DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announces the termination of the TPS for Salvadorans living and working in the U.S. since El Salvador’s 2001 earthquake. Salvadorans have until Sept. 9, 2019, to return to their country or apply for lawful immigration status, if eligible. Nielsen says since the “original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist,” TPS for Salvadorans must be terminated.
April 2: The DOJ sends a memo to immigration judges saying they must close at least 700 immigration cases a year. It is the first time the DOJ places a quota on immigration judges.
April 6: Sessions announces a new “zero-tolerance policy” for illegal entry into the U.S. Sessions says anyone entering the U.S. illegally will be met with “the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice,” and that as a result children will be separated from parents found illegally crossing the border. 
April 19: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh District upholds a previous court decision that placed an injunction on Sessions’ rule regarding the distribution of Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants.
April 20: The New York Times reports that the Trump administration has separated more than 700 immigrant children from adults claiming to be their parents since October, including more than 100 children under the age of 4. The children had reportedly been taken from their parents after crossing the U.S. border.
April 24: District Court Judge John Bates rules in favor of people representing the rights of DACA recipients. As a result of the ruling, the U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services (USCIS) once again accepts first-time applications for DACA, as well as DACA renewals.
May 7: Sessions announces that DHS will refer 100 percent of illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border to the DOJ for prosecution. Sessions also says there will be a 50 percent increase in the number of immigration judges to handle asylum claims.

42522,2018-09-22,"Vietnamese president dies of ‘serious illness,’ state media reports","Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, 61, died in a military hospital in Hanoi on Friday from a “serious illness,” according to a government statement published by state media. The statement said Quang passed after the “utmost efforts to treat him by Vietnamese and foreign professors and doctors and care by the party and state leaders.” The statement did not specify what the illness was. 
Nguyen Quoc Trieu, the former health minister, was quoted in state-run online newspaper VnExpress saying that Quang had been sick due to a rare toxic virus he contracted last year, without naming the virus. The president had traveled to Japan multiple times for treatment, Trieu said. 
“Japanese professors and doctors treated him and helped consolidate the president’s health for about a year,” Trieu said. “However, there are no medicines in the world that can cure the illness completely, instead it only could prevent and push it back for some time.”
Quang’s last public appearance was on Wednesday at a Communist Party meeting and reception for a public delegation. Quang had been president since April 2016. 
In Vietnam, the presidency is the second highest political position in the country, after the leader of the Communist Party, according to The Associated Press. The Communist Party holds 475 of the 500 seats in the National Assembly. Only between 25 and 50 non-Communist Party candidates ran as candidates in the last election, according to 2016 remarks made by the Chairman of the National Assembly, Nguyen Sinh Hung.
The National Assembly is scheduled to convene next month and elect a new president, AP reported. The current vice president is Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh. If elected, she would become the country’s first female president.

42517,2018-09-22,US sanctions China for buying Russian military equipment,"The U.S. sanctioned China for purchasing combat aircraft and surface-to-air missile system equipment from Russia, the U.S. State Department announced on Thursday. The State Department said the sanctions were intended to impose penalties on Russia in response to its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, its “unacceptable behavior” in eastern Ukraine regarding Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and other unspecified “malign activities.” 
The State Department said it would impose sanctions on China’s military acquisitions branch, the Equipment Development Department (EDD), and the department’s director, Li Shangfu, for engaging in “significant transactions” with Rosoboronexport, Russia’s state-owned arms exporter.
The EDD reportedly bought 10 Su-35 combat aircraft in December 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018 from Rosoboronexport.
The sanctions imposed on the EDD prohibit it from financial and foreign exchange transactions under U.S. jurisdiction. The State Department imposed the same sanctions on Li, and barred Li from acquiring a U.S. visa. The sanctions also block companies and individuals within the U.S. from doing business with the EDD or Li.
The sanctions also include denying the EDD export licenses, which are generally required by the U.S. government for the export of munitions under the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. 
China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said Friday that the sanctions “violated the basic norms governing international relations and seriously damaged the relations between the two countries and the two militaries.” Geng said the transaction between China and Russia was part of their mutual cooperation in relation to defense and that the purchase did not violate international law.
Geng added, “We strongly urge the U.S. side to immediately correct their mistake and withdraw their so-called sanctions, otherwise the U.S. will have to bear the consequences.”
The State Department also added 33 additional entities and individuals on Thursday to a list of people and businesses known to operate for or on behalf of the defense or intelligence sectors of the Russian government. 
“Persons that knowingly engage in significant transactions with any person on the [aforementioned list] are subject to sanctions,” the State Department said.

42528,2018-09-23,Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh’s confirmation delayed; accuser Ford agrees to testify,"Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet been scheduled, after delays following an accusation of sexual misconduct in high school. 
Psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford has alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a house party when they were both teenagers. Both attended high school in Maryland, where she attended an all-girls and Kavanaugh attended an all-boys school. Kavanaugh denies the allegation. 
Ford had initially sent a private letter about the alleged incident to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and requested it not be made public. The senator forwarded the letter to the F.B.I., and Ford later came forward publicly. The Senate Judiciary Committee has delayed a vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Both Ford, through her lawyer, and Kavanaugh had said they would testify before the committee on the matter. 
On Saturday, Ford’s lawyers confirmed to the committee that Ford accepted a request to testify. “Dr. Ford accepts the Committee's request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct next week,” the lawyers said. The date for the testimony was tentatively scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 27. 
Ford, Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh’s wife have all received violent threats over the allegations; the F.B.I is investigating the threats. 
Maryland does not have a statute of limitations on felony sexual offense criminal cases, which would include attempted rape. 
Timeline 
1982: Ford and Kavanaugh were 15 and 17 years old, respectively, and attended different Maryland high schools. Ford later alleged that while at a house party they both attended, Kavanaugh was intoxicated, pushed her into a bedroom, locked the door, tried to grope her, tried to remove her clothes, and put his hand over her mouth while a male friend of Kavanaugh was in the room. Ford said the friend was laughing. Ford said she was able to leave the room after the friend jumped on top of them, and Kavanaugh and the friend fought. She later tells the media that she did not tell anyone about the incident at the time. Kavanaugh and the male friend deny the incident. 
2012: Ford discusses the incident in couple’s therapy with her husband, according to a therapist’s notes Ford later provides to The Washington Post. Ford said she mentioned Kavanaugh’s name; the notes do not include a name. A therapist’s notes from the following year with a session with Ford mention a “rape attempt.”
July 9, 2018: President Trump nominates Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. 
Late July: Ford sends a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) detailing the allegation, and asking to keep the matter confidential.
Early August: Ford takes a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent, on the advice of her lawyer. The polygraph test does not show her to be lying about her recollection. (The Supreme Court will not accept polygraph tests as evidence due to inconclusive evidence of their validity, but the tests are sometimes used by law enforcement during the investigation process, according to the American Psychological Association.)
Sept. 4-7: The Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearings on Kavanaugh’s potential confirmation to the Supreme Court. 
Sept. 12: The Intercept reports that Feinstein has the letter about the allegation against Kavanaugh and would not share it with other senators. The following day, Feinstein says she referred the matter to law enforcement.
Sept. 14: The New Yorker reports on the allegations without naming Ford, followed by other media outlets. Kavanaugh “categorically and unequivocally” denies the allegation in a statement issued by the White House. Senate Republicans release a letter from 65 women who says they knew Kavanaugh while he was in high school, claiming he behaved “honorably.”
Sept. 16: The Washington Post publishes an article about the allegations in which Ford agrees to be publicly named for the first time. 
Sept. 17: Ford’s lawyer says her client would be willing to speak publicly to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh also says he would be willing to testify before the committee about the matter.
Trump says regarding the confirmation process, “if it takes a little delay, it’ll take a little delay.” Ten Democrat senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee say the FBI should investigate the matter before they vote. The panel postpones a vote on Kavanaugh that was scheduled for Sept. 20. 
Sept. 18: Former students at Ford’s high school who knew her release a letter attesting to her “her honesty, integrity, and intelligence.”
Sept. 19: Ford’s lawyer tells The New York Times that due to the number of death threats her client has received, she has relocated out of her home. Multiple media sources later report on threats received by Ford, Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh’s wife. 
Sept. 20: The media reports on a letter to the committee from Ford’s lawyer. In it, she repeats that Ford would be willing to testify to the committee “next week” if it is done under “fair” conditions that “ensure her safety.” 
Sept. 21: Ford’s lawyers discuss conditions for Ford’s potential testimony before the committee, including a request that Kavanaugh not be present in the room when she is, that the other boy who Ford says was in the room be subpoenaed, and that Kavanaugh be questioned before Ford to not be influenced by her testimony. 
Ford’s lawyer requests the testimony not be before Thursday, Sept. 27. Senate Republicans suggest that Ford testify on Wednesday, Sept. 26, with some requesting Monday, Sept. 24. 
Kavanaugh has not requested specific conditions for his testimony. 
Also on Sept. 21, Trump releases a series of tweets about the allegations (here, here, here, here and here), including saying that “if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.” He also accused Democrats of obstructing the confirmation process by waiting until after hearings to release the letter. 
Sept. 22: Ford’s lawyers send a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying Ford “accepts the Committee’s request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct next week.” The date is reportedly set for Sept. 27.
